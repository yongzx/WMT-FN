<seg id="1">The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed that are officially supported by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several variants of contact tracking applications have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This has spurred a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Softer options include using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate support for such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government, together with Alipay, has rolled out an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">Developed by local IT companies, the app is open source and will be handed over to the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">The app was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that a contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within weeks, with similar apps planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a security professor at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with app-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the app is used by only a small fraction of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can offer its coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to include only "official" or other trusted organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the impact of mass surveillance of the public through coronavirus-related apps, including whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with a coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for such surveillance to be curtailed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations announced eight conditions for their public projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate."</seg>
<seg id="21">Expanded monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by sunset clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">The use of data should be limited to combating the spread of COVID-19;</seg>
<seg id="23">The security and anonymity of data must be protected, and evidence of such protection must be provided;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;</seg>
<seg id="26">Protection against abuse must be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="29">In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, eliminating the need to download the app and avoid tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that have access to raw location data also have large potential privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="35">Not only has the government used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected individuals, but it has also made location information publicly available, made possible by significant changes in data protection legislation since the MERS outbreak in that country.</seg>
<seg id="36">Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, details had not yet been released.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and that all comparisons take place on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform builds on research in Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is SafeTrace, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology that allows users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was founded by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global interoperability of tracking and reporting applications, which is key to their widespread adoption.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official app.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, which they claimed would ensure privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptography.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Deployment of tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movements of citizens infected with coronavirus, while preserving data privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address ongoing surveillance issues by first implementing the system through updates to the operating system, and then removing it in the same way once the threat has disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning hands to remove impurities, fat, germs, or other harmful substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular hand-washing with soap at certain "critical points" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral transmission.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person can also contract respiratory diseases, such as flu or a common cold, for example, by touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five critical points during the day to wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing your child's buttocks or changing nappies, before feeding your child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during, and after cooking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after care procedures.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing nappies or flushing a child going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After shriveling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hand hygiene refers to hygienic practices associated with medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wash your hands before taking medication or medical procedures to prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, and reduces the spread of respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="16">It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in home births.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight increase in growth in children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This basic procedure can reduce mortality from these diseases by up to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory disease (ARI), provided appropriate habits are developed in every home, school, and other public places around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, a major complication of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing an estimated 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Overall, diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund reports that hand-washing with soap before and after meals, which has become a habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out by WASH programs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can cause skin to dry out and, consequently, damage it.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that washing hands too often can lead to itching and skin peeling, a condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Too much hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing a child's buttocks (changing nappies), before feeding the child, before eating, and before / after cooking or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent disease transmission: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shriveling, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">Hand washing with soap is relatively uncommon in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, 97%; the United States was near the middle, at 77%; China had the lowest rate, at 23%.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Philippine Department of Education's Emergency Medical Program is an example of a large-scale effort to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">This national program is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoride.</seg>
<seg id="36">The same program is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added to the washing process.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main effect of soaps and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone is not considered an effective skin cleanser, because fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sufficient water, however, facilitates the purification process.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, because of its repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it during previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies on the ingestion of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggest a low probability of ingestion, as the bacteria are washed away with foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still claims that hand-held liquid soap is the preferred option for hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soaps are actively promoted in health-conscious communities.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antiseptic or disinfectant has a selective effect on organisms that are naturally resistant to antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soaps, their effectiveness may not match that advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactant and skin protection, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water at a comfortable temperature for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature of 37 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water in removing natural fats that trap contaminants and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial burden on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand hygiene product.</seg>
<seg id="54">Alcohol-based hand sanitizers without water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity in the late 1990s and early 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in gel form, or humidifiers, such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively kill germs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a logarithm reduction of 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria (a logarithm reduction of 4: 5) on hands 1 minute after application.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.</seg>
<seg id="60">The front and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingertips of both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing hand washing over disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="62">The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing if water and soap are available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain skin softeners and / or moisturisers.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and / or other softeners to the product.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening ingredients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in choosing disinfectants over soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, because they still leave pathogens in the hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or spirits.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can increase the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.</seg>
<seg id="76">If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="77">To prevent infection, the US Centers for Disease Control recommends using hand-washing techniques that include the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is running water that is recommended, because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap (rather than just water).</seg>
<seg id="82">Shake your hands for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Rinsing hands in standing water can trigger re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="86">Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet and wet hands are easier to contaminate. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="90">If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or hole-in-the-wall pumpkin, and / or using ash when necessary, as is the case in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">The foot pedal faucet is a simple design consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to release water on the hands, using a piece of soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Napkins and Towels, conducted by the University of Westminster in London, compared the hygiene of paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern streaming hand dryers.</seg>
<seg id="95">They found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the pads of fingers increased by 194% on average, and on the palms by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">They also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the pads of the fingers increased by 42% and on the palms by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing and drying your hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on your finger pads drops to 76% on average, and on your palms to 77%.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms off the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet and toilet users within a radius of up to 2 metres.</seg>
<seg id="99">Using hand dryers with warm air spreads germs within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study evaluating different methods of hand drying.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">Cleaning hands with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospital settings.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.</seg>
<seg id="107">According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection rates.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water, or gel is used to wash and wipe each part of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, fingers crossed.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Because germs can remain in the water present on your hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying your hands, close the tap and, if necessary, close and open any doors, use a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="113">This avoids re-contamination of hands from these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogens ("germs") and prevent their spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing practices remain unacceptable in most health facilities, with large numbers of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spreading germs.</seg>
<seg id="116">According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce catheter-related blood-flow infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet outlining standard hand washing and treatment procedures to be used in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="117">The WHO's draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby co-authored the review.</seg>
<seg id="119">If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and test hand hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization identifies five things to do when washing your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">after contact with blood or bodily fluids,</seg>
<seg id="122">before using antiseptic, as well as</seg>
<seg id="123">Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand-washing soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment high in antibiotic-resistant organisms.</seg>
<seg id="125">All decorations must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need to rub your hands for too long, say 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="128">During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand antiseptic before and after care.</seg>
<seg id="131">To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the first 20% of hand washing was found to be the most beneficial, and very few additional benefits were achieved when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted through food. Comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treating hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-washing solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium Difficile spores on the hands. Hand hygiene interventions in health facilities may include training staff to wash their hands, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand-washing solutions, and written and verbal reminders to staff to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed on the most effective interventions in different health-care settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and important for improving health and even digestion.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of stable water, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate the habit of washing hands regularly.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes.</seg>
<seg id="140">To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results must be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based sanitation is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="142">By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can upgrade from one to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Installation of hand washes is one possible measure being implemented as part of hand hygiene awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Global Hand Wash Day is another example of a behavioral change awareness campaign. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of hand-washing emojis.</seg>
<seg id="145">Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (years of life saved without disability).</seg>
<seg id="146">However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and founder of modern nursing.</seg>
<seg id="148">At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten odors called miasmas.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, in response to outbreaks of digestive tract diseases and health-care-related infections, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">In Germany, for example, posters with "proper hand-washing techniques" were posted next to hand-washing machines in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "wash your hands" means showing your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be part of something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate washed his hands when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, a phrase that has since become more widely used in some English communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain, symbolizing an impure conscience, for the crimes she committed and induced her husband to commit.</seg>
<seg id="155">It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act were more likely to wash their hands more often than other people, and handwashes were more important to them.</seg>
<seg id="156">It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after seeing them will engage in other cleansing and compensatory activities, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water but no soap is part of a ritual prescribed in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing, especially after certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity, with more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections in China and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2">Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid growth of publications on the new disease, this paper offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of research.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and in the weeks following the outbreak of a new viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the concomitant disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, starting with the first report on January 7, 2020, which sequenced the virus from a range of patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which erupted in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss currently known facts about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some other equally pressing issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not lethal to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases 4.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet we have twice this century been confronted with highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, that is, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, which caused an outbreak initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling levels of disease severity and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in figure 1.1, clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, it became known that health workers had been infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and public transport in the city stopped working.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical trial of the disease found that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infections had direct contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).</seg>
<seg id="28">Given the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scale and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multi-center clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 infections affected all age groups, but mostly affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31 / 100,000) than among women (0.27 / 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei Province and surrounding regions.</seg>
<seg id="34">On average, it took 5 (2 / 9) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">It took an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days from the onset of symptoms to death.</seg>
<seg id="37">The benchmark reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with large-scale transport movements on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mortality among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses that contain a single strand of semantic RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to affect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the membrane spikes (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence appeared on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome matches 99.98% of the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">The human enzyme ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which explains why SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower degree of disease in patients than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and a secreted protein encoded orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motive.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryo-electron tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 º in combination with the amino acid conveyor B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which is evidence for recognizing and infecting a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and Intermediate Host</seg>
<seg id="57">Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were identified as the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely, bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission also remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr Ji and his colleagues hypothesized that snakes were transmitting the virus from bats to humans, resulting in a homologous recombination in the S-protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">In their study, Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that pangolins, long-necked mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that final results with concrete evidence are not yet available (figure 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the activity of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so humans are susceptible to the new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4) .4).</seg>
<seg id="70">Typically, the host virus is first recognized by the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORR), including lectin C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.</seg>
<seg id="71">Through various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, an adaptive immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, while CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, a coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies released from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the immune system's overreaction leads to the local production of large amounts of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to multi-organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">People who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have compromised immune systems are more likely to become infected.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a review of data from the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A more recent study, based on data from 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to reflect the best estimates of the incubation period, thereby preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with asymptomatic disease.</seg>
<seg id="87">A 14-day quarantine period for people who have been in contact with or infected with the virus has become common practice.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">The primary and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often a fever, which may be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as a dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experienced shortness of breath and / or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with high fever and / or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no abnormalities in the chest images.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following prevalence rates of symptoms: 98% high fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% required artificial lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have emerged from two recent studies of family infections and transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="95">Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, a rate much higher than that of COVID-19 patients, and corresponding to a higher proportion of MERS deaths than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhea (26%) and sore throats (21%).</seg>
<seg id="98">The main symptoms of SARS patients are fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), shortness of breath (40% -42%), diarrhea (20% -25%) and sore throat (13% -25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required in 14% -20% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, deaths from COVID-19 stood at 2%, bringing the total number of confirmed cases worldwide to 66,576.</seg>
<seg id="100">By comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2-4.</seg>
<seg id="103">A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures show a higher transmission capacity for SARS-CoV-2 than for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for the new virus is lower than for the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster manifestations often occur when an infection occurs within a family or group of people who have come together for some reason, or who have ended up together on some form of transport, such as a cruise liner.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or came into contact with infected or sick people in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, according to the reports, people can carry the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and treated patients who are released from hospital may become carriers of the virus again, a worrying sign for the extension of the quarantine period.</seg>
<seg id="109">At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphopenia with white blood cell levels &gt; 4 × 109 / L, including white blood cell levels &gt; 1 × 109 / L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-aminotransferase and virosemia.</seg>
<seg id="111">Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in their blood, while most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe disease, levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, were raised and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">In most patients with COVID-19, a chest X-ray revealed abnormalities characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or "frosted glass "-type blackouts in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARI).</seg>
<seg id="115">In the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Pneumocyte dysfunction of types I and II lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the separation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaluronic membranes, and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, and the multicurrent syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="119">The primary criterion used in diagnosing COVID-19 was the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).</seg>
<seg id="120">However, given the high rate of false-negative results, which could accelerate the epidemic, as of February 13, 2020, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">The same was true of SARS diagnostics.</seg>
<seg id="122">Thus, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and X-ray results is critical and necessary for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for using the SHERLOCK method, based on CRISPR repetition, to detect SARS-CoV-2, a technique that detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at densities ranging from 20 × 10 × 18 mol / L to 200 × 10 × 18 mol / L (10 × 100 copies per microliter of the original sample) in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.</seg>
<seg id="124">This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.</seg>
<seg id="125">Owing to a lack of experience in dealing with a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide patients with COVID-19 with only maintenance therapy, while trying to apply any therapies that have been used or proposed for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2) .2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapies include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patients "plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Drug companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, but also, perhaps to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are prescribed according to the severity of the disease, is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">Moreover, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="134">Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an overreaction by the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines induce immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main cause of ARI and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunity suppression is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe conditions.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that act as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immune-suppressing treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of immune responses to control T-cells; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; blinatumab, cytokine signal suppressors 4, and histondeaacetalase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids are widely used as immune suppressants to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, high-dose steroids are not helpful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of low and medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">More recently, Remdesivir has also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for a pair of studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="151">Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.</seg>
<seg id="152">The plasma of recovered patients and the production of antibodies</seg>
<seg id="153">Blood collection from patients cured of a contagious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="154">Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.</seg>
<seg id="156">On the basis of this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then injected into 10 seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, to suggest that this method should be used en masse before specific therapies are carried out requires an as-yet-untested test and clarification.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, given the therapeutic effect, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma use should be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is needed to treat patients in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B-cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies, or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can move immediately to mass production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">For millennia, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, because it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, in the absence of effective specific COVID-19 therapies, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe illness.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were in a number of Chinese provinces, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a rough comparison, because the assessment must take into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively using Western medicine and combined treatment using Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time taken to normalize body temperature, eliminate symptoms, and provide in-patient care was significantly shorter for patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients treated only with Western methods.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to worsen (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the former group was lower than in the latter (8.8% versus 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is also of some interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques, or a combination of them.</seg>
<seg id="177">Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 generally experience a strong fear of a highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="178">Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing, as well as side effects of treatment such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine, and social stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Psychological and psychiatric care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, those suspected of having come into contact with them, and all other people who require it.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the transmission chain from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Work has been done on S-protein-based vaccines, which aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, before clinical trials can begin, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in vivo in age-group patients, the pattern of exposure to lethal doses, and the degree of protection against infection by zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="187">Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since then.</seg>
<seg id="188">At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that must be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, there are serious difficulties due to the long lead time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only just beginning to reveal the full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients recover gradually without complications.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.</seg>
<seg id="195">It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on current clinical trial data, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over the age of 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (on average, 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Morbidity and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver damage in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="205">Deviations identified in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage, and are suggested as a potential predictor of disease progression, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also proposed to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity, and prognosis in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferase, alanin-aminotransferase, and creatinkinase can also predict the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Key clinical symptoms: To predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19 treatment, chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapies to reduce the severity of inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="212">Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, resulting in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in low doses and short courses.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty, and witness the deaths of their relatives and other patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the early stages of infection.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or have not yet completed their incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological surveillance very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were gravely ill, even though most cases did not occur in the early stages of infection.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and more difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">Much work is currently underway in China, including a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and an extension of the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures are causing enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new cases being detected is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and that the phase of extinction will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">But some experts are less optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Researchers from a team led by Ira Longini have created a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A team of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in swabs from the nose and throat taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical illness similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">But the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">Initial predictions were that Ebola would infect up to a million people and kill half a million patients.</seg>
<seg id="230">But strict quarantine and isolation eventually brought the disease under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">It is possible that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken and, over time, disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics follows (Fig. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been detected in feces, meaning that oral fecal transmission is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="235">According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues, and even bystanders who come into contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both surgical masks and Class N95 respirators (series 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent microdroplets of fluid from potentially infected people from flying through the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only Class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions between 10 and 80 nm in size, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.</seg>
<seg id="240">Because particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked together, health-care workers who come into direct contact with patients must wear Class N95 masks (series 1860s), not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health workers should wear a figure-fitting protective robe to further reduce exposure to viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective glasses.</seg>
<seg id="245">All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are strongly advised to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant detergents, avoid leaving their homes in self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">An acceptable distance to the patient is about a metre.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given its experience during the 2003 SARS outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, it was only after January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproduction in human-to-human transmission, and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease would not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">The announcement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal casualties.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word counts for citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger action to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages, rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly test and improve public response.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome II coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak created a sense of relapse in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among the elderly is also higher than among the young.</seg>
<seg id="258">Mortality from SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, whereas patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases, so containing the spread of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Some patients with COVID-19 may test negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, treated patients may again test positive for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.</seg>
<seg id="264">Against the background of this rapid advance in COVID-19 research, some critical questions remain unresolved, namely:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite the discovery of a 96% homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal became an intermediate species that passed the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt transmission, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any moment.</seg>
<seg id="269">Molecular-level modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does a virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or relapse periodically like influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">These aspects are of paramount importance, but finding answers to these and many other questions will take time.</seg>
<seg id="276">But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available in less than 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI's vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, scale-up, and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that, at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technological platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I safety studies are:</seg>
<seg id="11">nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, iRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)</seg>
<seg id="13">As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 candidate vaccines have been announced, but little publicly available information is available (presumably in the planning or development stages).</seg>
<seg id="14">Phases I-II include preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site, with more accurate and effective doses determined.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, in which drugs are tested for efficacy in preventing disease, while side effects are monitored at optimal doses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical studies).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine, with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.</seg>
<seg id="20">On January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of work on their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="33">On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle similar to a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on iRNA.</seg>
<seg id="37">BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh.</seg>
<seg id="40">CEPI's other investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford, and Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.</seg>

<seg id="44">At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national vaccine bank that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, saying that MNA administered subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that showed up two weeks after immunization.</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, possibly in the form of a nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities combined IBM supercomputers with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they may have other benefits besides disease prevention properties.</seg>
<seg id="52">Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Vaccines under development may prove unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies evaluating the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, point to the need for containment measures with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and gut.</seg>
<seg id="2">AC2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for treating cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptide domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzyme-active domain reaching the surface of lung cells and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extracellular domain ACE2 is broken off from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, splits the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Strictly speaking, binding the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires priming the S protein with the serine protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, leading some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and BRA inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared to the control group.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia deaths, though the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the exposure time of 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases with elevated circulating angiotensin II.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, an estimated 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing an estimated 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some 364,000 people have recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">China's mortality rate is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance between people, and identifying and isolating people suspected of being infected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls, and closures.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schools and universities have been closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4% of students worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and Southeast Asian citizens, or people who resemble them, and other groups of people living in areas where the virus has spread significantly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reduced travel and heavy industry closures have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cases were mainly linked to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears a strong resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two-thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had declined, but had increased unexpectedly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, with new infections outside China surpassing the number of new infections in China for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of cases may be significantly underestimated, in part because of the large number of cases with mild symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="23">The statistics include cases of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have adopted official policies not to test for only minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China by January 23, and that such unreported cases were the source of 79% of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual cases in Italy far exceeded the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the figure could be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 recover well.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age, and 75% of those killed had co-morbidity, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 mortality data typically include deaths of patients who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because official figures may not include untested deaths - for example, deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic was four to five times higher than the official figures for COVID.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual number."</seg>
<seg id="36">The first deaths outside mainland China were reported on February 1 in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality / morbidity rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given time interval.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Data vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of disease-related deaths (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of infection-related deaths (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall death rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and the exact duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary from location to location.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University argues that uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to reach a plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers runs out, they begin to fade.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction about when this will happen.</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, says that "everything could be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement the WHO's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 would circulate for perhaps a year or two.</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is developed (perhaps 18 months or more).</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear completely, because it is so easily transmitted, and it can become a seasonal disease that flares up every year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum in the airways (mucus), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis.</seg>
<seg id="59">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or feeling depressed, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips.</seg>
<seg id="60">In some infected people, the disease may be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing those in close contact with confirmed patients under strict control and testing for infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">Chinese scientists estimate that asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44% of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="62">The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">The disease is thought to be mainly transmitted through close contact, but also through small droplets released into the air through coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">According to some studies, droplets can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) in open coughs.</seg>
<seg id="66">There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during a conversation, which can remain in the air for longer. Respiratory droplets can also form during exhalation, including during conversation, though the virus is not usually airborne.</seg>
<seg id="67">Droplets can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="72">There have been cases where tests have been positive three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that the virus can be transmitted before symptoms manifest.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Officials at the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) say it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two to three others, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the virus was found to live on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) for up to three days, on a cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, though British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be eradicated with household soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 bears a strong resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, the genus Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bat viruses.</seg>
<seg id="82">At the genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.</seg>
<seg id="84">Genome-wide comparisons to date have shown that the greatest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though this should eventually be confirmed by a polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (PT-PCR) analysis of the infected secret or a CT scan.</seg>
<seg id="86">A study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, because many of its imaging functions overlap with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnostics.</seg>
<seg id="88">The WHO has published several protocols for testing RNA for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is being conducted.</seg>
<seg id="90">It can be carried out on breath samples and blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually ready within a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="92">A nasopharyngeal swab is usually used for the test, although a yawn swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of them was accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Characteristic features of symptom visualization on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral cloudiness like matt glass and the absence of pleural effusions.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Because of its similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, COVID-19 identifies images that are not confirmed by PCR tests with limited clinical specificity.</seg>
<seg id="98">In China, a major study comparing the results of chest CT and PCR tests found that, while the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and thus can be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands, and using wipes when coughing or sneezing, which should be thrown away immediately after use.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may have already contracted the disease should wear a medical mask in crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="102">To prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many governments advise against all non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="103">Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">Tracking contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">Governments "use of citizens" location data on their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 others have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop privacy solutions, such as recording a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.</seg>
<seg id="107">If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified, and there are unsubstantiated theories about how to prevent infection, such as nasal and mouth rinsing, which is actually ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating, after shriveling, coughing, or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.</seg>
<seg id="112">In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="113">The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">Surfaces can be decontaminated with a range of solutions (the stainless steel surface is disinfected a minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidon-iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all areas of such a facility, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, should be disinfected.</seg>
<seg id="117">Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discarding used hygiene items.</seg>
<seg id="118">Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as using a mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that disperse in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.</seg>
<seg id="119">The WHO has issued guidance on when and how to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main method of infection."</seg>
<seg id="121">The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask does reduce the number of face touches.</seg>
<seg id="122">Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing non-medical tissue face masks.</seg>
<seg id="124">In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask on public transport or in crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials are urging people to make facial tissue masks at home and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks covering their noses and mouths.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, Vietnam's government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government has required all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="130">On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="131">In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those unable to purchase masks have been advised to sew them themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="132">Medical masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection-control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.</seg>
<seg id="134">Protective measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.</seg>
<seg id="135">People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many governments in regions particularly hard hit by the outbreak are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.</seg>
<seg id="137">The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50, and later to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should expose themselves to total social isolation, rather than remaining in contact with others in alternative ways.</seg>
<seg id="140">Among other things, advice has been given to have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live and in whom you are confident that he is free of the virus and its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are advised to isolate themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation, and many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that all people in affected areas quarantine themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">Those in high-risk groups were ordered to undergo the strictest quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="144">Individuals who may have come into contact with COVID-19 infected individuals, or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, have been advised to remain quarantined for 14 days from the last possible contact.</seg>
<seg id="145">Outbreak control strategies include containment, suppression, or mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Controlling the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.</seg>
<seg id="147">When the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are focused on mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be undertaken simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and allow more time to develop vaccines and treatments.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help contain the outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; community-based measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling public events; community involvement in promoting and participating in such measures; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provided financial support to self-isolated infected individuals and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan increased production of medical masks and was fined for stockpiling excess medicines. Modelling in the United Kingdom and the United States showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (slowing, but not stopping, the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (halting the epidemic's growth).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health-care burden by two-thirds and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health-care systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the response is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support.</seg>
<seg id="162">Steroid use can only do harm.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds that were previously approved to treat other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The WHO views capacity-building and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="166">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating confirmed COVID-19 patients, and expanding intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the availability of IVL machines and beds.</seg>
<seg id="167">There are various theories about where the very first case of infection - the so-called "zero patient" - might have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of a new coronavirus infection likely occurred on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei Province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">They were mainly related to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is zoonotic in origin. On 26 December, a massive case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at a clinic in Hubei Province, with which a doctor, Zhang Tianjin, was working and reported the case to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on 27 December.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a coronavirus similar to SARS.</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.</seg>
<seg id="173">Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="174">Health authorities in Wuhan reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled roughly every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the world's most confirmed cases. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 recovered.</seg>
<seg id="178">Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case.</seg>
<seg id="179">Because of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">As of April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were under some form of quarantine, more than 50 million were isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million were isolated in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were isolated in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure had risen to 2.6 billion - about a third of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another unverified report, the date is November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">On December 26, a doctor, Zhang Jixian, was working with a case of a massive case of pneumonia of an unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="185">On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="186">The WHO was notified the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">In response to the notices, police have warned doctors in Wuhan to take responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="188">Initially, China's National Health Commission said there was "no clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus's ability to transmit from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war."</seg>
<seg id="190">The "largest quarantine in human history" began to unfold, with a sanitary cordon and a ban on travel to and from Wuhan announced on January 23, later extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affecting a total of some 57 million people.</seg>
<seg id="191">The city banned the use of private vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="192">Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.</seg>
<seg id="193">The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built to receive other incoming patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and schools were closed across the country.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">In several regions of China, authorities have introduced remote operation.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei Province and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transport has been rescheduled, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">Since the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent imports of the virus from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="202">Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, mainland China had recorded only one case of domestic transmission, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely contained, and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was quarantined. On March 26, 2020, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those wishing to travel to China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.</seg>
<seg id="206">On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages.</seg>
<seg id="207">COVID-19 was confirmed to have entered South Korea on January 20, 2020, from China.</seg>
<seg id="208">On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji in Daegu.</seg>
<seg id="209">Shinchongji's followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, out of 9,336 church members, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.</seg>
<seg id="211">More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, rising to 3,150 on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="213">South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the virus, track contacts, and quarantine contacts.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods included mandatory reporting of symptoms via a mobile app for all foreign visitors, universal testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, and expanded testing capacity, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.</seg>
<seg id="215">South Korea's program is considered successful in containing the outbreak, despite not isolating entire cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On March 29, it was announced that, from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries asked South Korea for assistance in testing for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later in the day.</seg>
<seg id="221">The first measures imposed by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, universities and schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">President Hassan Rouhani announced on February 26, 2020, that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="224">Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but heavy inter-city travel continued ahead of the Persian New Year.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the center of the virus's spread after China in February.</seg>
<seg id="226">Amid claims of a cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28 more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.</seg>
<seg id="228">On March 12, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed settings, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.</seg>
<seg id="231">By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">By March 23, Iran had recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran can be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="235">The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded an easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, placing more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy under quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entry and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.</seg>
<seg id="240">On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths had already been reported in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were supposed to take place behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least a month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for the prioritization of patient care that may have to be put in place.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy overtook China as the world's number one coronavirus killer, with 3,405 deaths reported.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors may contribute to Italy's high mortality rate: the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the inability to screen everyone who currently has a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="247">The UK's response to the virus was the most calm of all the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social exclusion or quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously enough to the dangers facing the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home whenever possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.</seg>
<seg id="249">On 20 March, the Government announced that all leisure facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, but no more than Pound2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population in times of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher measures to distance himself from society, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to cases of extreme need.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the dispersal of crowds.</seg>
<seg id="251">Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide "vital services to the public," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.</seg>
<seg id="252">On January 20, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15.</seg>
<seg id="253">On January 29, the White House created the Coronavirus Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="254">On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed travel restrictions on visitors from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Despite this, testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was obscured.</seg>
<seg id="257">Testing has been hampered by defective test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government authorization by the end of February to use non-government test kits developed by academic organizations, companies, and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done with a doctor's prescription).</seg>
<seg id="258">The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.</seg>
<seg id="259">The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, waited for hours or days for tests." After Washington state reported the first coronavirus death in the United States on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which other states soon declared as well.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3, classes were canceled in Seattle schools, and by mid-March schools were closed across the country. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the projected impact of the new coronavirus on the country.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to the federal government to respond to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="263">Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">Sports events and seasons were canceled. On March 11, Trump announced restrictions on travel to most of Europe, except the United Kingdom, for 30 days, beginning on March 13.</seg>
<seg id="265">The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include Britain and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On March 13, the President declared a national state of emergency, allowing federal funds to be used to deal with the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Since March 15, many companies have closed or reduced hours across the US to help fight the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the governor said that social distancing was probably an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As of March 28, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York and 672 people had died.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the period of social distancing until April 30.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort docked at the Port of New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, there were 884 deaths from coronavirus within 24 hours in the US.</seg>
<seg id="274">The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring publicly available information by monitoring, through Vice President Mike Pence's office, public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="275">Overall, President Trump's supporters are divided about how well he is handling the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some officials and observers have criticized the US dependence on imports of essential materials, including basic necessities, from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in the journal Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict disease patterns.</seg>
<seg id="278">According to the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.</seg>
<seg id="280">Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On February 7, Australia adopted its new coronavirus contingency plan (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="281">In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and threat communications.</seg>
<seg id="282">On March 21, Australia declared a human biosecurity emergency.</seg>
<seg id="283">Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, which the Chinese authorities authorized.</seg>
<seg id="284">Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their citizens.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan has said it has no intention of evacuating its citizens from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians / relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.</seg>
<seg id="287">Citizens of Poland, China, and India landed in Poland, where the Brazilian plane made a stopover before taking off for Brazil along the route.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens visiting Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near Brasilia.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the US government) were evacuated from Wuhan, taken to Canada's Trenton Air Force Base and quarantined for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="290">On February 11, another plane carrying 185 Canadian citizens, also from Wuhan, landed at CFB Trenton.</seg>
<seg id="291">On February 3 and 4, Australian authorities evacuated 277 of their citizens and placed them in a temporary accommodation centre on Christmas Island, which was converted into a quarantine centre, where they remained for 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South Africans on board.</seg>
<seg id="296">The passengers were medically examined before departure and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans who tested negative for coronavirus were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="298">Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.</seg>
<seg id="299">On March 20, the US began withdrawing some of its troops from Iraq in response to the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 5, China's Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">Some Chinese students at American universities have banded together to collect and send aid to areas of China affected by the virus, with a Chicago-based group reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to clinics in Hubei province on January 30. Humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, together with FedEx, had flown 200,000 medical masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and gowns, to the Wuhan Union clinic by January 30.</seg>
<seg id="302">On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment for coronavirus, as well as to protect populations at risk in Africa and South Asia from the threat of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="303">Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="304">On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.</seg>
<seg id="305">Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia donated more than 13 tons of medicine, Malaysia pledged 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicine, and pledged $100 million in financial support to affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with an outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="307">Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks, and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution to its member states.</seg>
<seg id="308">Later, it also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and five IVL machines to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">Ma also donated medicine to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and test kits.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain has recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which are only 30% accurate, and the Netherlands has recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks, which were supposed to have been manufactured in China but later turned out to have come from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">The WHO commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to control the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="314">The WHO noted clear differences between the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2004, in which Chinese authorities were accused of withholding information that allegedly impeded prevention and containment of the disease, and the current crisis, in which the central government provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Chinese New Year.</seg>
<seg id="315">On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that while "this measure was definitely not recommended by the WHO," it was also "a very important reaffirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at its most widespread location," and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health."</seg>
<seg id="316">WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom said the PHEIC announcement was driven by the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.</seg>
<seg id="317">Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said there was "no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movement and trade," and that "the WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."</seg>
<seg id="318">On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, highlighting the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that do not have systems in place to identify people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries.</seg>
<seg id="319">Mr. Tedros also said that "the indicator of our preparedness is the degree of preparedness for an epidemic of our weakest link," and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest now or pay in the future."</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system in response to the problem."</seg>
<seg id="321">As a result, a UN crisis management team has been created to coordinate all United Nations responses, a move the WHO says will allow it to focus on public health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak more broadly socially and economically.</seg>
<seg id="322">On February 25, the WHO said that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," noting that "it is too early to call it a pandemic, but countries must nonetheless be prepared."</seg>
<seg id="323">When the outbreak broke out in Iran, the WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, the WHO's executive director for health emergencies, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for every government on the planet: it is time to act.</seg>
<seg id="325">The virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, and the right response can help the world avoid the worst-case scenario.</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan also said that current data do not warrant a global pandemic declaration by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus."</seg>
<seg id="327">On March 11, the WHO declared an outbreak of coronavirus a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The WHO's director-general said the WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue."</seg>
<seg id="329">In response to the situation, a petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, proposing his resignation, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.</seg>
<seg id="330">On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respecting everyone's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The expert group stated that everyone has the right to be subjected to life-saving measures, and that it is the responsibility of the government to organize such measures.</seg>
<seg id="332">The Panel emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.</seg>
<seg id="333">The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to solicit views and provide advice.</seg>
<seg id="336">The digital node contains information on country-specific policies (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions, to help countries learn from each other, and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="337">China's government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="338">A number of provincial-level Communist Party of China (CCP) leaders were dismissed for their quarantine measures in central China, and the dismissals reflected dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with an earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">US President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only makes matters worse with a virus that has now become a global pandemic," a remark that has in turn been criticized by some commentators, who argue that this approach is racist and a distraction from the administration's failure to contain the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast obtained access to a US government cable that contained a communications strategic ruse apparently concocted by the National Security Council, with references to the strategy: "It's all about China.</seg>
<seg id="343">Organizations like Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have said China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a "propaganda push" to gain global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has warned of a "geopolitical component, including a struggle for influence through PR and so-called largesse."</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrell also said that "China is pushing hard for its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US."</seg>
<seg id="346">China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by US sanctions imposed on April 3.</seg>
<seg id="348">The US authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own country.</seg>
<seg id="349">Medical masks have also been the subject of disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL machines destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for coronavirus-ridden Italy.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said only China had responded bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch to Italy of Russian military nurses, specialized disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of seeking to impress the world at a "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.</seg>
<seg id="357">Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the US.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American counterparts, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to respond if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="360">NATO's Defender 2020 military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states - the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War - will be conducted in a reduced format.</seg>
<seg id="361">Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticised the Defender 2020 exercise, saying: "In today's public health crisis, the exercise is putting not only the lives of the US military and many European member states at risk, but also those of the countries where it is to be held."</seg>
<seg id="362">On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic because of its lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts had expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="364">South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in government-designated areas.</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators have expressed concern that the move would allow governments to strengthen their powers.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán indefinite powers to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and the government's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages, owing to the global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic buying, and disruptions to production and logistics operations.</seg>
<seg id="370">The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings of shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="371">Panic shopping also occurred in several localities, leading to the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from store shelves, which in turn led to shortages of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.</seg>
<seg id="374">This spike led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays of four to six months in the delivery of medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="375">It has also caused shortages of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, the pandemic gave daigou buyers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.</seg>
<seg id="378">Measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products, which proved successful, averted the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced a significant decline, but the industry believes that agricultural prices could rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">Grocery store shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="381">Similar laws requiring food producers to maintain emergency food supplies exist in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy has taken its toll on China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by the government's anti-virus measures, which resulted in a 20.5% decline in retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, so the viral outbreak is considered a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="384">Agatha Demarai, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential outcomes emerges.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.</seg>
<seg id="386">According to one estimate by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to be taking "urgent action" after oil prices plummeted because of falling demand from China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, global stock markets plunged as the number of people infected with COVID-19 increased significantly outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, amid growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S &amp; P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points - the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="390">By the end of the week, all three indices were down more than 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="391">On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Stocks fell again on concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many believe that there is a chance of an economic recession.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.</seg>
<seg id="395">Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the hardest-hit sectors, with travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government advice not to travel.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result of these measures, numerous airlines have canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.</seg>
<seg id="398">The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season for Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="401">National and regional governments have canceled a number of high-profile events, including annual New Year's Eve festivals; private companies have also closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many New Year's Eve events were cancelled and tourist attractions closed to prevent crowds, such as the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.</seg>
<seg id="403">In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and districts, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="406">Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retailers in North America and the Middle East have cut sales by 50-60%.</seg>
<seg id="408">As a result, shopping mall attendance fell 33% to 43% in March compared to February.</seg>
<seg id="409">The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that a pandemic-induced recession in Latin America could push 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would otherwise have been the case, but without a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.</seg>
<seg id="411">Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="412">The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that a coronavirus outbreak in the United States could put 47 million people out of work, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social security benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany shifted their employees to government-subsidized part-time work.</seg>
<seg id="414">A German part-time wage scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="415">The arts and cultural heritage have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether formally employed or independent, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="416">Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often publicly funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for the public, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and supporting artists wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely or had varying degrees of restricted access, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or rescheduled.</seg>
<seg id="418">Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus has been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry has also suffered setbacks, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome during the last week of the Christian penance period, Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses advise older Christians to stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live, or television, while some church leaders suggest holding open-air services.</seg>

<seg id="423">The pandemic has led to the most significant change in the calendar of global sporting events since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events have been cancelled or rescheduled, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.</seg>
<seg id="425">The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be moved beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.</seg>
<seg id="426">The entertainment industry has also suffered, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their productions.</seg>
<seg id="428">As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore ways to continue and share their work over the Internet, organize live online concerts or web festivals, and help artists continue to perform, produce or publish their work.</seg>
<seg id="429">There are many Internet memes about coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxiety that characterizes periods of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the inception of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as against people in hot spots in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="431">Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.</seg>
<seg id="432">News reports in February (when most of the infections were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups around the world against Chinese citizens who supposedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for something.</seg>
<seg id="433">Anti-Chinese sentiment is also on the rise in some African countries.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.</seg>
<seg id="435">Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, have been supported offline and online.</seg>
<seg id="436">Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signed an early petition urging that Chinese citizens be barred from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (# ChineseNot Coming to Japan) dominated Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racism and even attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change, or therapeutic redirection) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than the one originally envisaged in development.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is one area of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each with several ligand-binding sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADF-ribophosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analyzed their structural similarities to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being investigated in the Solidarity clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="10">The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDC said the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="12">Doctors say they use the drug when there is no other option.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.</seg>
<seg id="14">Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="15">New York University Langone School of Medicine is studying the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is unequivocally effective.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug tested negative after an average of 4 days, while the 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">Controlling production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk and control the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Appropriate workplace risk management depends on the location and task at hand, is based on an assessment of risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that lower-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, incentives for workers to stay home for signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to become infected due to the ongoing spread of the disease in the community or during international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This may include workers who come into contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density workplaces, and some large retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, protective shields, and affordable personal protective equipment in the event of exposure to a person infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers medical and morgue personnel who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection to be at high risk, with the risk increasing to very high when such personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect / process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.</seg>
<seg id="10">The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commercial patterns can change both with respect to the types of goods for which there is demand and the way in which such goods are purchased (for example, shopping during off-peak periods with delivery or servicing without leaving the car).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to organize protection.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and individual workers "risk factors, such as old age or chronic disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also specify the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemic preparedness and response plans can be guided by national or state-level recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of the goals to ensure a response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.</seg>
<seg id="18">Responses are influenced by the severity of disease in the community where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">A hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such controls according to effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the risk of COVID-19 disease cannot be eliminated, the most effective engineering means are safety, followed by administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Safety engineering involves isolating employees from work-related risks and does not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative measures imply changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the worker, appropriate in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly tested, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers the lowest-risk jobs to have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, advice for sick workers to stay home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including covering their mouths with their hands when coughing and sneezing, provision of wipes and garbage cans, preparedness for remote or shift work if necessary, advice for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rapidly identifying and isolating potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, fever, and many other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever suppressants or other symptom-relieving drugs, as well as requiring flexibility in sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that employees are aware of such policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, but who are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community where the business is located or recent travel to COVID-19 locations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Administrative measures for this and higher-risk groups include advising sick workers to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, setting shift schedules, stopping non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to answer worker concerns, providing relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protective measures, training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, ensuring proper use of such equipment, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting access to the workplace by customers and the public, and placing information signs on the need for hand washing and other COVID-protective measures.</seg>
<seg id="31">In rare cases, workers at risk may need to wear respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">If a person falls ill on an airplane, measures such as isolating the sick person from others within 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person, providing the sick person with a mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are necessary to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Non-essential crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when coming into contact with bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, a regular cough, or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing a medical center on board if there is heat or other symptoms on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">When there is minimal or moderate infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling trips for face-to-face meetings, gatherings, and other public events, such as physical exercise or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate location for health facilities for children with flu symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">At a significant rate of prevalence in the community, long-term absenteeism may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">Law enforcement officials who are required to come into contact with people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">If close contact occurs during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse with household cleaning sprays or wipes, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, and use and wash clothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA considers certain categories of health-care and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="42">They have a very high risk of infection when they perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect / process samples from individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures involving aerosol formation include probing, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk morgue workers include those who handle the bodies of people with a confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of death; if they perform an autopsy, they are classified as very high risk. Additional engineering safety features for such risk groups include the use of segregated facilities for patients with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including for aerosol-producing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be handled in accordance with biosafety level 3 precautions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the US, NIOSH-approved face masks with an N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">The WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only for personnel performing screening at the point of admission.</seg>
<seg id="51">For those collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without aerosol treatments, the WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective goggles or face shield, a bathrobe and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">For procedures involving the formation of an aerosol, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using telemedicine capabilities, physical barriers such as so-called transparent windows, ensuring access to a COVID-19-infected patient only by direct caregivers, using only those personal protective equipment needed for a specific task, prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, when working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending that masks not be used for those without symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million cases worldwide</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of the coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease spreads to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mostly spread through close contact between people, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing, or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can spread both before symptoms appear and at later stages.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of the disease, as well as for their caregivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the public vary, with some agencies recommending that they not be used at all, some recommending their use, and others requiring it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="15">Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Acute symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or a feeling of stiffness, confusion, difficulty waking, blue face or lips; if these symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.</seg>
<seg id="18">Less common are symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are also gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in different percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of the cases reported in China initially showed only chest compression and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and eventually death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection. Evidence suggests that not all infected people develop symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of such asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="27">China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can have high concentrations of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">When speaking loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when speaking at normal volume.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that when coughing open, droplets can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) away.</seg>
<seg id="31">The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and testing of air treated by air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; it can spread before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.</seg>
<seg id="34">Officials at the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) say it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the virus was found to live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soaps and detergents, when used properly, have a fairly useful effect on infection control: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can also remove it from skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="39">In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest level of the virus in the blood on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="42">Once outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (ash meter).</seg>
<seg id="45">Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial lesion, which is more common in severe cases.</seg>
<seg id="46">The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbances observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they are involved in the work of this organ.</seg>
<seg id="48">A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 is tropic to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells were found to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrates.</seg>
<seg id="52">The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard testing method.</seg>
<seg id="54">The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples taken from the nasopharynx, but a nasal swab or sputum sample can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results are usually ready within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks, and the results are not directly relevant.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of current infection, as well as possible past infection, were under development but not yet widely available.</seg>
<seg id="59">China's experience with these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use later this month.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral multi-lateral subpleural compaction foci, like matt glass, with peripheral, asymmetric, and posteriory distribution, are common symptoms detected early in the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone cobblestone (a lobular thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy are:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema</seg>
<seg id="66">There are four types of viral pneumonia severity:</seg>
<seg id="67">mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multi-nuclear giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS); leukoerythroblastic response</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, respecting respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="74">After coughing or sneezing, good hand hygiene is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.</seg>
<seg id="76">Distance guidelines also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19, and with vaccine development not expected to be completed until 2021 at the earliest, much of the action against the spread of COVID-19 is focused on reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the "plateau."</seg>
<seg id="78">The CDC also recommends washing your hands more frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating and after shriveling, coughing, or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">The CDC also recommends the use of hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol content), but only when soap and water are not available.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable antiseptic treatment for hands.</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a moisturiser.</seg>
<seg id="83">Patients are given maintenance therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">To strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the US, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care settings, when performing procedures that may involve airborne discharge, such as intubation or hand drying.</seg>
<seg id="92">The CDC has issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="93">The recommended personal protective equipment is a protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, respirators are preferable to medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used without instructions, effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="96">If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, at the very least, making masks yourself at home.</seg>
<seg id="97">In most cases, COVID-19 is not severe enough to require artificial lung ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is currently under active investigation, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or a two-level positive airway pressure.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not yet known whether either of these two treatments is as effective for critically ill patients as IVL.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, because this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe illness for the elderly (those over 60, and especially those over 80) is much higher.</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and health-care system resources are too limited to cope with the surge in severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">One study in China found that 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, roughly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="104">The task of providing artificial ventilation to the lungs is becoming more difficult as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation become increasingly problematic.</seg>
<seg id="105">Inhalation-supported IVLs and VACs are needed to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage that can lead to pneumothorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">On earlier fan models, a high VAC may not be available.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.</seg>
<seg id="109">New drug development could take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="111">WHO-recommended volunteers are taking part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.</seg>
<seg id="112">Its use has not been subject to clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">To log in, users must enter their name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="119">Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for those who may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregate data on the location of cellular subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said mobile network operators reported that 40% of people were still moving around anyway.</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government ran a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kirsti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and the economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and wellbeing."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease can be mild, with little or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Mild patients usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical patients can take three to six weeks to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="129">Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although no such data are available for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.</seg>
<seg id="132">Abnormalities of thrombosis, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while kidney dysfunction was observed in 4% of this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five patients were hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to early-stage case studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study conducted by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological studies of posthumous lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.</seg>
<seg id="140">The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8% of the deaths recorded by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in the region can also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of mortality by condition vary because of such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">Inadequate counting of mild cases can lead to an overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.</seg>
<seg id="147">One Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20 to 30%, and their scans revealed damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">Once recovered, it can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who recovered from the virus developed resistance to it.</seg>
<seg id="150">Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where coronavirus tests have been positive after recovery from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="151">In these cases, it is believed that there was an acute protracted course of the disease, rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is believed to be natural, of animal origin and an infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="154">A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019, the earliest date for the first case.</seg>
<seg id="155">According to official figures released by the WHO, the date is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">All figures vary by region and time of transmission, and are also influenced by testing volumes, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the disease the ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822 / 2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who die as a result of the disease, and determining the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die as a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to know how many people have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="163">At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are dead.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.</seg>
<seg id="165">Moreover, Germany's health-care system was not overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, based on blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="167">COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies in China and Italy, mortality rates are higher for men.</seg>
<seg id="170">The most at-risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women only narrows from the age of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-specific immunological differences, lower smoking rates among women, and co-morbidity in men (for example, hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) may be responsible for higher mortality among men.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were among men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="176">Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ARVI have different gender statistics.</seg>
<seg id="177">The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are therefore more likely to contract the disease.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Ghebreyesus, explains: "CO stands for" crown, "" VI "virus," "D" disease, "and the year 19 when the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In public statements, the WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19."</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the WHO recommended using the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidelines for the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.</seg>
<seg id="186">Because of volume constraints in standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nasal swab swabs and parts of IVL machines.</seg>
<seg id="187">In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it on time, so a local manufacturing facility was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">Since the COVID-19 outbreak first broke out, various conspiracy theories, disinformation, and fake information about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the virus have proliferated rapidly on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">Studies have not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks, and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.</seg>
<seg id="192">Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the research builds on previous SARS-CoV studies.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three vaccination strategies.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response by the human body to a new infection, COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain sub-units of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-thorn protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">A third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine-making technique).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.</seg>
<seg id="205">Drugs approved to treat malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Antiviral reprofiling accounts for the majority of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, preliminary data on the efficacy of Remdesivir are available.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir as an exception.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China, and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.</seg>
<seg id="211">Nevertheless, there is a need for peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling that dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">Nitazoxanide has been recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 penetration through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires assimilation of the thorn protein with serin 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2).</seg>
<seg id="217">Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in COVID-19 treatment is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinetic properties.</seg>
<seg id="220">The drug has entered the second phase of a non-randomized trial, which is being conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results were obtained in patients with a severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combined with serum testing for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="224">Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy has been tried in treating patients with SARS, but the results have been inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="226">Neutralizing the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis, may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.</seg>
<seg id="229">Reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, could be scaled up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia limit the number of packs of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packs of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all stores across the country to two and one packs, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.</seg>
<seg id="4">The restrictions were announced in announcements at the box office and on the network's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">Citizens reportedly began stockpiling emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to a general self-isolation regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, the Woolworths chain also limited the amount of toilet paper it buys to one pack.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited that number to 4 packs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Retailer Coles said in a March 8 press release that with the introduction of a four-pack limit in many stores, toilet paper was still being sold too quickly - one delivery within an hour - and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called the trend "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Woolworths spokesman said there had been a surge in sales last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Costco store in Canberra last week also limited the number to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered more batches, while ALDI stocked up for a special early-sale promotion on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish inventories, but this was hampered by local government restrictions on truck timetables.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and fewer profitable offers are available.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were unable to hold promotions on Wednesday because of depleted inventories.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report to news.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenished stocks every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that toilet paper is bulky, so stock levels are low, and long rows of shelves remain empty after the sale of the entire stock, adding to the sense of stock shortages.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and items like rolls of toilet paper and hand sanitizers could be placed on those shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn't panic so much," Russell Zimmerman said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last Wednesday, the maker of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported running out of stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex toilet paper and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure there were enough products.</seg>
<seg id="20">Domain.com, the property website, said that when Melbourne's auction numbers fell due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day week, some property sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thursday's edition of the Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to an ABC Australia report on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose limits on the number of items they could buy, saying they had no plans to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, British supermarket Ocado's online store was also seen on Sunday evening restricting the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.</seg>

<seg id="3">THEME: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">DATE / TIME: March 14, 2020, 00: 24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">SOLUTIONS: CC0: No protected rights</seg>
<seg id="6">This month, we are living in unusual circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shone a light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our interventions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate, and develop communities around the world that underpin such an organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have seen the camaraderie and care among all of our colleagues reflected in emails, calls and chats - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, I received a commendation for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it is possible because of your work, whether to keep sites running, pay our colleagues, or protect the safety of communities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever.</seg>
<seg id="15">At a time like this, it is not just what we do, but how we do it, that matters if we are to achieve meaningful results for the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together starting next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjustment of our operating procedures and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robin previously said, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the course of the conversation, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vast majority of us wanted to de-stress and support our long-term mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to back off, so be it.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all staff, contractors and freelancers:</seg>
<seg id="23">We expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are issued.</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not declare days off: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, be it caring for loved ones, buying groceries, or going to the doctor, your wellbeing is our number one priority.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not monitor your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you get sick, you shouldn't work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.</seg>
<seg id="29">No sick leave or compensatory time off is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, tell Brian from T &amp; C Ops so that T &amp; C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)</seg>
<seg id="31">Hourly rates will be paid in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already announced and confirm our intention to honor our obligations to our contractors and hourly employees.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">This includes periods of illness when you are unable to work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do can produce amazing results, especially at times like these.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, it is about self-help.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some jobs are considered essential.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must always support such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and refocus on providing the support that is critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to work twice as hard to catch up once the pandemic is over.</seg>
<seg id="47">You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.</seg>
<seg id="48">We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables where possible.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens to APP (annual plans)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.</seg>
<seg id="51">We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thereby allowing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-help, and care, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work is provided with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tension throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this effort.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office Condition, Risks, and Cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues may have been infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in addition to many precautions, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator lobbies through which access to our floor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="59">The building has its own precautionary rules, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located on WeWork's network, which has shared its COVID-19 rules with us and all DC-based staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last week, our office in the District of Columbia went completely offline, as instructed by San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting space in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into a course of several days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send the materials in advance for review.</seg>
<seg id="70">By default, use video communication, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.</seg>
<seg id="71">For ease of reference, appoint a facilitator - a person who will track the flow of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as a person responsible for keeping notes (or joint notes).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a convenient headset, contact technical support via e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="73">Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the # remoties channel at Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote distributed work efficiency across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass Wikimedia-funded events such as Editathons until the WHO declares the pandemic over.</seg>
<seg id="77">We understand and advise that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for involuntary delays or changes in such objectives.</seg>
<seg id="78">Next week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.</seg>
<seg id="79">The general mood in the global community is not only sadness at the interruption, but also some sense of relief at understanding and being able to focus on one's own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="80">Looking ahead, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a space for the community to monitor impact and communication.</seg>
<seg id="81">We remain in touch on COVID-19 issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.</seg>
<seg id="83">This time, we will take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time connecting with each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are together in this situation and ready to help in whatever way we can.</seg>
<seg id="85">However, you can still receive information from such e-mails and other important COVID-19 information from Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">The CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, lighting issues, or other assistance, please contact the CRT.</seg>
<seg id="89">We stand ready to provide support and liaison as needed.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have privacy concerns, email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">No such change should be seen as a repudiation of our work and our commitments.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and enable us to continue our work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.</seg>
<seg id="96">For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as hard as you can when the need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).</seg>

<seg id="1">Diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which summarizes our experience and provides well-calibrated recommendations to fight the pandemic worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," according to the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19 (Version 7) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">The publication attracted a lot of attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), were issued, with some of its provisions changing substantially.</seg>
<seg id="11">A recent paper by Zhou and co-authors commented on our recommendations, offering simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">This work has added new empirical evidence to our recommendations, as well as providing valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We reaffirm the high value of their work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to the latest Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial Version 7) and current studies, their work needs updating.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when a case of suspected disease is confirmed, it is necessary to combine one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in and around Wuhan or other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms reported within 2 weeks in small areas such as a house or apartment, office, classroom at school, etc.)</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes in the early stages of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="18">Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or a titer increase of at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may also be noted that the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of the document added a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in Issues 4 (January 27, 2020) and 5 (February 8, 2020); and then in Issue 7, the need for serological proof was added.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood samples, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in disease confirmation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, there is growing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without severe symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, the roadmap presented in Zhou et al. "s paper should be updated, because it classifies people without clinical symptoms as a" low-risk "group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The evaluation system also needs to be refined for further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we hope for more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">When it comes to diagnosing "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we encourage readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest advice in the countries where they live.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19 day high</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said the reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dr Mirjabi said two of the dead were aged over 60, two were aged between 51 and 60, and one was aged between 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said two of the dead were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="10">A clinic official told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Meitri clinic.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Public transport has been suspended since March 26 and was due to resume on Saturday, April 4.</seg>
<seg id="13">The transport of essential goods, such as medicine, fuel and food, was still allowed.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of March 19, the three people had recovered.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the term "pandemic" describes only the extent of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, the WHO notes that national governments need to take action:</seg>
<seg id="4">Together, all countries are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is possible if countries identify, test, treat, isolate, track cases, and mobilize their citizens, "explained WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom Ghebreyesus.</seg>
<seg id="6">We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no respiratory virus other than influenza has ever been tracked from its inception to its continued global spread."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then reclassified it as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."</seg>
<seg id="13">As of Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, and more than 4,600 people had died, according to the Associated Press.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory testing of the 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific and designed only to detect RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in hospital, or none at all.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact mortality rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of March 2020, because of limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">By March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the help of real-time polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various means, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are usually available within a period of several hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The OT-PCR test, carried out on swabs taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later, the virus can disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, lower respiratory tract material can be extracted using a suction catheter, or sputum can be used as an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.</seg>
<seg id="19">One in three genetic tests from older versions of test kits yielded incomplete results because of faulty reagents and a narrow testing area run by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency authorization, and US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics began testing COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing of tests must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).</seg>
<seg id="26">On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a COVID-19 test. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be performed for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has also approved a test that uses amplification technology for isothermal nucleic acids instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, the method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 review of specialist literature concluded that chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results can have such value even before symptoms appear.</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical signs identified by CT scans include bilateral multilongitudinal subpleural compaction foci, like matt glass, with peripheral, asymmetric, and posteriory distributions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subpleural dominance, cobblestone symptom, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, because many of its imaging functions overlap with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that CT scans not be used for screening or as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnostics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to conduct population control.</seg>
<seg id="39">In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.</seg>
<seg id="40">CLT typically uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="41">In PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike PCR methods, blood sampling is not required for a test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency approval test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that can fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="44">The performance of the test is several hundred samples in a few hours, and therefore the method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of having the virus to stay at home: emergency room staff give the patient a test tube for a sample, the patient spits in it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results.</seg>
<seg id="47">Rapid testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures of any country. In Germany, on March 2, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced that it was willing to perform about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, compared to just 10,700 tests per week a week a week earlier.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Institute's president, Robert Koch, Germany's total testing capacity is 160,000 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, rapid testing was being proposed in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="52">Researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of samples from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample tested positive. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called Huo Yan (in Chinese), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">Built by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just five days, the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, there would have been 47% more cases in Hubei, and quarantine costs would have been twice as high.</seg>
<seg id="54">Following the opening of the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 Chinese cities.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits have been released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 tubes.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States had become problematic, owing to shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents.</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that heat samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates currently has more coronavirus testing per capita than any other country, and that most of the population will soon be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was due to rapid testing capabilities, together with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI of a mass population testing laboratory (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">Deployed in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, resulting in a lack of test kits in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">But in South Korea, experts say the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">For several years, South Korea's government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for more testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">The US test kits developed by the CDC had "shortcomings," so the government removed bureaucratic barriers that impeded private test development.</seg>
<seg id="68">The firm explained that the inaccuracy of the results could be due to poor sampling or improper use of the kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said it would recall sets that produced inaccurate results and replace them with other sets from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovic proposed dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health claimed that test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the ministry "did not use them."</seg>
<seg id="71">Quarantine measures for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as follow-up of people with whom such patients came into contact, had positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where the first person in Italy died of COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people at intervals of about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">The entrance to the community was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="75">With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops were not imposed.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many events there were canceled, and Singapore began urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools, which ended on March 23, reopened as scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">Seven of the 16 control laboratories are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following chart, the percentage of positive results column depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapidly rising cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Given Italy's experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to currently available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority recovering.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% become critical when intensive care is required.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">This study analyzes trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom, and compares them with trends in Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and the UK with data for Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world at the same pace as China's.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the March 5, 2020 issue of the journal Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the WHO criteria for determining the presence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020, with all three cases returning from Wuhan in China's Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infections had been identified in all 30 EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between December 31, 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, occurred in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Determining cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8 a.m. the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as their ministries of health, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data are used to analyze trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with data for Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">Trends in COVID-19 truncated cumulative morbidity over a 14-day period in EU / EEA countries and the UK were broadly consistent with those observed in Hubei Province of China (Fig. 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, with a spike on February 28, 2020 (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU / EEA countries and the UK experienced similar trends in cumulative COVID-19 (supplementary material) cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8 a.m. on March 15 in 15 other EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">Observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is despite different stages in different countries, different national public health responses, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including catch-up testing.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already at full capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">Currently, data on admissions of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and / or intensive care units in the EU / EEA are available for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not provided).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, such data need to be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data, which focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to a 2010-2011 study, there is a wide variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment Report on COVID-19 presents scenarios for health system resource utilization, with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected people in each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom when the risk of a shortage of available intensive care beds exceeds 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases are currently grouped into certain EU / EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a specific territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units (NUTS-2) Level 2 units.</seg>
<seg id="39">Italy's experience and current trends elsewhere show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="40">Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must therefore be prepared for a scenario of long-term exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reported in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment Report, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach, followed by a shift from containment to minimization, is essential to containing the spread of SARS-COV-2, because, given the projected rapid increase in disease, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, adopt, and adjust their responses if such measures are not taken in advance.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Rapid Risk Assessment Report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Countries have only a short period of time in which to intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">If this is not done, health systems in other EU / EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening a human coronavirus can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome II (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 brought renewed attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogenicity of the virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="6">A human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origins will be very useful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defining animal carriers has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interactions of animals that carry coronaviruses could also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origins and modes of interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is considered in this context.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the conditions necessary for successful carrier change and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with a single positive-polar strand of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses, with the largest RNA-containing virus genome, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open overlapping reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins replicating pp1a and pp1ab.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are then processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spiked protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Other coronavirus lines also encode a number of linespecific accessory proteins.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-coronaviruses), with beta-coronaviruses comprising most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="24">For millennia, coronaviruses have consistently crossed interspecies barriers, and some have evolved into pathogens that are dangerous to humans.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="28">Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and developing extra-pulmonary symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample taken from the nasopharynx of patients with colds in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, extensive research has gained more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it was generally accepted that human coronavirus infection was generally harmless.</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in modern history; more than 8,000 people were sickened, and the overall death rate was about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has since been renamed SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the current 2019 epidemic of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has been raised, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic, originating from bats, mice, or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses are well adapted and do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but exhibit wide genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has presented China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge.</seg>
<seg id="40">Research into the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will provide insights into their natural history, the drivers of their evolution, and the constraints on interspecies transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">It may also prompt or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying medium for SARS-CoV-2, which is essential to prevent the disease from respreading in the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">This review provides an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originate are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also analyze the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.</seg>
<seg id="45">The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is considered in the same context.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first derived from a sample taken from the nasopharynx of patients with colds, different coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="49">Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative summary of the history of human coronaviruses in chronological order.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus has since adapted to multiply in WI-38 lung cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and coughing occurring in 10-20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of suction mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are ubiquitous around the world, and are usually transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="55">The incubation period for these two viruses generally lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with weakened immune systems showed severe lower respiratory tract infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemic, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the pathogen was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">Excluding hyper-active distributors, it was estimated that each case could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load occurred on day 10 of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise, and chills, while later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="63">Common laboratory deviations from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples, and elevated levels of creatinkinase.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage levels.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In such severe cases, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research into human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="70">At first, it was found to mainly affect young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised immune systems and respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with its peak occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 has been associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as cereals.</seg>
<seg id="76">HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to non-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been linked to the exacerbation of asthma.</seg>
<seg id="78">Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been identified worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, though incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">These human coronaviruses usually become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to transmit and survive effectively in the human body.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but several European countries and Tunisia have recorded imported cases and spread through sporadic secondary infections through close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with both infections characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">Between mid-December and the end of December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which, looking back, is now associated with an infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health emergency, and the disease has been dubbed "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It should be noted that the death rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2%, and outside the country it is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, coughing and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also have diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nonetheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a higher transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the virus's ability to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of disease.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there are also interesting patterns common to both human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e., infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmittance, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after passage through humans.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four human coronaviruses, which cause non-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">On the other hand, it may be humans that have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.</seg>
<seg id="114">Human coronaviruses, which cause severe illness in humans, and human coronaviruses, which cause severe illness, simply did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate sufficiently in the human body to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier constraints.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four non-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.</seg>
<seg id="120">The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to conserve and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has traits similar to both SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the four non-hospital HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">But it is more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate host animal.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV viruses, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="127">An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="128">The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.</seg>
<seg id="129">Likewise, the reservoir carrier permanently transports HCoV over a long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">By contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate rapidly and then transmit it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can carry a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.</seg>
<seg id="134">By contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate carriers and even establish long-term endemicity.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir medium.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and hunting animals (game).</seg>
<seg id="137">Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traders have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoons in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all citations in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, it has been reported that Himalayan civets living in the wild or on farms that were not marketed did not have SARS-CoV in most cases, suggesting that Himalayan civets could serve only as an intermediate reinforcing agent, not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">Remarkably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate reinforcing carriers cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="142">All appear to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent search for the natural host animal SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, which has been named SARS-related horseshoe bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except for one, which stands for WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</seg>
<seg id="149">WIV1, derived from bat faeces, has been shown to use ACE2 in bats, citrus, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, serums from convalescent patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">Today, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Philogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.</seg>
<seg id="154">CoV-HKU4 in bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.</seg>
<seg id="155">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to sequences from bat beta-coronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25 bats, matches only 87%.</seg>
<seg id="158">That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-hump camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of single-humped camels, further confirming the camels "role as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed mild symptoms but massive viral outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="162">Remarkably, infected camels excreted the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of excretion in bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">Questions remain, however, because many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have no history of contact with camels prior to symptoms and are plausible for human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels, including unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% consistent with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe-bearing Rhinolophus affinis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be attributed to parental relationships.</seg>
<seg id="166">That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the direct animals carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a probable case of animal-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent beta-coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.</seg>
<seg id="171">They cluster into two sublines of virus differentiation, such as SARS-CoV-2, in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RDD) closer to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.</seg>
<seg id="172">By contrast, the RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the identification of viral contigues in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to sequence the genome, comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">The possibility that the pangolin became one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="179">Whereas the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="180">Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between beta-coronaviruses of pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.</seg>
<seg id="181">The opposite proposal advocates a recombination between the pangolin beta-coronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also being studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can come from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in a North American tricolor sucker, was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was found in Ghana, although it was suspected that camels could also be its intermediate carrier.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.</seg>
<seg id="190">When interspecies transmission of HCoV-OC43 occurred around 1890 and humans became infected from domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Bat alpha-coronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between them lies the alpaca alpha coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="194">Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">At the same time, humans are in close contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, bat alpha-coronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronavirus caused a respiratory attack in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alpaca alpha-coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thus, the possibility that alpacas received an alpha-coronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">So it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while bat alpha-coronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-humped camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as MERS-CoV did.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-humped camels and from single-humped camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.</seg>
<seg id="205">Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for inter-species gene exchange and inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats ideal propagators.</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-humped camels decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="208">He adapted well to these camels, which went from intermediate carrier to stable and natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="209">In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild illness and has a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV because its transmission is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike camels "role in MERS-CoV transmission, pangolins" role, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be dead-end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">Future studies need to confirm or rule out several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcing carriers into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.</seg>
<seg id="218">People contract the virus through cutting carcasses and eating wild meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">Screening domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to the different types of animal carriers, three major factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high," with an average replacement rate of about 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high rates of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the frequency of coronaviruses mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.</seg>
<seg id="230">Moreover, the mutation rate can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Presumably, the virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to lose their effectiveness quickly as a result of genetic drift.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution that is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under the right conditions.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is facilitated by numerous unique open-source reading frameworks and protein functions encoded in the 3 '-end direction of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier that serves as the mixing vessel, the strands are often switched.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homogeneous full-size and sub-genomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-carrier interaction in relation to transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor for inter-species transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.</seg>
<seg id="243">In this paper, the SARS-CoV recombination is cited as a typical example that also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis between human and cyvete SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations in the RSD of the S. protein.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RSD of the S coronavirus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the host antibody's response intensively selects it.</seg>
<seg id="246">SARS-CoV is an amino acid, 318 to 510, on a fragment of S1 that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="247">SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing APF2 receptors in different animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoons, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which are different from human viral strains and civets, four of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">SARS-CoV civets have mutations of K479N and S487T in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spiked protein's interaction with the human APF2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the S protein means that the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study using a cryo-electron microscope says that the affinity of this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between a person's APF2 and the SARS-CoV protein S.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S. protein.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also controlled by other factors of carrier dependency and limitation.</seg>
<seg id="259">Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-humped camels, and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">Successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses requires usurping dependency factors and subordinating carrier restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and carrier still need to be defined and categorized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Impartial full-genome screening of dependency factors and carrier restriction for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology could yield good results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The Emergence of New HCoVs: Back to Zero</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates significant opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">Moreover, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in the process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, because bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, the 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.</seg>
<seg id="270">This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombination localizations were also identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to undergo recombinant events between different lines, as occurred in single-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoV, in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of freeing the virus from selection pressures, such as from the host's immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in a prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to bi-nucleotide division.</seg>
<seg id="277">Whereas an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-coronavirus exhibits a single nucleotide insert, resulting in a frame shift.</seg>
<seg id="278">Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures on their reservoir carriers.</seg>
<seg id="279">When bats were infected with coronaviruses, mild or no symptoms were recorded, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.</seg>
<seg id="280">Bats were found to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, defective activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces pathology caused by coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apagulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2 / CD94 and the low expression of molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high levels of active oxygen provided by the high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit coronavirus replication, while affecting exoribonuclease readings, thus creating selection pressures to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">So it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They confidently replicate without triggering a strong immune response in the host.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">By contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of untying the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.</seg>
<seg id="293">Thus, taking interferon type I, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma is impaired in bats.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern that gave rise to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="297">While a bat beta-coronavirus has been found whose nucleotide homology is 95% identical to SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology is 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">The pangolin beta-coronaviruses were found to be strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as an intermediate carrier, or that fragments of the pangolin beta-coronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.</seg>
<seg id="301">Coronaviruses have attracted global attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">Studies of coronaviruses in bats and other animals have radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoirs in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">Strong evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.</seg>
<seg id="304">If SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-human contact in markets, the closure of game markets and the eradication of citrus in them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of pangolin beta-coronaviruses, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains a challenge for future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are an important means of transport, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge that cause outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate around the world.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and / or more lethal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">To reduce unnecessary human-animal contact, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the harsh tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be conquered.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although many bat properties are conducive to the spread of viruses, if humans are taught to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.</seg>
<seg id="321">A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires ongoing mammalian epidemiological surveillance, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses and future disease outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">The zoonotic conundrum of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some pieces.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate carrier, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.</seg>
<seg id="329">Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
