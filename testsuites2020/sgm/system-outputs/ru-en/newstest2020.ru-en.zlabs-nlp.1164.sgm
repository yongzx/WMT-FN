<seg id="1">COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the context of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20 years, i.e. to identify individuals (“contacts”), which could communicate with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">Many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed in some regions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several applications for tracking contacts have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This has created a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Milder options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the proximity of the user to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020 Google and Apple announced that they will unite their efforts to integrate the functionality of support for such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.</seg>
<seg id="9">The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona!” application, working on Bluetooth, helping to monitor contacts with potentially infected people and providing operational communication with health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the application was expected to be registered in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 April, the Government stated that the annex to monitor contacts was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering using the Singapore TraceTogether applications and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application with the function of geosonization, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19, living in Moscow, do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a security professor, University of Cambridge, denotes a number of potential practical problems that may arise with systems based on applications, including false triggers and potential inefficiency in the event of a small part of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Taking into account the concern about the misleading or harmful “Konovirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus applications in the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations in this list.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Privacy Protection Campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronary-related applications; in particular, the question of whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of oversight.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Monitoring should be “legitimate, necessary and proportionate”;</seg>
<seg id="21">Increased monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by a limitation clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19 proliferation;</seg>
<seg id="23">Security and anonymity of data should be protected and proof of such security should be provided;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital observation should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;</seg>
<seg id="26">Protection against abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, should be guaranteed;</seg>
<seg id="27">The “significant participation” of all “relevant stakeholders”, including public health experts and marginalized groups, should be ensured. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google and Apple offer their joint plan to solve the problem of constant observation, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices, as soon as the need disappears.</seg>
<seg id="29">In some countries, network tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to download the application and the ability to avoid tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that have access to source data also have great potential confidentiality problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with central servers should have access to location personal data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality that use central servers only for communication (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system using applications as a basis was used to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a special application, the system collected information on tracing from various sources, including mobile device traceability and card transactions, and then combining them to create notifications in the form of text messages that have been sent to potentially infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Government had not only used this information to prevent citizens from potential contacts with infected persons, but had also made information on the location of the publicly available, which had been made possible by significant legislative changes that had been made since the outbreak of MERS in that country.</seg>
<seg id="36">Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and systems that retain confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been made public.</seg>
<seg id="38">Monitoring of contacts in which confidentiality is maintained is a well-established concept, a significant amount of research literature dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on decisions that ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized trace with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">These protocols are responsible for identifying the personal data that have never left the device and all comparisons occur on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in the collection and use of data on location or intersection of paths to track COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work of this platform is based on the studies given in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic”, published in March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without jeopardizing the privacy of these data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCN, the aim of which is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and alerting, is the groups separating the same approach and using similar protocols, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.</seg>
<seg id="45">On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020 Google and Apple, companies that control the operation of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to monitor contacts, which they claimed will ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish formal applications to monitor the movement of infected coronavirus citizens, but with the confidentiality of data</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant observation, first introducing the system through the updates of the operating system, and then removing it in the same way after the end of the threat.</seg>

<seg id="1">The washing of hands, also known as the “gig hygiene of hands”, is the process of purification of hands to remove contamination, fat, microorganisms or other malicious substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted in a faecal and oral way.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person can also get infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or ordinary cold, for example, if touched the eyes, nose or mercury (i.e. mucous membranes) are intact hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five critical moments during the day, after which we should wash hands with soap: before and after defecation, after changing the buttocks of the child or changing the diapers, before feeding the child, before food, as well as before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If water and soap are inaccessible, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends that hands be washed:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after cooking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after the care procedures for the sick person.</seg>
<seg id="8">After a change of diapers or substitution of the child who went to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The basic medical objective of washing hands is to clean up hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing diseases), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This procedure is particularly important for people who are engaged in cooking or work in the medical sphere, but it is also important for all other people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Washing hands is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious species of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,</seg>
<seg id="16">It also reduces infant mortality in childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a small acceleration of children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, the infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by assimilating simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This elementary procedure can reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regular reminders of the benefits of washing can reduce the number of diarrhoea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of low-income regions with low water.</seg>
<seg id="21">Reducing the number of diarrhoea cases by 48% can be associated with the washing of hands with soap. The washing of hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ORS) provided that appropriate habits in each house are developed, in schools and other public places around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of mortality among children under the age of five, which takes about 1.8 million children per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Almost 3.5 million children die every year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before food and after a toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce mortality from diarrhoea almost twice, and mortality from acute respiratory infections – a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hands are usually combined with other health interventions in water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).</seg>
<seg id="26">Washing hands also prevents impetite – diseases that are transmitted in direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">A small negative consequence of the frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to the drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 2012 Danish study showed that too often we could lead to disoning and skin peeling – to a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of hands, which is particularly common among health workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Too frequent washing of hands can also be considered one of the symptoms of reculsive-compulsive disorder (RKR).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of faecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (money, defecation), after changing the buttocks of the child (change of diapers), before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some other cases where we should wash hands in order to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after treatment or wound, after cleaning, cough or shrimp, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, the hand washing procedure with soap is quite common.</seg>
<seg id="33">A study on the washing of hands, which was carried out in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that on average 38.7% of families washing hands with soap – it is a common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest indicator, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States is closer to the middle by the middle, and its rate is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China - 23%. Currently there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing at schoolchildren at the time of the day is one such method that helps to teach children to such a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Emergency Medical Care Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen child health and improve the education of children.</seg>
<seg id="35">This national program is based on deworming, which is held twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily cleaning of teeth with fluorine.</seg>
<seg id="36">The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removal of micro-organisms with skin cover occurs more effectively if we are added soap or detergents during washing.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water itself is not considered an effective means of purifying skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the process of cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to reusable application, can also contain bacteria that can be accessed to it under the previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies on the skin cover of the bacteria with a contaminated piece of solid soap speaks about the low probability of such hit, as the bacteria are washed with foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Central Committee still argues that “the live soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for washing hands”.</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has an electoral impact on organisms that have antibiotic resistance in nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as tryclosis, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not correspond to advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surface-active and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (insuce, ascorbial, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active gasoline acid and other pillows (alloe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis, carried out by the University of Oregon School of Public Health, showed that in terms of disease prevention and bacteria removal of hands, simple varieties of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing tryclosis.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water is comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, in order to remove natural fats that hold pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more efficient than cold.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial loads on hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">The disinfectant for hands (sanitary) or antiseptic for hand is a means of hygiene of hands that do not contain water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, it was necessary to gain popularity for the hygiene of hands on a alcoholic basis, which did not contain water (also known as disinfectants for hands on a alcoholic basis, anti-Septic means for disinfection of hands or sanitasis).</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these means are manufactured on the basis of propylene alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in the form of gel, or moisturizing, such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, providing convenience to the use of these tools and reducing the effect of drying the skin alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding the diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95% of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinosvirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Disinfectants containing 70% of alcohol, kill 99.97% of bacteria (logifier of reduction of 3.5 similar to reduction of 35 decibel) in hands after 30 seconds after application and 9999% – 99.99% of bacteria (logist of reduction 4–5) on hands in 1 minute after application. Disinfectants for hands are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis are virtually ineffective against the viruses of aruvirus (or Norwalk) type, the most frequent cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient number of anti-Septic or alcohol-containing means should be used to thoroughly process and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="60">The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length of the vegetation for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fingerprints on both hands should also be thoroughly rinsed. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that we choose hands and not use disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily polluted.</seg>
<seg id="62">The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for a full-fledged hand washing, if it is possible to use water and soap.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of disinfectants for hands on a alcoholic basis can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and (or) moisturizing skin.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effect of drying the skin alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other softening substances to the means.</seg>
<seg id="65">When clinical trials, disinfectants for hands on a alcoholic basis containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact strangers syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants do not occur practically.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants compared to soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Despite its effectiveness, the means that do not contain water do not purify their hands from organic substances, but simply disintegrate them.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is for this reason that disinfectants are not so effective in terms of preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms, as ordinary soap and water, as pathogenic micro-organisms still remain in their hands when using such means.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficiency of the disinfectant for hands, which does not contain alcohol, depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than alcohol or alcohol-containing means.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, it has been proven that the drugs using chloride of petrol have a rack and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford so much and replace it with ash or clay.</seg>
<seg id="73">Zola or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, as in contact with water forms an alkaline solution.</seg>
<seg id="76">If soap is not available, as an alternative, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand.</seg>
<seg id="77">To prevent contamination of Disease Control Centres in the U.S. recommend the use of hand washing techniques, including the following stages:</seg>
<seg id="78">Spin the hands under warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the water temperature does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="80">Write your hands, growing them with a lot of soap, including the rear side of the palms, as well as the area between the fingers and under the nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (and not only one water) people are inclined to wash hands more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="82">The hands of the hands are at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Friction helps to remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you track your hands, the more microbes are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Carefully rinse hands under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Running hands in standing water can provoke re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="86">Choose your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet and wet hands are easier to pollute. The most often people leave no attention to such areas as a large finger, a wrist, an area between fingers and under nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and nail cracks can contain many microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent skin drying, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="90">If the running water and soap are inaccessible, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash the hands: pouring water from hanging jerricans or bottle pumpkin with the holes made and (or) using ash, if necessary, such as in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot cranes and other inexpensive options.</seg>
<seg id="91">The crane with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a capacity hanged on the rope, and the foot lever, which should be pressed, to the hands of the water, and the piece of soap should be used.</seg>
<seg id="92">Efficient hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets is under way.</seg>
<seg id="93">The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the Westminster University in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of paper napkins and towels; the subject of the study was the comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern streaming air dryers.</seg>
<seg id="95">It was found that after washing and drying hands in the dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on fingerprints on average increases by 194%, and on palms - by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the dryer with air flow, the total number of bacteria on fingerprints increased by 42%, and on palms - by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on fingerprints decreases on average to 76%, and on palms - up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to toilet rooms and toilets in each type of drying.</seg>
<seg id="98">String-air dryer, which releases air with declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), can blow microorganisms with hands and from its own block and potentially contaminate other users of the toilet and bathroom within a radius of up to 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">In the case of paper towels, there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study on the evaluation of various hand drying methods.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the drying method:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many different hand dryers and hand dryers compare with dry paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">Purification of hands using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">The disinfectant for hands on a alcoholic basis shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The medical method of washing hands became obligatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignac Zemmelweis discovered his high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices reminiscent of hospital staff about the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.</seg>
<seg id="107">According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce infection.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water or gel for washing and wiping each part of the hands is used.</seg>
<seg id="109">The hands should be carefully wiped out of each other by crossing their fingers.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there are dirt on the nails, it is possible to use brush to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes can remain in the water present in the hands, it is important to rinse them well and to wipe out the nasty with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying the hands, closing the crane, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper towel should be used.</seg>
<seg id="113">This avoids the re-contamination of hands from these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">The goal of washing hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms (“microbes”) and to prevent their spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of washing hands remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash hands before touching patients, and thus distributing microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">According to the results of one study, the correct washing of hands and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet with the image of a standard hand washing and processing procedure, which should be used in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="117">The WHO manual on manual hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="118">The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.</seg>
<seg id="119">When a regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and verify the hygiene of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization refers to “five moments” when we need to wash your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">after contact with blood or biological liquids,</seg>
<seg id="122">before using antiseptic, as well as</seg>
<seg id="123">after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap washing hands ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations or in an environment with a high content of antibiotic-resistant organisms. For "cleaning" hands before surgery require a crane, which can be included and off without touching its hands; it should also be used a little chlorhexidine or iodine water for rinsing hands, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, sterile brush for friction and other sterile tool for cleaning under nails.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewellery must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually within 2–6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need to lose hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="128">During the strip, the water with the forearm should not get back to the brushes of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the washing, the hands dry the sterile cloth and put the surgical bathrobe.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use antiseptic for hands before and after care procedures for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="131">In order to combat the staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of washing was the most useful from the washing of hands, and that very few additional advantages were obtained when the frequency of washing hands was increased by more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to the washing of antibacterial soap, washing hands with the usual soap leads to more than three triple increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of the wiping of the hands of alcohol-containing solution and washing of hands of antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that the processing of hands of alcohol-containing solution reduced the bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are still more efficient than alcohol solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the number of influenza virus A H1N1 in the hands and the Klastridium dispute. Hygiene development activities in medical institutions may include training of personnel to wash hands, improving the availability of alcohol-containing solutions for hands, as well as written and oral reminders of staff about the need to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various health facilities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is economically efficient and important to improve health and even digestion.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the absence of stable water supply, soap or means of washing hands in homes, in schools and in the workplace makes it difficult to habit regularly to wash hands.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from every private or public toilet to wash hands, although there are cheap ways to organize hands in such places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the lack of hygiene of hands can also be caused by entrenched habits, not by the absence of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and stimulating hand washing with soap can affect political solutions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.</seg>
<seg id="140">In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">In the systemic analysis of 70 studies, it has been found that in order to improve the hygiene situation in countries with income below the average level, sanitary and epidemiological surveillance at the community level, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund “Three Star Approach”: it promotes the implementation of simple economical measures in schools to stimulate hand washing by students using soap, as well as other hygienic requirements.</seg>
<seg id="142">By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Installation of handwritten men is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of information campaigns on the hygiene of hands in order to reduce the incidence and infant mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="144">World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-20 years, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="145">Some studies have seen the overall effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries against DALYs (saved years of life without disability).</seg>
<seg id="146">However, in one of the studies it is assumed that the stimulation of hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two innovators in the field of hygiene of hands: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse and “founder of modern care for the sick”.</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that infection was caused by rotten smells called miamatis.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and health-care infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became more proactive in promoting the hygiene of hands, as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of how important we are to wash hands with soap to protect the body from infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, in Germany, posters with “right hand washing technicians” were hanged in Germany next to the handwritten toilets and toilets of office buildings and airports.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase “stop hands” means manifesting its unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.</seg>
<seg id="153">It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “has failed his hands” when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase gained wider use in some English communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the play “Makbet” Shakespeare, the lady McBett is beginning to wash his hands in an attempt to cleanse himself of the imaginary spot that symbolizes the unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes that she has committed herself and prompted to commit her husband.</seg>
<seg id="155">It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act are more likely to wash their hands compared to other people, and they are more important for them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Also, it is less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after what they saw will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating events, such as volunteer activities.</seg>
<seg id="157">In religions, the washing of hands has both a hygienic goal and a symbolic significance. Symbolic washing hands with water, but without soap — is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'is, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory washing hands after visiting the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">The outbreak of coronavirus infection in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of the 2nd type (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: at the moment more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected exceeded 80,000.</seg>
<seg id="2">Like the Homological virus SARS-CoV, which caused the development of heavy acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is characterized by a lesser degree of disease and lower mortality rates than SARS, but it is much more controversial and striking older persons more often than young men and men more often than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease in this article, a relevant and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study is proposed.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virusology, diagnostics, treatment, forecasting of further current and prevention of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the answers to many questions have yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holiday of spring (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on 25 January, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to remain at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Taking into account the high degree of similarity with coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the accompanying disease was coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then almost 50 other countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients had been identified, more than 3,000 patients had died.</seg>
<seg id="11">WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months there were more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, from the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of a virus allocated from a number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronary-induced disease — coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the facts known at the moment about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Crowns have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly for humans and mainly cause approximately 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases 4.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century, we faced a high-pathogenic coronary of man twice, i.e. with coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and coronary of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other states with terrible levels of gravity of the disease and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">On 15 January 2020, the first lethal case in Wuhan was registered.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On 20 January, it became known about the infection of health workers, suggesting the possibility of transferring the virus to humans.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, quarantine was introduced in Wuhan, and the work of urban public transport ceased.</seg>
<seg id="25">On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, it was noted that 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus is a global public health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease spread throughout China and has already penetrated approximately 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).2).</seg>
<seg id="28">Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the degree of risk of outbreak have yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On 11 February 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 infection was exposed to all age groups, but people between the ages of 30 and 65 were mostly ill.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7 per cent) infected were over 50 years of age, very few under 20 and only 14 infected under 10 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 was distributed mainly by clusters in Hubei province and in nearby regions.</seg>
<seg id="34">On average, since the symptoms of COVID-19, 5 (2–9) days have been diagnosed with diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0–72) of the day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the symptoms, 9.5 (4.8–13) have taken place on average in the event of death.</seg>
<seg id="37">The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale transport transport on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis amounted to 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4,59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 contamination were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia cases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Crowns are a family of large shell viruses containing one thread of semantic RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and betaocoronavirus are known to affect people.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the case of damage to coronavirus type SARS and MERS glycolprotein shells (S) connects to cell receptors of anhyotenzine-returned fermentation of the 2nd type (ACE2) and dipeptidepeptide-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which the membrane synthesis occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">In cytoplasm the genome of viral RNA is released; after replication of the virus genome genomic RNA together with the shell glycol proteins and proteins of nucleocapsider generates varon-containing seicules, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betaoconavirus, whose genome is 99.98 per cent coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first hotbed of the disease, on the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">With the help of an enlightening electronic microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin respiratory epithelium cutters.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has been established that the ACE2 human enzyme is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ACE2 ferry of weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients a less severe disease than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also generate an previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and a secret protein encoded orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The protein orf3b virus SARS-CoV-2 can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motivation.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020 the authors of the authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of a full-size enzyme ACE2 with resolution 2.9 Å in a complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that this complex, which included open and closed transformations, collected as a dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could connect two S-protests, which is proof of the recognition of coronavirus and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 can be the therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that the source and SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to man through the crowd and camels respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flying mice, as the new virus is 96% identical to two similar SARS coronavirus, namely coronavirus of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it remains unknown what type of the interim master has been, thanks to which the virus has managed to overcome the species barrier and to infect humans; the path of transfer has also yet to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr. Ji (Ji) with his colleagues suggested that vectors of the virus from bats to man became snakes, during which there was a homological recombination in S-protestine.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to the results of its study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolines — long-term mammals, which feed ants and often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on 99 per cent genetic similarity between coronavirus Panollinov and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the difference in 1%, distributed between both genomes, is still very high, so the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 3 (Figure 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">In laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive within 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40–50 % humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; to effectively block the activity of the virus can be air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlor-containing disinfectants, peruktic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.</seg>
<seg id="67">The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, there are no data on the detailed research of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronaries, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).4).</seg>
<seg id="70">As a rule, the owner of the virus first recognizes the congenital immune system through the image receptors (ORR), including the receptors of the Swip-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.</seg>
<seg id="71">Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of I-type interferons, which contain the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocitosis of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the N-bed SARS-CoV can avoid immune reaction.</seg>
<seg id="73">A adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus soon.</seg>
<seg id="74">T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the protection of the body.</seg>
<seg id="75">T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill the affected cell virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, helping protective cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T-cells, causing their programmed death.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies allocated from a recovery patient neutralized MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system entails a local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to light and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older persons with accompanying pathologies and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">Probability of infection is higher for those who are exposed to large quantities of viruses or have immune system disorders.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3–7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period had lasted on average 3 days, with a scatter ranging from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A later study, based on the demographic data of 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected, who are asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="87">The general practice was the 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, hampered by breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, pain in throat, naming, breast pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients have experienced breath and (or) hypoxia in a week after the beginning of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, the disease quickly progressed, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the chest images.</seg>
<seg id="93">The demographic study, carried out at the end of December 2019, revealed the following prevalence of symptoms: 98% — high temperature, 76% - dry cough, 55% - breath and 3% - diarrhoea; 8% of patients required artificial lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have been obtained as a result of the last two studies of cases of contamination in the family and the transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="95">Comparable results were obtained in 2012 with the study of patients with MERS-CoV, who were also the main symptoms of high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of them were required by artificial lung ventilation, this figure is much higher than among COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">In patients with MERS there were also diarrhoea (26%) and pain in the throat (21%).</seg>
<seg id="98">The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99–100 %), dry cough (29–75%), breath (40–42 %), diarrhoea (20–25%) and pain in the throat (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation requires 14-20% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.</seg>
<seg id="100">In comparison with this indicator, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the case of MERS, the demographic study carried out in June 2012 showed mortality at 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to the results of the earlier study, the basic reproductive reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% of trust interval (CI) within 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only from 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread over MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the event of infection with the new virus is lower than the last two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, it will be much harder to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster manifestation often occurs when contaminated within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found together in any transport, such as a cruise liner.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often travelled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted with infected or ill-infected during the past two weeks before the beginning of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, according to data reported in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients who have been discharged from the hospital can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to the extension of the quarantine period.</seg>
<seg id="109">At an early stage in patients, normal or reduced leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were m lymphoids with a leukocyte level &lt; 4×109/L, including a leukocyte level &lt; 1×109/L, as well as an increased level of asparagin-aminotransferrases and virus.</seg>
<seg id="111">In the blood of some patients, high levels of liver enzymes were found, muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most patients experienced increased levels of P-reactive protein and erythrocytes in blood.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe diseases, the D-Dimer level, the decay product of the fibrin, present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most COVID-19 patients with a X-ray examination of the chest were detected by pathologies characterized by uneven darkness on both sides or by darkening of the type of “matt glass” in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ORZ).</seg>
<seg id="115">In the development of ORZ, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">The I and II pneumocyte pneumatic function reduces surface-active compounds and increases superficial tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, the worst results of X-ray research often coincide with the most severe cases of disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes and inter-tetanus lymphocyte infiltration, and multi-nuclear-current cells in lung patients, who died of the disease, correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ORZ and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="119">The main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (PCR with reverse transcription).</seg>
<seg id="120">However, given the high level of false-negative results that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 in China began to diagnose clinical manifestations (more than relying solely on PCR with reverse transcription).</seg>
<seg id="121">The situation with the diagnosis of SARS was similar.</seg>
<seg id="122">Thus, in order to effectively diagnose critical, it is important and necessary to combine the data of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, a group of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol application of SHERLOCK, based on the recompense of CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 density from 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies on the microlitre of the original sample) with the help of indicator stripes less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.</seg>
<seg id="124">This new methodology, if successfully tested for clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their holding.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in countering previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunity, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">To treat it, it was proposed to use even plasma of recoverable patients.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2, lightly, as well as, perhaps, less striking other organs, expressive ACE2, for example, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys are attacked.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, the violation of the work and the refusal of respiratory organs is the main threat and cause of death of patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, in order to facilitate symptoms and save lives, the support of respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of lungs, which are assigned depending on the severity of the disease, is critical.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (EMO), modified technique of extulpular blood circulation, used to treat the threatening life of heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, the maintenance of water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organs, are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is known that cytokino storm is a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="135">The cytokin storm is a form of system inflammatory process developing in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines provoke immunocytes to throw huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main cause of ORZ and polyorganic deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="137">In the treatment of cytokane storm, especially in patients in difficult condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.</seg>
<seg id="138">For cytokine storm treatment, corticosteroids and thoccycism, monoclonal antibodies, serving as an interlayer-in inhibitor were used.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other treatment methods of cytokin storm based on the suppression of immunity include the modulation of immune reaction aimed at control of T-cells; the blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of Janus-kin; the application of pancakeomomomab, cytokin signals 4 and inhibitors of histondeacetalazy.</seg>
<seg id="140">To reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity supporters.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids in large dosages do not benefit the treatment of severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially an excavation osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium-sized dosages are recommended for caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous introduction of a handicraftsman, nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment of the American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, the craftsman also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-time RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Relying on these data, Gilead provided this medication to China for pair research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results of these studies are looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, barricitinib, α-interferon, stapinavir/ronavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible therapy options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Combined treatment with the use of the strapiner/ronavir can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver lesions and other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction of these drugs with other medicines appointed to patients should be monitored with caution.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma recovering patients and developing antibodies</seg>
<seg id="153">The collection of blood in patients cured from contagious disease, for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population has been used for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, in the blood of recoverable patients often contain relatively high number of antibodies to fight pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and address them neutrally.</seg>
<seg id="156">On the basis of this premise, plasma was allocated from the blood samples of the group of patients cured by COVID-19, which was then introduced by 10 hard patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the inflammation and viral load have decreased, and blood sludge has increased by oxygen.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, in order to offer mass use of this method before carrying out specific therapy, it is necessary not yet carried out a check and not compiled explanations.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, given therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings in the use of plasma should be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytocain emission syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for treatment of patients in critical condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome the global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more important and practical to highlight the Cells of recoverable patients and to determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">So we will be able to move immediately to the mass production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">The Chinese millennia used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of the formula, which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain action, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">At present, due to the lack of an effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with light and medium gravity symptoms or for patients recovering after a severe stage of disease.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen Hua Qing Wen were recognized as effective in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The largest share of recoverable COVID-19 patients was observed in a number of provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningya (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest share of recovery (13%) was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a rough comparison, as the evaluation should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.</seg>
<seg id="172">On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study on the treatment of exclusively Western medicine and combined treatment techniques in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the timing of the normalization of the body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the conditions of hospital were significantly less in patients, for which the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine was used, rather than in patients who were treated only in Western methods.</seg>
<seg id="174">The most amazing is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate (from light condition to heavy), was noticeably lower in the group treated by means of a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group that was treated only on Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the efficiency and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research on a larger scale and in more regions.</seg>
<seg id="176">Some interest is also given to the description of the mechanism of action and the explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine, or their combination.</seg>
<seg id="177">Patients who suspect or have confirmed the presence of COVID-19, mostly experience severe fear of acute and even fatal disease, and people closed on quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side treatments, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater concern and psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the disease caused by the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased alarm, panic, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, divisibility and even suicidal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine among the measures taken by health authorities to curb the COVID-19, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contact with them, as well as to all other people it needs.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should form multidisciplinary teams of psychiatric care, establish clear information with regular and accurate updating of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain of infections and infected people to susceptible masters and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Work was carried out to create S-protestine vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">In animal studies, live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses were developed.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, prior to clinical trials, it is necessary to determine the validity of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in age patients, the model of infection with deadly doses and the degree of protection against zoonosis viruses.</seg>
<seg id="187">Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus has disappeared 17 years ago, and has since been notified of any new case.</seg>
<seg id="188">At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the MERS virus, nascent in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the persistence of zoonosis sources in endemic habitats, continue to occur.</seg>
<seg id="189">In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using an inactivated virus, plasmid DNA, viral vectors, nanoparticles, human-like particles and recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-members is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to deter the raging epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, there are serious difficulties due to long periods (an average of 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="192">As previously unknown, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high complications and high mortality among patients with severe diseases.</seg>
<seg id="195">In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to make a prognostic model of the disease to determine the priority of their measures, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on clinical studies presented at the moment, the following factors may affect the forecasting of the disease during patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: The age was the most important factor in forecasting the disease of the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">COVID-19 mainly strikes patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 86,66 cases.</seg>
<seg id="199">In patients requiring intensive therapy, the availability of source diseases and complications was more likely, and they were significantly older than those in which such therapy was not required (average 66 years against 51 years), which in favor of the fact that the age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Paul: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 v. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Disease and complications: In patients with COVID-19, which require intensive therapy, the likelihood of acute damage to myocardial and arrhythmia is higher.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of death of patients with SARS.</seg>
<seg id="203">It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to ACE2-positive cholongiocytes, which can cause liver disorders in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It should be noted that the age and source diseases are closely interrelated and can distort the results.</seg>
<seg id="205">Deviations identified in laboratory studies: The level of S-reactive protein in the blood reflects the gravity of the inflammatory process or damage to tissues, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also suggested that the relationship between the level of pro-active protein, the severity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, an elevated level of lactategidrogenase, asparagin-aminootransferrases, alanin-aminootransferazis and creativity are also predicted.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes in large quantities are allocated by different organs, especially in heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, these X-ray research and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="211">The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunity supporters, widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.</seg>
<seg id="212">Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS forms, many of the survivors developed an excavated osteonecrosis, causing lifetime disabilities and low quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if the steroids are used to treat COVID-19 patients, these drugs should be assigned in small dosages and short courses.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen strong stress, as they often have to withstand long-term quarantine periods, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">In order to remove stress from such patients and help them return to normal life, they must be subjected to psychological counselling and long-term support.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to the demographic studies carried out so far, the COVID-19, apparently different from the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses causing conventional cold diseases, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet ended the incubation period may, through their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological control significantly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, while in most cases it did not occur at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">There is currently a great deal of work in China, which has declared a universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as a quarantine regime for the entire population introduced to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spread chain.</seg>
<seg id="222">While these measures are causing tremendous harm to the economy and other spheres of life of the country, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="223">According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the attenuation phase will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Paul Hunter with his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19, which was much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Researchers from the group led by Ara Longini made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">The Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat strokes taken in patients recovering and discharged from hospitals earlier than two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.</seg>
<seg id="229">According to initial projections, Ebola's fever was to hit up to a million people and cause half a million patients to cause death.</seg>
<seg id="230">But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to control.</seg>
<seg id="231">It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infected ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or turn into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with a person.</seg>
<seg id="232">Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high speed of transmission through cough or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with the materials contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus was also detected in the cale, which means that it is also possible to transfer an oral-fiscal way.</seg>
<seg id="235">According to one of the latest studies, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers in contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense in the struggle to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; and surgical masks, and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help to control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks do not provide microcopies of liquid with potentially infected flying in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only Class N95 (series No. 1860s) masks can protect vyon inhalation from 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5% of vioons; the SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV and they both are approximately 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks, complicated together, health workers, directly in contact with patients, must wear class N95 masks (series No. 1860s), rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective bathrobe tailored to the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also get into the body through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he was mask of the N95 class; perhaps the virus hit his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent personal shields or closed-type protective glasses.</seg>
<seg id="245">All population in affected or potentially threatened regions is urged to be more likely to wash their hands with disinfectant detergents, to try not to leave the house, observing self-isolation, and to limit contacts with potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">A distance of about a meter is considered acceptable to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, was to be an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan calmed down citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproduction in the transfer from person to man and that the prevention of spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country has been preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and has been missed at a critical time when the disease could be kept within Wuhan with minimal losses.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development, rather than calm the public; and (4) more often conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular verification and improve society response.</seg>
<seg id="253">The outbreak of COVID-19, caused earlier by unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, the disease covered the whole of China and distributed 50 countries around the world at the time of writing.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the SARS recurrence has emerged when COVID-19 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, between COVID-19 and SARS there are some significant differences, significant in terms of containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 strikes older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and the mortality rate among older persons is also higher than among young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">Deaths as a result of SARS are higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Patients with COVID-19 distribute the virus even with impotent disease during the disease, while patients with SARS usually contaminate others only in severe cases, so it is harder to contain COVID-19 spread than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is distributed much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Some COVID-19 patients can be negative conventional samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, patients can again show positive samples on the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">All of this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite the discovery of 96 percent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like crowns of volatile mice, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">What animal has become an intermediate view of the virus from the original owner, such as bats, to the person?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably suspend the path of transfer, and the epidemiological situation may deteriorate at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Modeling at the molecular level and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how is the virus introduced into the respiratory tract cells and provokes subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other bodies?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How many times will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transferring from person to person?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS or will recurrently recidue like influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">These aspects are of paramount importance, but time will be needed to find answers to these and many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 Vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to take place.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine to be obtained earlier than 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five candidates for vaccines underwent studies on phase I security.</seg>
<seg id="5">The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in the development of the vaccine and research in its connection.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 use published genomes.</seg>
<seg id="8">As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms for creating an effective COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer phase I and vaccine-candidate for vaccine: Moderna, RNC-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">viral vector (developer of Phase I and candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus vector 5)</seg>
<seg id="13">According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milkena Institute); more than 37 vaccine vaccines were declared, but there are few publicly available information (presumably at the stage of planning or development).</seg>
<seg id="14">Phase I-II pre-testing for safety and immunogenicity is carried out, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and several sites, while identifying more accurate and effective doses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention and are simultaneously monitored by side effects with optimal dosages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested (all are still in pre-clinical research).</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it explored the potential of a vaccine with molecular clamp, which genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced the commencement of its own vaccine to start testing in 2021 people.</seg>
<seg id="19">The launch of vaccine development projects was also announced at the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Centre on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.</seg>
<seg id="20">On 29 January 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hannek Shuitmeiker announced the start of work on the creation of their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart develops a oral vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020 Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart for the development of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine on technology similar to that used for vaccination against neo-Nantigen cancer.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the synthesis of the vaccine and the commencement of tests.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to develop a peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their aim was to develop a vaccine-candidate drug that could be tested for people in 90 days.</seg>
<seg id="27">On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects for the development of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="28">On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Command for Medical Research and Material Support, Fort Detrik, and the Walter Rida Research Army, Silver Spring, which are located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">On March 10, 2020 Emergent Biosolutions announced that he had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">for the development and production of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="31">Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and clinical trials of phase I by July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, the development of a vaccine would require at least one and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="33">On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Québec, reported that partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research had created a particle like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The potential vaccine is carried out by laboratory studies, and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac “big money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19, against which the German government expressed its protest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, Pfizer’s American pharmaceutical company announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of the RNA vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">BNT162 is a candidate for a vaccine on the basis of the RNA; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020 the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will get the results of pre-clinical tests, and their final candidate for vaccine can start testing on people in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Preparedness for Epidemics (CEPI), France, announced the investment of 4.9 million US dollars in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI’s total investment in the COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other investment partners CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong Universities, Oxford and Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Imperial College researchers, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-pressing RNA-vaccine from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million to cover 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine-candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, saying that “MNA has introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-units vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice], which appeared in 2 weeks after immunization.”</seg>
<seg id="47">On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterlolo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine, which may be produced in the form of spray spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">DNA bacteriophages will multiply inside human bacteria and create harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities united IBM supercomputers resources combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cloud computing resources, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they can have other advantages in addition to the properties of disease prevention.</seg>
<seg id="52">Another randomized study carried out in Australia covers 4170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">The vaccines being developed may not be insecure or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies on the assessment of the effectiveness of animal vaccines, which are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic masks, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain infection with the biosafety level 3 when processing live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there are no medicines or protective vaccines for SARS treatment, which would be safe and effective for people.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world. MERS also does not have a proven vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="58">When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the study of SARS, which was carried out at that time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic means against the infection of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, there was one (funded DNA) vaccine from MERS, which took place Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on viral vector and were in the process of development, two - Adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one - MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).</seg>
<seg id="60">In social networks, the theory of conspiracy was distributed, arguing that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that the vaccine already existed.</seg>
<seg id="61">Publications on social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents for genetic sequences of other crown strains, such as coronavirus SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anguiotenz-returned enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 counteractes the activity of the corresponding angiotenzene-resistant enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotenzene-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often mentioned as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anguiotenz-returned enzyme 2 is zinc-containing metal-ferment, located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains N- end-to-end peptide M2 and S-Continental Domain of the renal amino acid collective.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-passed membrane protein type I, its enzyme proactive domain gets on the surface of light and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ACE2 intake domain is shifted from the transmembrane domain to another enzyme known as the masterpiece, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually displayed with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of light type II, enterocittes of the thin intestine, blood and venous endothelial cells and cells of smooth muscles of the most organs of the organs.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 and RNA biosynthesis are also found in the crust of the brain, stretch, hypotalamus and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE split the hormone of angiotenzine I into a vessel-dressing angotenosis II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, shifts the carboxic end amino acid of phenylanin from angiotenzene II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into the vasodilator angiotenzene (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - feminine, opera, neurotension, dinorphin A and sin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid of the SLC6A19 and is present at the Hartnup disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembered protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Strictly speaking, the bindings of S1 spikes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and broadcasting both the virus and the enzyme in endosoma, located inside the cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This login process also requires the price of protein protein proteins TMPRSS2, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool. This has led some to the idea that the decline in ACE2 levels in cells can help in the fight against infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard inhibitors and BRA therapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a systematic review and metaanalysis, published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group”.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were exposed to higher risk, pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a total risk of pneumonia.”</seg>
<seg id="22">It is assumed that the recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is an innovation in the therapy of acute lung damage and seems to improve the lung hemodynamics and saturation with oxygen at powder with acute respiratory failure caused by lipopolischarides.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life rhACE2 period in people is about 10 hours, and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some data indicate that rhACE2 can become a promising tool for people with intolerance of classic inhibitors of the roman-angiotenzene system (inhibitors of RAS) or for diseases in which the circulating angotenosis II is increased. Introduced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory plass syndrome.</seg>

<seg id="1">The pandemic of coronavirus 2019–2020 is the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was revealed in Ukhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020 an emergency of international importance in the field of public health was declared, which later, on March 11, 2020, was recognized as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19, had been recorded in 210 countries and regions, killing approximately 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people have recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory dumps syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, the vaccine or specific treatment is not found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth at cough, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-isolation of people suspected of infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">The authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, risk control in the workplace and closure of various facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as the widespread shortage of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students around the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the Internet, disinformation on the virus, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of Eastern and South-East Asia, or people reminiscent of their foreign, as well as other groups of people living in areas where the virus has been reported has been distributed.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Wuhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and in early January 2020 the investigation of the situation was initiated.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cases of contamination were mainly related to the wholesale market of seafood Huanan, so the virus is believed to have zoonosis origin.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently open virus with a great similarity to coronavirus flying mouse, coronavirus pangoline and SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the very first case of the disease was 1 December 2019, and the contracted did not enter the market after that date.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two thirds of the cases of contamination recorded in December 2019 were related to this market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On 13 March 2020 in the publication of the South China branch of the newspaper “Morning Post”, the information of which was not checked, it was suggested that the very first case of contamination occurred with a 55-year-old resident of the province of Hubei on November 17, 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but had unexpectedly rising in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of cases of occurrence may be significantly underestimated, in particular due to many cases with pronounced symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people had been registered, with patients who 19 years of age and younger accounted for less than 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. The United Kingdom’s main scientific adviser, Patrick Vallas, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the effective group immunity of the country’s population.</seg>
<seg id="23">Statistics include cases of contamination of people who have been tested on COVID-19, and whose test has proved to be positive according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="24">As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, official policies had been adopted that required not to test only minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on 16 March showed that in China, up to 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not found and that unregistered patients were a source of contamination for 79 per cent of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">The statistical analysis issued on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual contamination in Italy was largely higher than the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initial estimates of the basic reproductive rate of infection (R0) on COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention assumes that this figure can be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 are safely recovering.</seg>
<seg id="30">In others, more complex cases, the time from the beginning of the development of symptoms to the moment of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period is 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on the mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic typically include information on patients' deaths with positive COVID testing, carried out according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of COVID-19 deaths can be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the deceased people who have not been tested — for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4–5 times.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recognizes: “We know that the [applied number of dead] is lower than the actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. Such accounting with incomplete data is often found in pandemics such as H1N1 2009 pig flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was registered in Ukhan on 9 January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first death outside mainland China was registered on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia on 14 February.</seg>
<seg id="37">By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica reported deaths. Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">All indicators vary according to the region and the time of spread of the disease; they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time from the beginning of the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The “death/fighting” ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed infections during the specified time interval.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and cases of contamination is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Data for different regions differ.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the ratio of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms of January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of mortality due to disease (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of mortality from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not linked to specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups from the moment of contamination before the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientists tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the Oxford University evidentiary medicine, the mortality rate from the pandemic is generally between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with statistical research analysing the impact of testing on CFR evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="47">WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and the exact flash duration cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Maca Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, argues that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to reach the plateau and then when the number of available carriers ends, they are beginning to extinguish.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when this will happen.”</seg>
<seg id="51">The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanshan, argues that “all may end by June”, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate perhaps during a year or two”.</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a study by the Imperial College under the leadership of Nil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more)”, physical distances and other measures will be required.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don’t think that this coronavirus ever ever disappeared everyone, because it is so easily transmitted,” as well as that he “may turn into a seasonal disease, flashing every year”.</seg>
<seg id="55">The incidence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can carry disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are increased temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, wet formation in respiratory tract (spectre), loss of smell, breath, muscle pain and joints, pain in the throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood flow, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO argues that it is ill in a serious form with the development of respiratory problems about one in six people.</seg>
<seg id="59">U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) transfer such urgent symptoms as breathing difficulties, constant pain or sensation in breasts, sudden sensation of confusion of consciousness, difficulties in awakening and sitting face or lips. If these symptoms are available, medical care should be immediately sought. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory dioxide syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the contamination, so doctors recommend placing persons in close contact with patients, the diagnosis of which is confirmed, under strict control and examination for infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic flow rate ranges from several units to 44% of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="62">The usual incubation period (time between contamination and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. While there is no full clarity on the symptom of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of COVID-19, which developed this symptom, originally accounted for 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details of the way in which the disease is disseminated is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops emitted into the air together with the cough, sneezing or during the conversation; in close contact means contacting within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">According to some studies, open coughing can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops emitted into the air during the conversation that can remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also be formed in exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not tolerated by air.</seg>
<seg id="67">The drops can get into the mouth or nose of the nearby people, as well as in the light.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cordial resuscitation (SLR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and thus spreading the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">It can also penetrate the body if a person concerns contaminated surface, including skin, followed by touch with his eyes, nose or mercury.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this way of transfer is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denies the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious for the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although its distribution can occur both before symptoms and later stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="72">There have been cases in which tests have been positive in testing three days before symptoms appear, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus to the pronounced manifestation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed asymptomatic diseases of the disease, but in the course of research on tracking contacts in some countries, cases of transmission of the disease from impotent carriers have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="74">Employees of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easy the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient usually contaminates 2–3 others. The virus can survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on the cardboard surface - within one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Home and other animals have a positive result on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can transfer the virus to people, although the British authorities are advised to wash their hands after contacting animals, just as, for example, after contacting other surfaces to which infected people can touch.</seg>
<seg id="78">Heavy acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first discovered by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ukhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in the konavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of a domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a large similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is assumed to have zoonosis origin.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the birth of Betacoronavirus, a teenager of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of viruses of bats.</seg>
<seg id="82">At a holistic and genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of crowns of flying mouse (BatCov RaTG13).</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangoline and man.</seg>
<seg id="84">A whole-genogenic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) has between coronavirus Panolina and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate masters of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should eventually be confirmed by analysing the polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCP) of infected secret or computer tomography.</seg>
<seg id="86">The results of the study, which compares the methods of PCR and KT, used in Ukhan, showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and diseases processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis”.</seg>
<seg id="88">WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on 17 January.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time testing of polymeric chain reaction is carried out (RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Usually for carrying out the test is used strokes made of nasrocht, although can also be used strokes from zev. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to identify antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the U.S. serological test developed by Cellex was approved for application in emergency cases only certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">The characteristic features of visualization of symptoms on X-ray and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral clouds on the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural slot.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian radiological society is engaged in the development of the international base of images of confirmed cases of contamination.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to similarity with other infections such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19 images, not confirmed by PCR tests, there are limited clinical specifics.</seg>
<seg id="98">In China, a major study was carried out, during which the results of the CT chest and PCR testing were compared, and it was found that while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were more sensitive and therefore the diagnostic method could be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">To diagnose the virus with X-ray and computer tomography, drilling neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include the maintenance of common personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding the touch of eyes, nose or mercury with dirty hands, using cough or sneezing napkins, which should be thrown immediately after use.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may have contracted, should dress up a medical mask in human places.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance from people. Many Governments recommend that any indefinite visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak be avoided and that the movement of citizens be limited.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical workers careing for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contacting others and eye protection. Monitoring of contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent its further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">The use by Governments of the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International) and more than 100 other organizations have made statements requiring that this type of monitoring be limited to people.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on the development of solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data — for example, the registration of the proximity of the user to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.</seg>
<seg id="107">If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he received the corresponding notification. There are also groundless versions of how to prevent infection — for example, nose and mouth strip, which is actually ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">At the moment, COVID-19 vaccines do not exist, although many organizations are working to establish it.</seg>
<seg id="109">In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash hands.</seg>
<seg id="110">CDC (Control and Prevention Centre) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hands of hands, as well as before food, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is necessary, because while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which reveals its protective shell.</seg>
<seg id="112">In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectants for hand processing on a alcoholic basis with alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="113">WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, nose or mercury with dirty hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">Surface can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel disinfectant begins to operate a minute after applying) with a content of 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% of the propaganda, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% obedience-yoda.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other components, such as chloride of petrol and gluconat chlorhexidine, are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in the institution, such as office or day hospital, all spaces of such premises, including rooms, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control and ATMs used by patients, disinfected.</seg>
<seg id="117">Medical organizations recommend that cough or sneezing cover the mouth and nose by the rear side of the elbow or napkins and immediately throw the objects of hygiene used.</seg>
<seg id="118">For those who may have been infected, it is recommended to use medical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that are dissipated in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.</seg>
<seg id="119">WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist from the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touch to face dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who can be infected.</seg>
<seg id="121">WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are exposed to high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although she also recognizes that the use of the mask, indeed, reduces the number of touch to face.</seg>
<seg id="122">Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">CDC centers, the USA, recommend to wear tissue face masks of non-medical purpose. China separately stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.</seg>
<seg id="124">In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear medical mask in public transport or human places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials call on people to produce personal tissue masks at home and to erase them every day.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks, closing nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="127">On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Government of Austria has obliged all visitors to wear medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="130">On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks per day were produced from mid-March, it was prescribed to use medical masks to all passengers in trains and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="131">In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; those residents who cannot acquire masks were recommended to sew them on their own at home.</seg>
<seg id="132">Medical masks are also widely used by Japanese, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Social distancing (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures of protection include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">People can use social distances, while remaining at home, limiting travel, avoiding human places using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many regions of the regions, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="137">The maximum number of people who can meet in one place according to the recommendation of the U.S. government bodies and health-care organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there were no data on COVID-19), up to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.</seg>
<seg id="138">On 22 March 2020, Germany banned going to groups, including more than two people. Older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune system face increased risk of virus in a serious form. CDC recommend them to stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distancing” at “physical distancing”, thus specifying the purpose of this measure — to reduce physical contacts within social ties, whether through virtual communication or in compliance with physical distance.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term “social distancing” was understood in such a way that people should be completely socially excluded, rather than staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health, which should be used during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">Among others, recommendations have been made to have sexual intercourse only with their permanent partners, with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that it has no virus and its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended self-isolation at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health institutions have published detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many Governments have also made themselves mandatory or recommended to the entire population of the affected areas to place themselves on quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="143">Persons in high-risk groups were instructed by the strictest quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="144">Persons who may have contacted contaminated COVID-19, or have recently visited the country or region, have been significantly affected by the epidemic, and the quarantine has been recommended for 14 days since the last possible contact.</seg>
<seg id="145">Strategies to combat outbreak include containment of the spread of the disease, its suppression or mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">The prevalence of the disease is carried out in the early stages and is aimed at tracing and isolating infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.</seg>
<seg id="147">At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being directed towards mitigating the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigation of the epidemic to the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be undertaken simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the outbreak of infectious diseases are aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the alignment of the epidemic curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for vaccines and treatment.</seg>
<seg id="151">Pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass events; the involvement of the community in promoting and participating in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface treatment. Since the seriousness of the outbreak in China, more decisive action has been taken to deter outbreak, such as isolation of entire cities and strict travel bans.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantine were introduced, as well as the system of alert of the infected persons was organized.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons in self-isolation and imposed high fines on those who did not.</seg>
<seg id="155">In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fines were increased for the accumulation of surplus medicines. The United Kingdom and the United States have shown that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (deceleration, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stop the growth of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal policies to mitigate the impact of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality is twice, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">The suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used until the virus circulates to the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when measures are weakened.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term intervention to suppress pandemic leads to social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">There are currently no anti-survivors approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Reception of non-receipt drugs from cold, drinking enough fluid and rest can help alleviate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous introduction of fluid and respiratory support.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroid drugs can only harm.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also considered for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic funds” could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">WHO views capacity-building and health adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="166">The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to assist in the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19, lifting of non-delayed procedures, where possible, the identification of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as the increased capacity of intensive care through training of staff and the increase in the number of available IVL and beds.</seg>
<seg id="167">There are various theories about where the very first case of contamination could arise — the so-called “zero patient”.</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of contamination of the new coronavirus infection was probably on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan Province of Hubay, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">During the month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei province has gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Basically they were related to the wholesale market of seafood Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonosis origin. On 26 December, a mass disease of an unknown origin was registered at the Hubei Provincial Clinic, with a doctor from Zhang Tianjin, who reported this case on 27 December to the Jianghan Ratification and Prevention Centre in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors of the central clinic of the city of Wuhan warned his colleagues about the "Konovirus, similar to SARS".</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlyan, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, received a reprimand from his superiors for raising panic.</seg>
<seg id="173">Later, on December 31, the Ukhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="174">The Ukhanyan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of contamination in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">According to later official data, by 20 January 2020 the symptoms of the disease have already appeared in 6,174 people. As at 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy by the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection had been recorded worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered case of contamination.</seg>
<seg id="179">Owing to the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen area have limited their free movement and have established border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">National responses included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as the compulsory stay of a house, compulsory shelter at home or isolation), as well as curfews. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were on any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million people were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later, this figure increased to 2.6 billion people, about one third of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Ukhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the reliability of which was not verified, this date is 17 November.</seg>
<seg id="183">On December 26, the doctor Zhang Jisyan worked with the case of mass disease of pneumonia of an unknown type, about which on December 27 her clinic was notified to the Center for Control and Prevention of the morbidity of Jianghan in the city of Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="184">Primary genetic testing of samples of patients, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="185">On 31 December, the Ukhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="186">WHO was notified on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">With regard to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Ukhan of responsibility for “disseminating rumors” outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="188">Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission argued that there was no “new evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transferred from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary General of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping “people’s war”.</seg>
<seg id="190">The events of “the largest-scale quarantine in human history” were launched, on 23 January the sanitary cordon and the ban on entry into Wuhan and back were announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei and affected a total of about 57 million people.</seg>
<seg id="191">The city forbade the use of personal transport.</seg>
<seg id="192">In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="193">The authorities also announced the construction of the Huoshenshan Temporary Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leyshenshan, which received other incoming patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also re-profiled 14 other institutions in Ukhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travelers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration period.</seg>
<seg id="196">Un universities and schools have been closed throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="197">Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of work.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="200">The schedule of public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">In many cities, the movement of citizens has been introduced, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have faced a form of outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="202">In Beijing, for example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city was introduced. As at 23 March, only one case of domestically transmitted infections had been recorded mainland China, which had occurred five days before that, in the case of a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was mainly stopped, and the outbreak in China was taken under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, except Ukhanyan, were withdrawn through two months after the closure of the province on quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that since 28 March, entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact time frame for the cancellation of the order was not mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those who wish to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.</seg>
<seg id="206">On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and to provide the company with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00 a.m., a national three-minute “ silence minute” was held, which opened the day of mourning for victims of coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Kuinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims of the online, observing the physical distance to avoid the re-emergence of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">It was confirmed that COVID-19 extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.</seg>
<seg id="208">On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, which took place largely because a large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji, gathered in Tagu.</seg>
<seg id="209">Shinchonji followers came to Tagu from Ukhanyan, who is supposedly a source of flash.</seg>
<seg id="210">As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported having symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea was declared the highest alarm.</seg>
<seg id="211">On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of contamination were registered in Korea, and on 29 February this figure increased to 3,150.</seg>
<seg id="212">All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after the three soldiers confirmed the presence of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="213">The outbreak affected the number of travels, hence the flight schedule of airlines was changed. South Korea has launched a population screening program for the presence of a virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contact persons. The programme is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods included mandatory information about their symptoms through a mobile application by all those who came from abroad, the numbering of the virus, the results of which were ready for the next day, as well as the expansion of testing opportunities, which allowed daily testing to 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="215">The South Korean programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there. Initially, South Korean society was divided because of President Mun Zhei’s reaction to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called on Mr. Mun impeach to respond inappropriate, in their view, to the Government's outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="217">On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total incidence of infection in one day for four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On 29 March, it was reported that, since 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea sought assistance in testing for virus 121 countries.</seg>
<seg id="220">On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="221">The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that the government does not plan to carry out quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be placed on quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, plans were announced to limit intercity trips, but intensive movement between cities over the Persian New Year continued.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shia shrines in Kum remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of spreading the virus after China in February.</seg>
<seg id="226">Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February, more than 10 countries had tied them to Iran, indicating that the outbreak of the outbreak could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, the results of the testing for the virus were positive.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Guard) called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to temporarily release all prisoners suitable for this category.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.</seg>
<seg id="230">On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="231">By 17 March, at least 12 existing or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus and every ten minutes were recorded in Iran every hour, one new death from coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to the WHO representative, the morbidity rate in Iran can be five times higher than those reported at the official level.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="235">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded the easing of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had hit Italian territory when two Chinese tourists had tests on SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome, had yielded positive results.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of cases of contamination was rapidly growing, prompting the Government of Italy to suspend all flights to China and China and to declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">Later, a non-associated cluster of COVID-19. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to contain outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Konte said: “The entry into and exit from the disease zone will be closed.</seg>
<seg id="240">In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and to cancel sports activities.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as the death of 100 people was already recorded in Italy at that time.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sports events, including football matches series A, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9 all sports events were postponed for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered to suspend almost all commercial activities and to close enterprises with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, analgesia, resuscitation and intensive therapy (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics with regard to the protocols of the provision of medical care to patients, which may have to be used.</seg>
<seg id="243">On 19 March, Italy overturned China in terms of the mortality rate from coronavirus, ranking first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As at 5 April, there were 128,984 coronavirus cases in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">One CNN report notes that this high mortality rate in Italy can contribute to a combination of two factors — a large number of older citizens of that country and the lack of opportunity to explore all those who are currently suffering from coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="247">The United Kingdom responded to the virus most peacefully from all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not commit itself to respect for any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result, the Government had been criticized for the insufficient and serious response to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he recommended that all visits and social contacts that were not of paramount importance should be refrained by offering people, if possible, from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.</seg>
<seg id="249">On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of wages, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social disturbances, prohibiting the collection of more than two people and limiting travel and active outdoor recreation only to cases of extreme necessity.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the dispersal of people's accumulations.</seg>
<seg id="251">Most enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide “life of the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, economic shops, petrol stations and garages.</seg>

<seg id="255">On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the organization of the U.S. government in the field of public health, announced that it had developed its own set for testing.</seg>
<seg id="256">Despite this, the population testing in the United States has not been started immediately, and as a result the true outbreak of the disease has been hidden during this period.</seg>
<seg id="257">Testing was hampered by the marriage of test sets issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence of a federal government permission to use non-State test sets by the end of February, which were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to March, which would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the purpose of the attending physician).</seg>
<seg id="258">The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests were conducted in the United States by 27 February.</seg>
<seg id="259">The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests were held by March 13.</seg>

<seg id="263">Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff, cancelled conferences and called on staff to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">Sports activities and seasons have been cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced his travel restrictions in most of Europe, with the exception of the UK, for 30 days, starting on March 13.</seg>
<seg id="265">The following day, he expanded the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On 13 March, the President announced a state of emergency in the country, enabling the use of federal funds to combat the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Starting from 15 March, many companies have become closed or reduced hours of work throughout the US, helping to combat the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10,700 cases of infection per day had been reported in New York, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="269">On 25 March, the Governor said that social distancing was probably an effective measure, as the estimates of the doubling of the number of cases had decreased from 2.0 to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As at 28 March, 32 30,308 cases had been recorded in New York and 672 had died. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As at 8 April, 4003,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, 12,841 deceased.</seg>

<seg id="272">On the same day, USNS Comfort was moored at the port of New York by 1,000 beds.</seg>
<seg id="273">On 3 April, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States for 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="274">In New York, on 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information on open access by controlling public statements and publications by officials and scientists in the health sector associated with the virus through the Office of Vice-President Mike Penza.</seg>
<seg id="275">Overall, the views of the supporters of President Trump on how successful it was to cope with the crisis were divided.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some officials and observers criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of critical materials, including basic necessities, from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">In mid-January 2020, the Travel Medicine magazine published an analysis of air travel schemes, which was used to mapping and forecasting the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="278">Based on the information of the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei took the largest number of travelers from Ukhanya.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.</seg>
<seg id="280">Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was named the least ready for the outbreak of disease, while Australian cities are considered to be the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its contingency plan for the new coronary (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="281">In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be clarified on COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in the threat situation.</seg>
<seg id="282">On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="283">Thanks to the effective quarantine measures taken in the public transport sector in Ukhan and Hubee, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, which the Chinese authorities have authorized.</seg>
<seg id="284">Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to evacuate their citizens.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan stated that it was not intended to evacuate citizens from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, Chinese and Indian national.</seg>
<seg id="287">Polish citizens, China and India landed in Poland, where the Brazilian aircraft stopped before flying to Brazil according to the route.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens visiting Wuhan were placed in a quarantine at a military base near the city of Brasilia.</seg>

<seg id="294">On 21 February, an aircraft from 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Billant Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, the South African Airways aircraft chartered by the Government of South Africa departed from 112 South African citizens on board.</seg>
<seg id="296">A medical examination of passengers was carried out before the departure, and four South Africans who found signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans have been evacuated with negative analyses of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="298">The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, and they remained under the supervision and on quarantine for 14 days in The Ranch Resort.</seg>
<seg id="299">On 20 March, the United States began to withdraw its troops from Iraq in part in connection with the pandemic.</seg>

Direct Relief Organization, together with FedEx, sent an ambulance to the Ukhany Union 200,000 medical masks as well as other personal protective equipment, including gloves and bathrobes, by 30 January.</seg>
<seg id="302">On 5 February, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of $100 million to WHO to finance the development of vaccine and crown treatment, as well as for the protection of “Africa and South Asia risk groups” from the threat of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="303">Interaksyon reported that on 6 February, the Chinese government handed over to the Philippines a donation of 200,000 medical masks after Senator Richard Gordon sent $3.16 million to Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="304">On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it is going to send assistance to China in the amount of $2.26 million.</seg>

After the situation in China stabilized, the country also sent assistance to other countries affected by the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="307">Businessman Jack Ma sent to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million sets for testing, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective costumes to distribute them to their States parties.</seg>
<seg id="308">Later, he also sent 5,000 testing sets, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL devices in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">Also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about medical masks and testing sets for Chinese production.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese crown testing kits to ensure the accuracy of only up to 30%, and the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 marriages of Chinese medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unsuitable medical masks: it was assumed to have been manufactured in China, but it was subsequently that they had come from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, Chinese aid was well accepted in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations to developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and to curb the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="314">WHO noted the apparent differences between the outbreak of the Atypian pneumonia that took place in 2002–2004, during which the Chinese authorities were charged with classifying information, which allegedly prevented the prevention of the disease and deterring its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year”.</seg>
<seg id="315">On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban the movement of transport in Ukhan, the representative of WHO Goden Galea noted that, while “this measure was definitely recommended not by WHO”, it is also a “very important confirmation of the fulfilment of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the greatest proliferation place”, and called it “unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after the ability of the infection to be transmitted from human to person outside China and the increase in the number of contaminated countries in other countries, WHO declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation has become the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the pandemic of swine flu.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, said that the PHEIC announcement was due to the “risk of global distribution, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.</seg>
<seg id="317">Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “no reason for measures that unduly hamper international movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.</seg>
<seg id="318">On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $75 million to ensure strategic readiness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.</seg>
<seg id="319">Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is a degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “ make a choice: to invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease — COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.</seg>
<seg id="321">As a result, the UN Crisis Management Group, which coordinates all United Nations responses, has been established; these steps, as WHO states, will “focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic plan”.</seg>
<seg id="322">On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in the country's situation and to assess the “seriousness of the disease and its controversy”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess the “effectiveness of provincial and district responses, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus, noting that it is too early to call the disease the pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.</seg>
<seg id="323">When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of a global distribution of coronavirus would be increased with “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This review of each government on the planet is ready for real status: it is time to act.</seg>
<seg id="325">This virus may already be on your way to your country, and you need to be ready,” and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid “worst scenario”.</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan also stated that the current data did not give rise to a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize that everyone on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus”.</seg>
<seg id="327">On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high level of dissemination and the seriousness of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem”. WHO is seriously criticized for an inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the later announcement of an emergency in the area of public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="329">As a response to the situation addressed to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, a petition was lodged with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 7333,000 as at 6 April.</seg>
<seg id="330">On 26 March 2020, the dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply the measures that rescued life, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.</seg>
<seg id="332">The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be invoked as a justification for discrimination against a particular group of people.</seg>
<seg id="333">Experts stressed that everyone had the right to health, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has established a platform for timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as for views and recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="336">The Digital Node contains information on policy measures from different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, to address the consequences of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and to promote a coordinated global response to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="337">The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gouwa and Eduardo Bolson, the son of the President of Brazil, Jaira Bolson, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="338">A number of the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) of the provincial level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals testified to the discontent of the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping from the public of the public about the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of coronavirus began in Ukhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 arose in the US or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration called the coronavirus “Chinese virus” or “Ukhanya Virus”, stating that “the censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “details the administration of the U.S. President’s administration to contain the spread of the disease”.</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast has gained access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communication strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council; there are such references to the strategy: “Everything in China.</seg>
<seg id="343">We are asked to extend this information to any possible means, including press conferences and television statements.” Such organizations as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to assist countries suffering from the virus are part of the “promotion” to gain global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">EU Foreign Minister Joséppe Borrell warned about the presence of the “geopolitical component, including the struggle for influence through the piano and the so-called generosity policy”.</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrell also stated that “China is persistently promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US.”</seg>
<seg id="346">China also called on the U.S. to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information that sending assistance in the last two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">The donation of Jack M 100,000 medical masks of Cuba was banned from the U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.</seg>
<seg id="348">The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid for other countries to their own country.</seg>
<seg id="349">Medical masks also arose disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IWL apparatuses for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the crown of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “only China reacted bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">This does not clearly demonstrate European solidarity.”</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, following a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Konte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military nurses, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “political source of high level”, claiming that 80% of Russian aid was “useless or little useful for Italy”.</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of striving to make a favorable impression on the world community at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.</seg>
<seg id="357">President Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Louigi Di Mayo rejected media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical care in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “proposing assistance to American colleagues [Putin] presupposes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials grow the rate of production, they will also be able to provide retaliation if necessary”.</seg>
<seg id="360">NATO military exercises “Protector-2020”, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States — the largest military exercises in NATO after the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a abbreviated format.</seg>
<seg id="361">The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Keith Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 teachings (Protection-2020)”: “The crisis situation in the public health sector today jeopardizes the lives not only of the US military and many European participating countries, but also of the inhabitants of countries where such events should be held.” The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus. About two dozen members of Parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians, have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="362">On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, saying that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic has generated calls for the United States to adopt social policies that have been disseminated in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single health and childcare system paid for family leave and increased funding for public health.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political scientists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. The pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="364">South Korea criticized Japan’s “unambiguous and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen who came from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in designated government places.</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society was initially divided by President Mun Zhein’s reaction to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called on Mr. Mun impeach to respond inappropriate, in their view, to the Government's outbreak of disease. The pandemic had forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of the Prime Minister, Victor Orbanu, to manage indefinitely through decrees, suspend the work of Parliament, and hold elections and punish those who will be accused of disseminating fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The outbreak of coronavirus was named the cause of several cases of supply deficit due to global growth in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and disruptions of production and logistics operations.</seg>
<seg id="370">The Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment, which has arisen due to increased consumer demand and supplier failures.</seg>
<seg id="371">In several locations, panic purchases have also occurred; this has led to a situation in which essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, have disappeared with stores, which in turn has led to a shortage of reserves.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to the Director General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the demand for individual protection increased 100 times.</seg>
<seg id="374">This leap has led to twenty-fold price increases compared to the usual price, as well as to delays in the supply of medical supplies to four to six months.</seg>
<seg id="375">He also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be at a blow.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, in connection with the pandemic, buyers under the Digowa system had a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">These activities led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high demand for food, both areas have avoided acute food shortages.</seg>
<seg id="378">The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stockpiles and illicit trade in critical products, which have been successful, have avoided severe food shortages, which were expected in Europe, as well as in North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Northern Italy, whose agricultural production has small proportions, has not experienced significant recessions, but, according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products can grow.</seg>
<seg id="380">Food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in Wuhan, while China’s government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure the full nutrition of the population.</seg>

<seg id="382">The damage to the world economy has affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China’s economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus, which has been reduced by the government as a result of which retail sales declined by 20.5%.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mother China is a major economic and productive centre; it is therefore believed that the virus outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="384">According to Agate Demaray, Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in the markets will remain until a clearer picture of potential results appears.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could surpass the effects of the 2002–2004 epidemic of atypical pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="386">According to an estimate made by the expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “urgent measures” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to the fall in demand from China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, the world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19, outside of mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones index for industrial companies, showed the most sharp drop since 2008, while the Dow index fell by 1191 points, the largest one-day fall after the 2007–2008 financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the travel ban, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to make any visits.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.</seg>
<seg id="398">The negative impact on the cruise line has been more severe than ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ports of ferry crossing were also closed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with Chun Yun, the main tourist season of the Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="401">A number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual New Year's festivals, have been abolished by national and regional governments; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many New Year's events have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent people from accumulating; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City has been closed and traditional temple fairs have been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="403">In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended New Year's holidays until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling the New Year.

<seg id="409">Operators of shopping malls around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitary conditions, installing equipment to test visitors' temperature and cancel activities. According to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave a poverty of 14–22 million more than that would be a similar situation, but without a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Ukhan, in China, about 5 million people lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="411">Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were at home in their country or locked in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the outbreak of crowns in the United States could deprive 47 million people of jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The self-isolation measures imposed in India will leave dozens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive a daily fee without work. A study by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households faced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany have transferred their staff to the Government-subsidized reduced working schedule — part-time.</seg>
<seg id="414">The German part-time payment scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="415">The areas of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="416">The organizations of culture and art have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the security of their employees and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting people of art.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March by 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions have been closed around the world for an indefinite period, or have been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and representations have been cancelled or postponed to other dates.</seg>
<seg id="418">In return, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, large sports events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.</seg>
<seg id="419">There were also failures in the film industry. The Vatican announced the abolition of the activities of the Good Week in Rome, which are held last week of the Christian repentance period — Great Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services began broadcasting on radio, live or television, while leaders of some churches offer outdoor divine services.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter’s Square, where there are no more Christian pilgrims, and later other religious organizations also abolished divine services and limited access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourmets.</seg>
<seg id="422">The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.</seg>

<seg id="425">The outbreak of coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were to begin at the end of July; on March 24 the International Olympic Committee announced that the event will be “transferred to the period after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casino and other gambling establishments around the world have been closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, have also been either postponed or cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This has led many players to move to an online mode, and many sites dedicated to gambling report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry also suffered as various musical groups suspended or abolished concert tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also cancelled all their performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and exchanging its results on the Internet, to organize live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; it helps people of creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">The network has many Internet workshops on coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out alarming sentiments characteristic of periods of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an exacerbation of bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as for people in Europe, the United States and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="431">The occurrence of fear, suspicion and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="432">In information reports for February (when most cases of infection were still limited by China), racist sentiments were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retaliation for anything.</seg>
<seg id="433">In some African countries, there has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many residents of Ouhany and Hubaya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.</seg>
<seg id="435">Chinese citizens, as well as those living in the affected areas, have been supported both in offline and online mode.</seg>
<seg id="436">The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on prohibiting Chinese citizens from entering their countries to contain the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#КитайцыНеПриезжайтеВЯпонию) has taken the lead in Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, reported a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling coronavirus “Chinese virus”; critics consider this opinion to be racist and anti-Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="440">In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses that transported Ukrainian and foreign citizens, evacuated from Ukhanyan to New Sanjara.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students coming from the north-eastern India bordering China and in India's major cities reported cases of harassment related to the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="442">Diliep Ghosh, President of the State Party of Bharatia Janata, Western Bengali, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “therefore God has prompted them.”</seg>
<seg id="443">Later, these statements were condemned from the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “distribution”. In China, the pandemic once again erupted xenophobia and racism against non-China citizens: foreigners were called “foreign debris” and objects subject to “seizure”.</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all areas affected by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="445">Many scientific publishers have posted their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="446">Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on servers of the publication, such as bioRxiv.</seg>

<seg id="1">Control of production factors due to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">The control of the production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control the risk and control of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Adequate risk control in the workplace depends on the location and workplace, is based on the risk assessment, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who can be vulnerable to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Occupational Health and Industrial Health Authority (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk levels have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, stimulating workers to stay at home on the grounds of illness, respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contacts with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19, but are likely to be contaminated with the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Such a category may include workers in contact with the public, such as in schools, working environment with high population density and in some major retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Risk control measures for a group other than basic prevention measures include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protection tools for contact with a person contaminated with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA believes that health-care providers and mergers who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, are at high risk; while the level of risk is increased to very high in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of safety engineering, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.</seg>
<seg id="10">The COVID-19 outbreak can have different effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or for fear of possible contamination.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commercial templates may change both for the types of goods to which there is a demand and the way in which such goods are purchased (e.g. purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the machine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, it is possible to interrupt the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used in the organization of protection.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and objectives, including sources of contamination, risk factors, emerging homes and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as older age or chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise from the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of the response to the epidemic: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.</seg>
<seg id="18">The response is influenced by the seriousness of diseases in the community where business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health, for the grouping of such funds depending on efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the risk of COVID-19 is not possible, the most effective engineering and safety equipment is, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering equipment implies isolation of staff from risk-related places, and does not rely on an employee's behaviour, which can be the most cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action against an employee or a staff member.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal protection funds (PPE) are considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal protection funds should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, approach the size (e.g. respirators), be used permanently and properly, regularly check, maintain in due condition and replace as necessary, as well as correctly remove, cleanse and stored or recycle in order to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The U.S. Occupational Health and Industrial Health Authority (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and thorough handwriting of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respiratory etiquette, including the closure of mouth with cough and sneezing, the provision of napkins and containers for garbage, the readiness for remote or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The rapid identification and isolation of persons who can potentially be infected is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until the heat, the absence of an increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-resistant funds or other medicines that remove symptoms, and prescribe flexibility to policies on hospital sheets, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and to ensure that employees are aware of such policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, middle-risk positions require frequent and close contacts at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there are no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19, but there is a possibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the territory where business is located, or in connection with the recent visits of such a person to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="30">Such categories include workers with public contact, for example in schools, working environments with high population density and some major retail stores. The engineering and safety equipment for such groups and groups at higher risk includes the installation of high-performance air filters, the increase in ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include recommendations to sick workers to remain at home, to replace personal communication meetings with virtual means, to establish replacement schedules, to discontinue non-critical trips to COVID-19, to develop communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for responding to concerns, to provide up-to-date training for COVID-19 and protective workers, to train workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, to correctly use such funds, to provide resources and working environments that contribute to personal hygiene, the requirement of regular hand washing, restriction of access to the workplace by clients and the public, the placement of information signs on the need to wash hands and other COVID-19. Depending on the working tasks, employees with a level of risk may be required to wear personal protective equipment, including in combinations, including gloves, bathrobes, screen or mask for the person or protective glasses.</seg>
<seg id="31">In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may be required to carry respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">If a person is ill in an airplane, such measures as isolation of a person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, provision of sick mask or treatment to a person with a request to cover the nose and mouth of the napkins in cough or sneezing are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">The gloves used and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleared and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, the safety measures include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and the immediate information of the medical centre on the ship if there is a heat or other symptoms on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, the medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends that short-term closures be held for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a minimum or medium prevalence of infection in the community, social distances, for example, the abolition of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or good singing, cooking in cafeteria, increased distance between parks, time of arrival and care, restriction of non-essential visits, use of a separate location of health facilities for children with influenza symptoms, can be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="37">At significant rates of distribution in the local community, in addition to social disturbances, measures for prolonged schooling may be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, direct health risks are considered low, according to CDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">Law enforcement officials, who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, are encouraged to follow the same instructions as are prescribed by ambulances, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the event of close contact during the detention, workers must cleanse and disintegrate their uniforms and equipment prior to reuse by household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, abide by standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and recycle the personal protective equipment used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk posts include medical care, support, laboratory staff and medical transport in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">They have a very high risk of infection in their procedures, accompanied by aerosol formation, or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or sampling of invasive methods.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk mergers include those involved in the processing of persons with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 contamination at the time of their death; if such staff members are exposed, they are classified as very high. Additional engineering tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated premises for patients with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.</seg>
<seg id="45">In some health-care institutions and morgues, a special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Probents should be treated in accordance with the precautions provided for the level of biological safety 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be distributed into delineated waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators to work at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with a confirmed disease or suspicion of contamination of SARS-CoV-2, as well as persons conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the U.S. approved NIOSH respirators for the face with the N95 filter or higher class should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which specifies the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide more efficient protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted to respiratory rather than physiological fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">WHO recommends that only surgical masks for screening personnel be used at the patient reception point.</seg>
<seg id="51">Individuals who collect breathing tract samples in COVID-19 or vectors of this disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, WHO recommends that surgical mask, protective glasses or protective screen for a person, bathrobe and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">In procedures accompanied by an aerosol formation, the N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of surgical mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the insufficient availability of individual protection funds around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such remedies by using remote medicine, physical barriers, so transparent windows, ensuring access to the patient contaminated with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, only personal protective equipment that are necessary for a particular task, prolonged use of the same respirator, without removing, when working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection and recommendations not to use masks for persons who do not have symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday the total number of coronavirus infection cases SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.</seg>
<seg id="3">At least 52 thousand people died from coronavirus COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rubeen came on the same day when the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and in Zambia the first case of death from coronavirus was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="5">North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it had been one of the few countries in which coronavirus infection had not been reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed contamination, including 793,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were recorded, of which at least 5,900 had a lethal outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include feeling of fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and stomach pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most cases are lung symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions had been recorded, more than 153,000 people had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly distributed in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops emitted into the air at cough, sneezing or conversation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although these drops are formed in exhalation, they usually pose a threat to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at large distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People are also contaminated with contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the surface of the virus can live within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is most contagious for the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although its distribution can be possible both before symptoms and later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymer chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (RT PCR) on a sample taken as stroke from nose.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of disease, as well as to those who take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations on the use of medical masks by the population differ: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, while others require it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Local distribution of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infected persons may not have symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficult breathing, constant pain or surrender in breast, confusion of consciousness, difficulties in awakening, the sitting of a person or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical care should be immediately sought.</seg>
<seg id="18">The symptoms of upper respiratory tract diseases, such as sneezing, nose or pain in the throat, can be observed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, in different percentage ratios, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some cases of diseases registered in China have initially been manifested only by the feeling of breastfeeding and heartbreaking.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease can progress, developing in pneumonia, polyorganic failure, and eventually death occurs.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called an incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5 per cent of people are symptoms of symptoms for 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, the symptoms are not manifested in all infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still fully unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The percentage of infected persons with asymptomatic diseases is currently unknown, it is only being studied; Korean control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="27">The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily summary from 1 April; out of 166 cases of contamination reported on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.</seg>
<seg id="28">And wet, and saliva can have a greater concentration of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a loud speech, more drops are distinguished in the air than in the case of normal volume.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore showed that in the open cough, drops could be extended to 4.5 metres (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has assumed that the transfer of particles of the bio-aerosol virus is still possible, and air testing, processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the rooms of people, has shown the presence of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cordial resuscitation (SLR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and thus spreading the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus can spread through faeces, nevertheless, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible and the symptoms, but this risk is small.</seg>
<seg id="34">Employees of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easy the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient usually contaminates 2–3 others. The virus can survive on the surface from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus was able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and by 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and detergents with the right use have a rather useful effect in terms of combating contamination: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in a way, and can eliminate it from the skin surfaces and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions, such as petrol and chlorhexidine gluconat (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus. In a study carried out in Hong Kong, the samples of saliva were taken on average two days after hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="39">Five of the six patients first showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Heavy acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ukhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in konavirus kinship.</seg>
<seg id="42">Being out of the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which reveals its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected with the source SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">Light is the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates into hostage cells through angiotenzine-resistant enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar cells of light type II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrates into the hostage cell with the characteristic surface glycol protein - "wip" (performer).</seg>
<seg id="45">12 per cent of infected people in the Ukhan Hospital were diagnosed with severe myocardial damage, which is more common in severe form of disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to a systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progress of the disease, but the acute damage to myocardium can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">The ACE2 receivers are present in the heart in large quantities, as they participate in this body.</seg>
<seg id="48">The high frequency of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombobolia (25%) was observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19, and can indicate unfavourable forecasts. Autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19, showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics to ACE2-expressing epithelial respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 are experiencing symptoms of system hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, it was found that the pathogenic GM-KSF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes emitting IL-6 and heavy pathology of lung patients in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="51">The lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected.</seg>
<seg id="52">WHO also published several test protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Real-time polymer chain reaction (RT PCR) is a standard test method.</seg>
<seg id="54">The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a stroke of nose nose, but can also be used by a sample of a stroke from the nose or wet.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at an interval of two weeks and their results are not of direct importance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have managed to highlight coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests by polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As at 4 April 2020 tests on antibodies that could reveal the infection at the current time, as well as the possible contamination in the past, were under development, but have not yet been widely disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chinese experience of studying data results showed that their accuracy is only 60–70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test for diagnosis on the spot, allowing its application at the end of this month. The diagnostic instructions issued by the Zhongnan Huhan University Hospital indicate the methods of detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral multidimensional sub-pleural focus of the type of “matt glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution is frequent symptoms identified at an early stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">The noble dominance, the symptom of the boulevard bridge (hard thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and the consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">The microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 have little data.</seg>
<seg id="64">Main results of pathological study carried out at the opening:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: playground, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs</seg>
<seg id="66">There are four types of gravity of viral pneumonia:</seg>
<seg id="67">light shape of pneumonia: swelling of lungs, hyperplasia pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, intertial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory plass syndrome (RVC) and heavy hypocsemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and lungs interconnected fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intra-vascular curtailment (VAV-syndrome); leukoeritroblastic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding human places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mercury with flashing hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nose napkins with cough or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkins, to cover the mouth and nose inside the elbow of the hand area.</seg>
<seg id="74">After cough or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out high-quality hygienic procedure for hands.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Centre for the Control and Prevention of D morbidity (CDC) recommends that tissue facial masks be used in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic diseases. Social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; in these measures, schools and enterprises have been closed, the movement of citizens has been limited and large public events have been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="76">Recommendations for distancing also imply that people should be at a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.</seg>
<seg id="77">Medicines with confirmed efficiency against COVID-19 do not exist. Since the completion of the vaccine is not expected before 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as “to the plateau”.</seg>
<seg id="78">CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hands of hands, as well as before food and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol-containing (spirit content - not less than 60%) means of hand processing, but only when soap and water is not available. Regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two formulas for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">This composition uses ethanol or propagandal, with antimicrobial activity.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial controversy in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for anti-septic hand treatment.</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.</seg>
<seg id="83">Patients are shown supporting therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital bodies affected.</seg>
<seg id="84">CDC recommends those who suspect that infected with the virus, wear a normal medical mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">The extracorporal membrane oxygenation (EMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still being studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">In order to strengthen immunity, the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supporting methods of therapy can be shown to patients with light symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for patient care hospitalized with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the U.S. doctors intensive care and pulmonologists generalized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource — IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="90">For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend a choice in favour of paracetamol (acetaminofen) compared to ibuprogen.</seg>
<seg id="91">In the course of the procedures in which air and drip emissions may occur, such as intubation or drying of hands, precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="92">Medical workers caring for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends to be placed in an air and drip cell (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contacts and air. CDC has issued recommendations on the use of personal protection (SIZ) tools during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended personal protective equipment: protective bathrobe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. It is preferable to use respirators and not medical masks from the above means.</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial conditions, but FDA allowed the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency permit for use (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when using not effective efficiency in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="96">If medical masks are inaccessible, the CDC recommends the use of protective personal screens or, at least, to make masks independently at home.</seg>
<seg id="97">In most cases, the flow of COVID-19 is not severe enough to require artificial lung ventilation or its alternative, but there is a certain percentage of cases where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">The type of respiratory support for hospitalized respiratory patients associated with COVID-19, is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by nasal oxygen cannaly with intense air flow or two-tier positive pressure in respiratory tract.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition are as effective as IVL.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some physicians opt for invasive mechanical lung ventilation if it is available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal cannons with intense air flow. The risk of severe form of disease for older persons (those who over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) are much higher.</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are lacking, and health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in COVID-19 infections in a severe form requiring hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care departments, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for lung ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19, eventually enter the resuscitation.</seg>
<seg id="104">The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is complicated, as acute respiratory dumps syndrome (ARDS), developing under COVID-19, and oxygenation entail more problems.</seg>
<seg id="105">IWL with pressure support in the breath and MAC is necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen in light and to ensure minimal damage to the ventilation, which can result in pneumorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">On earlier models of fans high MAC can be inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research of potential treatments began in January 2020, and at the moment several anti-virus drugs are in the stage of clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">The most promising belt is presented.</seg>
<seg id="109">The development of new medicines can last until 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Anti-virus drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.</seg>
<seg id="111">The volunteers recommended by WHO participate in the testing of the efficiency and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconstructive plasma as an experimental treatment when human life is threatened by a serious or immediate danger.</seg>
<seg id="112">Its application has not been subjected to clinical research, which should be carried out to prove the security and effectiveness of the treatment method.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">To login, users must enter their name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The application can detect “close contact” with the help of observation data and, consequently, determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Analysts of large data collected from mobile phones, recognition technology, tracking mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons with whom they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor these mobile phones, which were allegedly contaminated by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="119">Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, it provided the Federal State institutions of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Russia, the technology of recognition of persons was introduced in order to identify violators of quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="122">The Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galler said that cellular network operators report that “40% of people still continue to move across the territory”.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour programme marathon for the weekend, which has been attended by more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">The President of Estonia, Kerst Kalluella, also called for creative solutions against the distribution of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience stress in connection with quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or because of fear of the infection itself.</seg>
<seg id="126">BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Strengthened social exclusion, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic downturn — the ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being of people.”</seg>
<seg id="127">Disease can take place in an easy form with minor or missing symptoms reminiscent of other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as ordinary cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Patients with easy form of disease recover usually for two weeks, while for treatment patients with severe or critical forms may require three to six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="129">Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such COVID-19 data. Some COVID-19 people can affect light and pneumonia as complications.</seg>
<seg id="130">Individuals with the heaviest COVID-19 disease can quickly progress in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as heart problems, kidneys and liver.</seg>
<seg id="132">The anomalies of thromboeing, especially the increase in anti-tombine time, were described by 6 per cent of patients enrolled in a hospital with COVID-19, while the disruption of kidney function is observed in 4 per cent of this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20–30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transminasis).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between the emergence of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care department was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to studies of cases at an early stage, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women 1.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="138">Gistopathological studies of posthumous lung samples testify to diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromosoidsoids in both light.</seg>
<seg id="139">The pneumocytes observed viral cytopathic changes.</seg>
<seg id="140">The appearance of the light resembled acute respiratory plass syndrome (LDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8 per cent of deaths recorded by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart problems were to raise the level of tropospin or heart stop.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Mortality estimates vary according to regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">Insufficiently effective counting of cases in lightly could lead to an overstatement of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that death occurs as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Smokers heavy COVID-19 symptoms developed in general by 1.4 times more often, and such patients were about 2.4 times more often needed intensive care or died compared to non-smoking. Concerns were expressed about the impact of the disease in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="147">The administration of one of Hong Kong clinics found that some patients recovering from the disease had decreased by 20–30 per cent and their scanning had found damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">After recovery it can also lead to a syndrome "After intensive therapy".</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from virus had been subjected to persistent immunity against him.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the current coronavirus, this is considered probable, but it was also reported when after the recovery from COVID-19 tests on coronavirus were still positive.</seg>
<seg id="151">It is believed that there has been a worsening protracted course of disease rather than re-infection in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transfer from humans to a person.</seg>
<seg id="154">The study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.</seg>
<seg id="155">According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">All figures vary depending on the region and the time of spreading the disease, they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time from the beginning of the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO assigned an emergency code to the CIC-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 – for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV- 2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and cases of contamination is 6.9 per cent (1538,222/2 240 191).</seg>
<seg id="160">This figure varies from region to region. Some other methods include the identification of a mortality rate as a result of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not linked to specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain layer of the population from the moment of contamination before the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have suffered infection, the presence of such antibodies can be understood how many people have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="163">In the epicentre of flash in Italy, Castilion d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600 people, 80 people (1.7%) no longer live.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German health system has not been overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood indicators.</seg>
<seg id="167">COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.</seg>
<seg id="170">The greatest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced only from the age of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be a genetic and behavioural factor.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender immunological differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, associated diseases in men (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than women) can be a cause of higher mortality among men.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57 per cent of infected men were men and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were for men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="176">Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ODS have different gender statistics.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, with a better chance of contracting.</seg>
<seg id="178">On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease — COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebrais, explains: “CO” means “crown”, “VI” – “virus”, “D” – “disease” (disease), and 19 years, when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">Such a name was chosen to avoid references to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the name aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called heavy acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In public communications, WHO further uses the terms “ COVID-19” and “virus responsible for COVID-19”.</seg>
<seg id="182">And the disease, and the virus itself is usually called "Konovirus".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Ukhan, China, the virus and the disease usually called “Konovirus” and “hanqan coronavirus”.</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical places in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “respiratory disease of 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020 official names – “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to the limits of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as pads to take strokes from the nose, as well as parts of the IVL apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="187">In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, then one of the local production was re-profiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the first outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet began to spread at high speed to various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects.</seg>
<seg id="189">Probably, people can infected with the virus of other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chicks.</seg>
<seg id="191">At the moment, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or medicines for its treatment.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are currently conducting various international research on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims to assess the treatment effect of four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate-candidate drugs.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 penetrates into the human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous SARS-CoV studies are used in scientific developments.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three vaccination strategies.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers seek to create a whole-viron vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is intended to trigger a quick immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy, the creation of a single vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying S-shapid protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine methodology).</seg>
<seg id="202">Pilot vaccines developed on any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. Antibodiesavimo has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="205">The drugs approved for malaria treatment were estimated at seven tests, four of these studies were hydroxyl chlorochlorine or chlorohine.</seg>
<seg id="206">The re-profiling of anti-virus drugs is most of the Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III on craftsmen have been carried out in several countries.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19. For the same purpose, several other existing anti-virus drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including handicrafts, chlorophysi and hydroxyl chloroxide, stovinavir / rhetoric, as well as stovinavir / rhetoric combined with interferon beta, are also considered.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, there were preliminary data on the efficiency of the use of the craftsman.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving craftsmen as an exception.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III of clinical trials is already taking place in the USA, China and Italy. The use of chlorine, previously used for malaria treatment, was considered in China in February 2020, and there are preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">Korea and China’s health authorities recommend the use of chlorophysi.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose in one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="214">On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for the use of hydroxyl chlorochlorine and chlorine at the discretion of doctors attending COVID-19. In the Chinese instructions, the 7th edition also indicates interferon, ribavirin or hyphenovir, as a means of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribbirin are necessary for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">Nitaszanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor ACE2 it is necessary to reconcile protein of a tip of the transmembrane prote prosthesis of serial 2 (TMPRSS2).</seg>
<seg id="217">Research on the use of chlorine and hydroxyl chlorochlorine with or without azitromycin has serious restrictions that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without a more detailed study. The lakes do not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="218">There may be hypercytocytemia as complications at late stages of heavy COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There are evidence of the fact that hydroxyl chloride can possess hypercytocype properties. As a result of a small study by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation for crown treatment was included in the quotation.</seg>
<seg id="220">This drug has reached the 2nd stage of an unidentified test, which is held at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained in patients with severe form of disease.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combined with the analysis of blood serum on ferrite to detect cytocaine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, FDA was approved by an antagonist of interlukin-6 on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokines syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there are no randomized and controlled evidence that the currentism is an effective means of treating cytokines syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="224">The transfer of peeled and concentrated antibodies produced by patients’ immune systems recovering from COVID-19, people who need them are currently seen as an incarnated passive immunization method.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results were unconvincing.</seg>
<seg id="226">The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibodies therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms, such as antibod independent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be used.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are at the development stage.</seg>
<seg id="229">The use of reconstructive blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of recoverable patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shops in Australia limit the number of packages to toilet paper that can be purchased at one time</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday night Australian shops of Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of packaging paper, which can be purchased at one time in all the country's stores, up to two and one packaging respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday ALDI also introduced a restriction on one package.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions were reported in the box offices, as well as on the Facebook network page.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency reserves due to fears that COVID-19 can lead to the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number of 4 packages.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Coles trading network in its press release of March 8 reported that with the introduction of the restriction on four packages “in many shops toilets are still too fast — one delivery for an hour”, and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI in Facebook, published on Tuesday, called such a trend “unexpected”.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the representative of Woolworths, last week there was a sharp increase in sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Costco shop in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to fill the deficit, Coles began to order larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made reserves for a special promotion of early sales on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Tsimmermann, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to replenish stocks, but it was hampered by the restrictions on the travel of trucks.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects to increase the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet the demand, but at the same time there are fewer profitable offers.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday ALDI announced that due to the depletion of reserves some shops cannot hold actions on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="15">In News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retailer from Queensland University of Technology, said that shops are replenishing reserves every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that the toilet paper is a cumbersome goods, so the number of warehouses is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods long series of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of reserves.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and such goods as rolls of toilet paper and disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not become so panic,” says Russell Timmermann.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last Wednesday the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced the end of the stocks.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the company-manufacturer of the Kleenex toilet paper and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they work 24 hours a day to provide sufficient quantity of goods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Domain.com, the real estate sale site, said that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the lack of buyers during the Day of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began to offer the first participants of auctions free toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fourth edition of the NT News daily publication, which was printed in Darwin, included the eight-page tab for cutting and use as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the ABC Australia report of March 3, first shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of goods purchased, claiming that they do not plan to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Tsimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks disinfectants for hands, galanantery, hand washing and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was observed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper by two packages on 12 rolls.</seg>

<seg id="4">DATA/VAVELATION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">DEVELOPMENT: CC0: Protected rights are not available</seg>
<seg id="6">This month we live in unusual circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shed light on the relationship between people around the world and our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have not had precedents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperation and community development around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have seen friendly and caring relations among all our colleagues, which has been reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chat — a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.</seg>
<seg id="10">I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week I was informed about the high assessment of our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was reminded of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.</seg>
<seg id="13">And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it be to ensure the efficiency of sites, to pay for our colleagues or to protect community security.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="15">At a time to achieve meaningful results for peace, it is important not only that we are doing, but also as we do.</seg>
<seg id="16">In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, beginning on the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjusting the order of our work and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As was previously said by Robin, the “c-team” team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The overwhelming majority of us wanted to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to retreat, let it be so.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all staff, contractors and freelancers:</seg>
<seg id="23">According to our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, it is allowed for the purposes of our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to take care of relatives, to acquire food products or to go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority number one.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not follow your working time.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are ill, you should not work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is understandable and undoubtedly, but we mention it.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is not necessary to decorate a hospital sheet or a cancellation: just inform your manager and help the team to reconsider the calendar and schedule of work to ensure coverage of key areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you have a confirmed COVID-19, report Brian from T&amp;C Ops to enable T&amp;C to provide support and due attention from management to your situation).</seg>
<seg id="31">Payment rates will be made in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to comply with the obligations to our contractors and staff with an hourly payment rate.</seg>
<seg id="33">Everyone will receive payment according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you cannot work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people use the work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do can bring amazing results, especially in such times.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, it is a self-help.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we may know what to expect and could adjust your actions accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some types of work are considered significant.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must always support such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&amp;Safety and Fundraising commands are critical work for which additional support may be required.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will initiate a process for all units to assess the current goals and shift the emphasis on support, which is essential for our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">The slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to work “two more to make up for the missed” after the pandemic has ended.</seg>
<seg id="47">You will not need to work overtime to meet unreal deadlines for the current time.</seg>
<seg id="48">We recognize that the circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timetables, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens to APP (annual plans)?</seg>
<seg id="50">To adjust to a new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.</seg>
<seg id="51">We intend to propose an extension of the deadlines for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the formation of the budget, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for close, and at the same time to all those who need or who want to work, a short schedule for the next few weeks will be provided.</seg>
<seg id="52">Such an extension of the timing allows for a significant reduction in the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, reporting to representatives and teams up-to-date information on the following steps immediately after confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank you to the APP team for the leading role in such work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Condition of office, risks and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in addition to the many precautions, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disintegrate all surfaces in the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used antiviral medical solutions for the disintegration of all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevators, through which access to our floor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="59">The building uses its own rules to comply with caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our office in Columbia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in DC with its COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our old colleagues, working remotely, know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is recommended that the duration of meetings be limited to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If you need longer sessions, consider how to split them into a course of several days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send the materials for consultation in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">By default, use video communication, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.</seg>
<seg id="71">For ease of reference, assign the coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as responsible for the conduct of notes (or a joint summary).</seg>
<seg id="72">If necessary, please contact the technical support service by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your advantages under the Wellness Re abovesement program when purchasing snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Connect to #remoties in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR Operations team examines the ergonomic manuals available in the format of webinars to promote the efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">We understand and report that our requests for such repeals and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.</seg>
<seg id="78">Next week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.</seg>
<seg id="79">Universal sentiment in the global community is not only a grief for interrupting work, but also a sense of relief in connection with mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.</seg>
<seg id="80">As for the prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and communication.</seg>
<seg id="81">We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting, which will be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.</seg>
<seg id="83">This time we will take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together by connecting to each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We together in such a situation are ready to help everyone than we can.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can still receive information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information on COVID-19 is from Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="88">If there are questions about travel, events, key working stream, information problems or other assistance, please contact CRT.</seg>
<seg id="89">We stand ready to support and link as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have confidentiality problems, please e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">No such changes should be seen as renunciation of our work and our obligations.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable the continuation of work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary service.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will wait for appropriate times.</seg>
<seg id="95">Today, the time has come to support each other and to create space for important work that will be forthcoming in future weeks and perhaps months.</seg>
<seg id="96">In order for this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum return as soon as there is such a need.</seg>
<seg id="97">And now, please, help your hands and do not touch your face!</seg>

<seg id="1">Diagnostic criteria for “suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 should be updated</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on the experience we have gained and the verified recommendations on combating this pandemic around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and cited the latest diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which now has an official name for coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), was launched, and the virus disease itself was called “heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On 11 March 2020 WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group developed a brief reference manual and published it on the Internet on the website of the Military Medical Research 6 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">This publication attracted great attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the document “Recommendations on the diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were issued and the content of some of its provisions changed significantly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) co-sponsored comments on our recommendations. They contained simple proposals for diagnosis based on already existing clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as provided valuable background information on the pandemic covering the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="13">We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to the latest issue of “Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (trial seventh version) and on the results of current research, and their work needs to be updated.</seg>
<seg id="15">In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (from 3 March 2020) to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspicion of disease, it is necessary to combine one element from the characteristics of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or residence in Wuhan and its surroundings or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases have been registered within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or other settlements where COVID-19 cases have been registered over the past 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered for 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, class, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on the suspicion of a disease with the presence of one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the PCR test in real time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-generational sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to new crowns; (3) positive results of serotete for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or changing the result of the test with negative to the specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgG, or increasing the titra at least 4 times on the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator for the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) the issues of the document were added to the PCR test in real time for nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pathogenic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) productions; and then the seventh issue was added the need for serological evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the results of continuous work of researchers engaged in searching for an optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in fast diagnosis, as well as for analysis of samples taken from respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and promotes the inclusion of positive tests of tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, there is growing evidence about the need to be cautious in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, the route card presented in Zhou (Zhou et al.,) should be updated, as there are persons without clinical symptoms classified as a group of low risk.</seg>
<seg id="24">The evaluation system also requires clarification of further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">With regard to the diagnosis of “cases of suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations, which are given in those countries where they live.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Research of Diseases (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases had entered the reported infections, as well as 33 patients who had been at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the online briefing, the director of IEDCR Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Mirjabi, two died over 60 years of age, two at the age of 51 to 60 years, and one at the age of 41–50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also reported that two victims had been killed by Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">A staff member of the clinic told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was in the treatment of the Kuwaiti Clinic at Maytri.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladeshi Obaidul Kwader said that the work of public transport will be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The work of public transport was stopped from 26 March and was to resume on Saturday, 4 April.</seg>
<seg id="13">The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — has still been resolved.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first cases of COVID-19 contamination were recorded in Bangladeshi on 8 March, two people who returned from Italy as well as a wife of one of them.</seg>

<seg id="1">The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of infectious disease COVID-19, caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the term “pandemic” characterizes only the extent of the disease, rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take measures:</seg>
<seg id="4">“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”</seg>
<seg id="5">This is possible if countries are involved in identifying, testing, treating, isolating the sick, tracking the occurrence of diseases, and mobilizing their citizens,” the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebrais, explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of proliferation and the seriousness of the disease, and the alarming level of inaction.”</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Thoma Frieden, former Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said in his interview, broadcast by CNN in February, that “no other respiratory virus except influenza has yet been tracked since its inception to continuous global distribution”.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Gebrazus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronary.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have also never seen the pandemics that can be controlled before.”</seg>
<seg id="11">First, in January, WHO declared an outbreak of this emergency in the area of public health, which was of international importance, and then granted it a new status — the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the USA, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, so called out the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, further will be worse.”</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 COVID-19, more than 4,600 people died in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that identify the presence of the virus and antibodies detection methods in response to the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OT PCR, which recognizes RNA coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific and designed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to confirm recent or active infections.</seg>
<seg id="5">Detection of antibodies (series) can be used for both diagnosis and popular control.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibodies analysts reveal the number of people who suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to deal with them, or were absent at all.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact mortality rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, there were no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was very controversial.</seg>
<seg id="10">Differences in the information are likely to have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which in some countries can be significantly exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the help of polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) test can be carried out on samples from respiratory tract, obtained in various ways, including strokes made of nose or a sample of wet.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are usually available for a period of several hours up to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The OT-PCR test carried out at the strokes taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">In infected patients, tested in the second week of the disease, material from lower respiratory tract with the help of a suction boater can be taken as an alternative, or it is possible to use products of thinning (wet).</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharay Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets, which subsequently distributed the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020 the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It reveals the gene “E”, common to all beta konoviruses, and gene RdRp, specific for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to obtain the permission of the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 detection set on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) distribute through the International Reagent Resource diagnostic panel for RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the three genetic tests from older versions of test sets gave incomplete results due to marriages and narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully successfully processed throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The testing was approved by the Food and Medicine Supervision Authority as part of an emergency application for application. U.S. commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PCR throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics started testing on COVID-19 across the country since March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions have been made; the extraction and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology “VEKTOR”.</seg>
<seg id="26">On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020 the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020 Roche Diagnostics received the approval of FDA for the use of a test that can be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, which allows one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for the use of (EUA) laboratories Abbott for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously FDA issued such a resolution Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020 Cepheid also gets EUA from FDA to a test of about 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="29">FDA also approved a test in which the technology of amplification of insulated nucleic acids instead of PCR is used.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the test does not require a series of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using monoclonal antibodies is currently being developed in Taiwan, which is linked in a specific way to nucleocapidal protein (N-white) of a new coronary, and there is hope for results in 15-20 minutes, like an express flu test.</seg>
<seg id="32">The review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “the tortoise of the chest has a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of KT [computer tomography] may be of value even before symptoms occur.”</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral multidimensional sub-left focus on the type of “matt glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">The corporate dominance, the symptom of the boulevard and the consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">The results of the study, which compares the methods of PCR and KT, used in Ukhan at the time of the current pandemic, showed that the CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020, the initial CDC screening recommends the use of the PCR method.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct popular control. Analyzes can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosis on site (PoCT)</seg>
<seg id="39">In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="41">When PoCT is one blood sample, usually get through a puncture of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike the methods of PCR, the stage of blood fence for taking a penetration analysis is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA called 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibodies tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency permit test. At the end of March 2020 Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits for the use of their test sets, which can identify antibodies of IgG and IgA in blood samples with the ability to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="44">The productivity of testing is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR-analysis of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies can usually be identified in 14 days after infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of its antibodies to analyze antibodies provided satisfactory results.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion to stay at home with suspicion: “the staff of the emergency department provide the patient with a tube for the sample”, the patient pushes into it, gives back and after a while the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection with the patient of other visitors of clinics, or the need to disintegrate the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. In the course of express testing on COVID-19, in suspicious cases, the medical worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most large-scale testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Mandatory Health Insurance Physicians stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could only have 10,700 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the President of the Robert Koh Institute, Germany’s total performance in testing is 160,000 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of 19 March, express testing had been proposed in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests surrendered in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="52">The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2 was taken a total of at least 483 295 analyses, up to a week of 12/2020, inclusive, and 339,491 (6,9%) the result was positive. Researchers of Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested the method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. On February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters for the detection of emergency cases called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese, or Ognenne Eye), which can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in only 5 days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory was not put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the occurrence of the disease in Hubae would be 47% more, and consequently the costs of quarantine would also be twice as high.</seg>
<seg id="54">The opening of the laboratory in Ukhan immediately opened the laboratories of Juo Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity of the bandwidth was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays diagrams have been released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, due to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, it was problematic for mass testing in the EU, Great Britain and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result, some authors appealed to test samples of test samples, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes for the purpose of releasing RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the coronavirus test, which was currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita, exceeded any other country, and the majority of the population would soon be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was due to the possibility of express testing, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and BGI a laboratory of mass testing of the population (created on the basis of their laboratories to detect emergency cases of Juo Yan in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">This laboratory, launched in 14 days, is able to hold tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests on the day and is the world's first laboratory so large, working outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Various testing options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States sanitary and epidemiological centres was inaccessible to 28 January, resulting in a lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, problems were raised with the reliability of test sets, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient numbers recommended by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">And here in South Korea, as experts argue, wide availability of testing helped to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">For several years, the South Korean Government has worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19. As a result of the increase in demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many private US laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overburdened and the stock of strokes and chemical reagents was quickly depleted.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">American test kits developed by CDC had “deficiencies”, and for that reason the government had eliminated bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests of tests. Spain acquired test sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these sets were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explained that the reason for inaccuracy of the results could be unsuccessful fence of samples or misuse of sets.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will withdraw sets that produce inaccurate results and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80% of test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China, gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China were also found inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovich proposed to reset them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, argued that the test sets acquired in China had a “high level of mistakes” and the Ministry “not to use them”. United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test sets in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these sets were unsuitable for use.</seg>
<seg id="71">Quarantine measures for persons whose tests have yielded a positive result on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring people with whom patients have contacted, have had positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy died a person from COVID-19, held two cycles of testing of the entire population, with about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of the people with a positive result did not have symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed on quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="74">Entry into the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the context of intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures of the crown coronavirus 2020 in Singapore, there were much less tense in Singapore than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops did not have to be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions were less aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="78">The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries that do not have resources for mass testing as well as national laboratories with limited COVID-19, to send their first five positive and first ten negative analyses of COVID-19 tests in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The next schedule of the column “% positive results” depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.</seg>
<seg id="82">The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, other equal conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapidly growing cumulative morbidity rate (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative morbidity of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / the European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Taking into account Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care departments need to improve the preparedness of COVID-19, which will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of an unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the 2nd type (SARS-CoV-2), was the agent of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has begun to call coronavirus infection (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 are in easy form, i.e. in the form of a respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop in a heavier disease with the need for hospitalization, and the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, is approximately 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">This study examines the trends in cumulative COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) country/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Eurosurveillance magazine of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria by which WHO determines the existence of a disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020 — all three returned from Wuhan Province of Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="17">As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatals, accounted for only Italy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative COVID-19 morbidity</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) is currently updating data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministries of Health of these countries, national and regional health and WHO governments.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data are used to analyse the trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with Italy data.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, a truncated cumulative COVID-19 disease was calculated for 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared to the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">Trends in the development of cumulative cumulative COVID-19 per 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were in line with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">The cumulative COVID-19 morbidity in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to grow approximately on 21 February and a sharp leap of this indicator occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK noted similar trends in the cumulative COVID-19 cumulative disease (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows a cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to a similar indicator for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the amount recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable speed in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19, including “filling” testing.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care departments in these regions are already most filled.</seg>
<seg id="33">To date, data on the receipt of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases (data are not provided respectively).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, there is a need for a systematic collection of such information in order to complement the current monitoring data, the subject of which is the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units for 100,000 population in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 presents the scenarios for modeling the boot models of health systems with estimates of hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK when the risk of lack of affordable beds in intensive care departments exceeds 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since the cases are currently grouped into certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care departments usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care departments is recommended to the extent possible to provide units of the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care departments should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 contact contamination scenario, which has long been unrelenting, and an increase in the number of COVID-19, in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, the operational, pre-emptive and integrated approach, followed by a transition from deterrence to minimization of consequences, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, accept and adjust their responses, if not in advance, are important.</seg>
<seg id="42">The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Countries have only a small period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zone of human crowns</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutting and adaptation have stimulated coronavirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for millennia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, it was known that two human corones (HCoV) were causing light disease, such as ordinary cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and dangerous can be the contamination of human coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again drew attention to coronavirus and surprised us with high transfer, but more pronounced pathogenicity of the virus compared to the sister virus SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">Coronavirus human infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zonosis origin will be very useful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most crowns of humans come from bats for which they are not pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="8">intermediate tanks of some human coronaviruses are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The definition of carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study of the interaction of animals that are caravirus carriers can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we provide available data on seven human corones, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonosis and inter-species.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human corones in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, today's epidemic of the disease caused by coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, there are conditions necessary for successful change of carriers, and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coronaviruses refer to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar thread of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome with a genome containing 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides have been called because of their shape, which in the electronic microscope resembles the crown.</seg>
<seg id="17">From the point of view of the structure, coronavirus contain unregulated genomes with an identical organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two major openly overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in the polystyrenes of pp1a and pp1ab.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polystyrenes are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including a spidal protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleopro protein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">In other lines, coronavirus is also encoded by a number of lines of pro-security cessation proteins.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the basis of the differences in the sequences of protein, the crown is divided into four species (alpha-, beta, gamma and deltaconavirus), while the type of betaoconavirus includes most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betaocoronavirus are bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltaconavirus.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of crowns have constantly overcome inter-specific barriers, and some have evolved to dangerous pathogens to humans.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven human corones are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="27">The remaining five betaocoronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, crown of hard acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome of the second type SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light shape, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in relatively larger patients with higher probability of acute respiratory disease (ORS) and extracurricular symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first thread of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from the sample of the nasal-divided patients, ill with cold in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause symptoms of local infection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human crown infection was considered to be generally harmless.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; over 8,000 people were disrupted and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with sporadic disease spreading sporadicly to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The new human coronavirus discovered in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is an exciting disease of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected exceeded 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">An alarming signal is received and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven human coronaries have zonosis origin, their sources are bats, mice or pets.</seg>
<seg id="38">Numerous sets of data show in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human corones from bats, whose organisms have been well adapted and in which pathogens, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.</seg>
<seg id="40">A study of the zoonosis mechanism of origin of human coronavirus will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">Perhaps it will also tell or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying media SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of the disease in the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">This review contains general information on zonosis origin, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we denote and consider the following general feature: the baseline viruses from which human corones occurred, usually not pathogens for their reservoir media, but acquire pathogenic character after the inter-width transmission to the new medium.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also analyze the tendency of evolution of human coronavirus, according to which the increase in transfer is often accompanied by weakening of pathogenic properties.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="46">The coronists of animals are known from the end of the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first derived from the model separated from the nose of patients ill with cold, various coronaviruses found different infected animals, including in the deed, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Seven human corones have been identified in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="49">Table 1 informs informatively and clearly a brief history of discovery of human corones in chronological order.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious top respiratory tract lesions in 1966; in the future, this virus has adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and throat pain, while high temperature and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was allocated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brain of mice-suns.</seg>
<seg id="53">Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus look similar to the HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza virus A and rhinocerus.</seg>
<seg id="54">And the HCoV-229E virus, and the HCoV-OC43 virus have widespread spread in the world and are usually transmitted in winter to moderate latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="55">The incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two-week disease.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a normal cold form.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.</seg>
<seg id="58">The outbreak of SARS, also known as the “epidemic of atypical pneumonia”, was the first in the history of mankind to have a well-documented pandemic caused by human coronavirus, and the pathogen of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human corones.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of diseases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and on different continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">Excluding the sparkling spreaders, it was estimated that each disease could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">In patients infected with SARS-CoV, muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general malaise and chills, and among later symptoms were caused by breath, cough and respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="63">Extensive deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm at SARS are lymphoids, disorders in liver samples and increased levels of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="64">In patients with SARS there are also diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increase of macrophages.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20–30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation of lungs.</seg>
<seg id="66">In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs may also be infected, including gastrointestinal tract bodies, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by cytocaine storm, which may be lethal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">For the first time, the virus was allocated from an open biopsy of the sick relative of the patient, who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, tremendous efforts have been directed towards research into human corones.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was first found that it was mainly affected by young children, older persons and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, characteristic of us, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis are characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study describes the same virus from the rear material taken from the 8-month boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of diseases caused by it occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 connects with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a circle.</seg>
<seg id="76">HCoV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolith.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 connects with the aggravation of asthmatic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="78">Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1, which causes respiratory diseases of light shape, revealed all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="79">All of these four corones of man, causing out-of-hospital infections, have well adapted to people, and their mutation, entailing high-pathogenic diseases, usually unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in the rare example of a more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Usually, acquiring the ability to effectively be transferred and preserved in the human body, these human corones become less viral or pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="81">Coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first allocated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from an easy 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Most laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, imported cases and spreading through occasional secondary infections in close contacts were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — for both infections is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronavirus, transmitted to the person.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4 per cent) were registered, so MERS-CoV is considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to man.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the period from mid- until the end of December 2019, in Wuhan of the Chinese province of Hubbei, patients with pneumonia pneumonia were identified, now looking back at the infection caused by coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome of the 2nd type (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization has announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency and the disease itself has been called “Konovirus infection 19” (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="90">As of 3 March 2020, 9,053 confirmed cases had been registered in the world, with mortality accounting for approximately 3.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="91">It should be noted that mortality in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent outside its borders.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2, like coronavirus SARS and MERS, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by rising temperature, cough and breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also have diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly move into acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of philogenetic wood.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection has been recorded, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">As a result of comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronaries, important similarities and differences are identified.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the coronary-transferred crown has a similar incubation period and the duration of the diseases they cause.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronaries.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, according to the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms, there is between SARS-CoV and four human crowns causing out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to the fact that most often occur when human corones are contaminated, causing out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, light symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, as with the infection of SARS-CoV, a small subgroup of heavy COVID-19, although the ratio here is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also notes interesting patterns, characteristic of both human crowns and out-of-hospital infections, and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is at least the same as the human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other human crowns causing out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in calam samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have yet to answer the question of whether the faecal and oral path of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">Of particular interest is the issue of the possible season of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human corones, causing out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="110">Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transfer, pathogeneity and sustainable distribution after the transition through people.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four human corones, causing out-of-hospital infections with symptoms of light shape, have well adapted to people.</seg>
<seg id="112">On the other hand, it may be well adapted to these four human coronaries.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human crowns in the past.</seg>
<seg id="114">Human crowns, causing severe diseases in people, and people who have human corones cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="115">In order for this to happen, human corones must be replicated in the human body enough to accumulate adaptive mutations counteracting the factors of restricting the media.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 will last and the more people are infected, the more chance that the virus is fully adapted to the person.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other control of infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four out-of-hospital crowns have been circulating among the population, causing ordinary colds in people with healthy immunity.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require an animal-reserve.</seg>
<seg id="120">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV high-togenic coronaviruses have not adapted to man well, and their transmission to people cannot be supported.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to be preserved and multiplied in their zoo reservoirs and to look for cases of entering receptive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or amplifiers.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has features such as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least now.</seg>
<seg id="124">But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it adapts completely to man and will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir media of HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="127">Animal is an evolutionary bearer of HCoV if it transfers a close ancestor with the same high homology at the level of sequence of nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="128">The pre-purpose virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.</seg>
<seg id="129">Likewise, the hostel is constantly transporting HCoV for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, natural carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or his parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV was only entered in the intermediate media right before or about the time when it was entered man, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate media can serve as a zoonosis source of human infection and play a role as an amplifying medium, allowing the virus to be lightningly replicated, and then by transmitting it to people, increasing the scale of infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can move the impasse if it fails to withstand the transmission of inside the intermediate medium.</seg>
<seg id="134">On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even set long endemic.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero patient of SARS had contact with hunting-field animals (dies).</seg>
<seg id="137">Further studies of seroprovalence have shown that animal traders have the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus higher than the population as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="138">The Himalayan crowds (Paguma larvata) and the tape dog on the markets of live animals have become the first installed carriers of viruses like and almost identical SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the cotton in the markets, SARS was no longer reported.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civic, living in nature or on farms and did not enter markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined to conclude that the Himalayan civicists could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing medium, not a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is noteworthy that since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is impossible to exclude the probability that intermediate amplifiers can also serve numerous small mammals.</seg>
<seg id="142">All of them seem deadly carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="143">The subsequent search of the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed the nearest CoV volatile mice, which called associated with the atypical pneumonia coronavirus of the bats of the bats of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese submarines of volatile mice.</seg>
<seg id="144">These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other crowns of volatile mice have 88–92% of the same homologist of sequences of nucleotide, which is SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that volatile mice have become carriers of new human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">The volatile mice also revealed several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV), but none of them, except one, which denotes WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">It is known that the receptor of SARS-CoV is a human Aniotenzine-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</seg>
<seg id="149">It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of feces of bats, uses ACE2 bats, civic and man as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, serum recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 presents the closest native ancestor of SARS-CoV at volatile mice, dividing 95% of homology of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Despite the high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parental virus SARS-CoV, and volatile mice are not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Philogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 volatile mice, and CoV-HKU5 bats.</seg>
<seg id="154">CoV-HKU4 volatile mice and MERS-CoV use the same receptor of medium, diptydipeptidez-4 (DPP4), for penetration of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="155">The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA-polymer-polymer virus MERS-CoV philogenetically closer to the sequences of betaocoronavirus of volatile mice identified in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, the wild volatile mice have not found the live virus MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="157">The homogeneity of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 volatile mice coincides only with 87%.</seg>
<seg id="158">That is, volatile mice could not be a direct reservoir of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-year camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies, specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus detected in people, was allocated from the bulk strokes of one-hour camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true reservoir carriers MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It should also be noted that the camels, experimentally contaminated with MERS-CoV, observed minor symptoms, but massive viral separation.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels have distinguished the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by faecal and oral paths, which is also the main way to disburse the virus in bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, there are still issues, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have no contact with camels in the history of the occurrence of symptoms and plausiblely refer to the transfer from human person or transfer to unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals, which are carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The homology of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides by 96.2% coincides with CoV RaTG13 bats, allocated for Asian submarines Rhinolophus affinis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute to them parental relations.</seg>
<seg id="166">That is, volatile mice could not be a direct reservoir carrier SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical crowns of bats are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the immediate SARS-CoV-2 carriers should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale market of seafood, which has been associated with many initial COVID-19, which indicates the likely possibility of transferring from an animal to an animal.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies on the basis of methagene sequence have concluded that the group of threatened small mammals, known as Panis javanica, could also transfer parentalacoconavirus, sister SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">The homology of the sequences of nucleotides of these new genomes of coronavirus pangolins by 85–92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also close to RaTG13, and the identity at the level of nucleotide sequences is about 90%.</seg>
<seg id="171">They are clustered into two authentication of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, in the philogenic tree, one of which is a receptor-connecting domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with identical sequences of amino acids at 9 97.4%.</seg>
<seg id="172">Quite the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 SARS strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences in the entire genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">In an earlier study of patients with pangolins, the definition of viral continents in lung samples was also reported, which were similar to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a sequence of genome, including about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">It cannot be ruled out that pangoline has become one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 carriers.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and betaocoronaviruses, sister SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betaocoronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in volatile mice, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="179">While the highest homogeneity of sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and betaocoronaviruses of pangolines, sister SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 the highest homogeneity of sequences in the whole genome.</seg>
<seg id="180">Very theoretically, the high degree of likeness between betacoronaviruses of pangolines, sister SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is connected with parallel evolution through selectivity.</seg>
<seg id="181">The opposite offer advocates recombination between betaocoronavirus Panollinov, sister SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="182">As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betaoconavirus.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is still no final decision on SARS-CoV-2 zoonosis.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the high-pathogenic viruses, HCoV is also studied by the zoonosis origin of viruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</seg>
<seg id="185">Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E may occur from coronavirus volatile mice, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been detected in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">It was reported that coronavirus of bats, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected from the North American three-color suction cup, demonstrates close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically associated with another crown of volatile mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate carrier could be camel.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of famous coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Philogenetic analysis gave evidence of the events of the inter-species transmission of HCoV in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="190">When about 1890 there was an inter-specific transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus and people infected with pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of the inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is not as clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Alphacoronaviruses of bats were found, close HCoV-229E.</seg>
<seg id="193">There is alphacoronavirus alpakius between them.</seg>
<seg id="194">Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to man.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, it is people, not the alpaca, that could contact the flying mice in the general ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, alphacoronavirus of volatile mice, kinship HCoV-229E, in volatile mice are diverse and non-pathogens, while alphacoronavirus alpaki caused an attack of a respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alphacoronavirus alpaki was not found at wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alpacaconavirus, the related HCoV-229E, from people, should be alphabetical.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, volatile mice are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that volatile mice could directly transfer to people HCoV-229E.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while alphacoronaviruses of volatile mice could serve as a gene pool of the HCoV-229E virus, alpaca and one camel could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people exactly as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of inter-width transmission from bats of one-fold camels and from one camel to man.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from volatile mice is known for its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.</seg>
<seg id="205">Obviously, volatile mice give a rich pool of varieties of viruses for inter-species gene fragmentation and inter-width transmission.</seg>
<seg id="206">For a long time, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly to the flying mice "ideal spreaders".</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by a single camel decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="208">He has adapted well to these camels, which have turned into a stable and natural reservoir medium from the intermediate medium.</seg>
<seg id="209">In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very light disease and is characterized by relatively low mutations.</seg>
<seg id="210">His episodic transfer to man is an accident, and the person remains a stalemate MERS-CoV, as his transmission is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transfer, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, betaocoronaviruses of pangolins are high-pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They can be stalemate bearers of betaoconavirus, sister SARS-CoV-2, as well as quotes in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, there is a need to confirm or exclude several opportunities for inter-species of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, volatile mice can be a reservoir medium for the virus, related SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">People can share environmental niche with volatile mice thanks to coal production or cutting of carcases of these animals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolines can be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which the sister SARS-CoV-2 virus hit recently.</seg>
<seg id="218">People are infected with the virus through the cutting of carcases and the consumption of wildlife meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">It is quite possible that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to many animals, including home.</seg>
<seg id="220">The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.</seg>
<seg id="221">Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in the third form, which has contacted both volatile mice and pangolines.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for an animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of carriers, three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the intersection of inter-specific barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their relatively high speed of mutations in replication of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other viruses with single-parent RNA, the estimated rate of coronavirusov's mutations can be considered "moderately-high" with an average frequency of approximately 10–4 replacement per year on one plot, depending on the phase of the crown adaptation to new owners.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have corrective exodibonucleus, the removal of which leads to extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirusov thanks to the inhibiting of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymer.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remesivir is one of the most promising funds against SARS-CoV-2, which must be checked during clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the medium.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared to SARS-CoV with high frequency of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to people.</seg>
<seg id="232">This virus has already been adapted to another carrier close to man.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to one-year camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic drift.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the large genome of RNA in coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with regard to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-vidual co-evolution, favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses with appropriate conditions.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and the functions of proteins encoded in the direction of the 3′-con end of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism of choosing a matrix, coronavirus randomly and often switch the matrices during the replication of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="238">During the transcription of DNA coronavirus in the medium, which serves as a mixing vessel, the threads often occur.</seg>
<seg id="239">High-logical full-size and subgenogenic RNAs can recombine and create new crowns.</seg>
<seg id="240">Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was discovered both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animals of coronavirus, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.</seg>
<seg id="241">Interaction of the virus — the carrier in relation to the transfer</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the receptor is another key factor important for inter-specific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">This article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates the evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-species transmission, is recombinated by SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the basis of a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV strains and the civic, the SARS-CoV is considered to be fast adaptation in different media, especially with regard to the mutations of the S. S.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RSB protein S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the response of the antibodies of the medium intensely selects it.</seg>
<seg id="246">SARS-CoV is amino acids, from 318th to 510th, on a fragment S1, which is associated with an angiotenzperformer enzyme 2 (APF2) for the introduction of the virus in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="247">The SARS-CoV PCB is able to recognize APF2 receptors of different animals, including flying mouse, civic, mouse and tape dog, making the virus transmission of the virus possible.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differ from the human strains of humans and civic, and 4 of them are in the prescription motivation for interaction with the receptor of APF.2</seg>
<seg id="249">SARS-CoV matches have a mutation of K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spidal protein with the human receptor of APF.2</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to the person.</seg>
<seg id="251">It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference in 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein segment leads to the fact that the connecting protein protein S to the human APF2 could change.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study with the help of a cryo-electronic microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between APF2 of the person and protein SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other couplers were required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with APF2 but with another protein segment S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many other HCoV receptors such as the N for HCoV-229E aminopeptide and 9-O-Acetyalic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these crowns in people after inter-width transmission from carriers.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the inter-vidual HCoV transmission is also controlled by other dependency factors and restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="259">The divergence of these proteins carriers between people and natural reservoir carriers HCoVs, such as bats, single camels and rodents, can be a barrier for inter-width transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">Successful inter-width transmission to HCoV viruses accounts for usurping dependence factors and subordinating the factors of cutting carriers.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and bearer still need to be defined and categorized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Good results can give an impartial full-generation screening of dependence factors and stretching media for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.</seg>
<seg id="263">emergence of new HCoV: back to zero mark</seg>
<seg id="264">The variety of crowns of volatile mice creates wide opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, crowns of volatile mice serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential for radical modification of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important to adapt to people, as the viruses of volatile mice, kinship SARS-CoV were isolated, but it is established that they encode ORF8 divergent proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">29 nukleotide, characteristic of coronavirus SARS-CoV, was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="270">This case split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and consider it an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gammaicorus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been defined in RNA-dependent RNA-Polymage.</seg>
<seg id="272">The localization of recombination was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Likewise, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic was recombinated between different lines, which occurred in a single camel in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoV, in which HCoV recombinated with other animals coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is likely to occur as a result of the elimination of the virus from the breeding pressures, such as the immune system of the media.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to bicycle deed.</seg>
<seg id="277">While the intact open frame of ORF4 reading can be observed in the viruses of flying mouse and camel, kinship HCoV-229E, alphaconavirus alpaki demonstrates a single-tide insertion, which leads to a shift in the frame.</seg>
<seg id="278">Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to pressure selection on their reservoir media.</seg>
<seg id="279">With the contamination of bats, coronaviruses were registered with pronounced symptoms or their absence, which speaks of mutual adaptation between coronavirus and volatile mice.</seg>
<seg id="280">It turned out that volatile mice are anatomically and physiologically adapted to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, the defects of activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the volatile mice effectively reduce pathology caused by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural activity of murderer cells in volatile mice is suppressed by the April of the inhibitor receptor of natural cells of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main complex of histocompatibility I class.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high level of active oxygen shapes, which is provided by high metabolic activity of volatile mice, can suppress the replication of coronavirus, while influencing the reading of exoribonuklease, thus creating pressure to generate strains of the virus, which when penetrating into the new media turn out to be high-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the media.</seg>
<seg id="285">Thus, it is no coincidence that there have been three new crowns of man over the past twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="286">Crowns of non-pathogens or cause light symptoms of their reservoir media, such as bats or camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They are surely replicated, without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and that causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Heavy symptoms are mainly related to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokino storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the defeat of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="290">On the contrary, the impotent carriers of immune response do not involve a replication of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of non-acquisition of immune response can have favorable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">At volatile mice, the interferonic answer is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Thus, the admission of the I type, at least in the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in people should have a favorable effect.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the volatile mice disrupted the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma.</seg>
<seg id="295">On the basis of this inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a common scheme for which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have arisen.</seg>
<seg id="297">While the betaicoronavirus of bats was found, the nucleotide homology of which 95% coincides with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of volatile mice, the nucleotide homology of which coincides with 96% with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although it was found that the matches and other animals in the markets transport viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate media for SARS-CoV-2 were not installed.</seg>
<seg id="299">B betacoronaviruses of pangoline were discovered, astonishingly homogeneous SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolines could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that the fragments of the genes of betaocoronavirus Panollinov could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a person.</seg>
<seg id="301">Crowns have attracted universal attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronavirus at volatile mice and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonosis and animal-reserve-reserves HCoV in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from volatile mice and have been handed over to man through intermediate carriers.</seg>
<seg id="304">If SARS-CoV’s infection comes from contact between people and civic in markets, the closure of game markets and the destruction of a cotton on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of betaocoronavirus pangolines, the nearest SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoo transmission from food markets, should remove pangolines.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolines and other mammals and how this can be the task of future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in a single camel.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels combined with other infectious control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes causing outbreaks of disease may occur.</seg>
<seg id="313">The world circulates a variety of zonosis coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, crowns of volatile mice with zonosis potential are extremely diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonosis coronavirus, which in the future will lead to new crowns, which are easier to pass and (or) more deadly for a person.</seg>
<seg id="316">In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between people and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="317">After harsh tests, such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best willingness and response plan to such situations is needed.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of seizure of new territories has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although many properties of volatile mice are favorable for spreading viruses, if teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with volatile mice and other species of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="321">In order to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural media, there is a need for constant epidemiological supervision of mammals, which will be useful to prevent the transfer of coronavirus from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.</seg>
<seg id="322">In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to hold people away from environmental niches of natural reservoirs of zoonosis viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the puzzle of zoonosis origin SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if the volatile mice handed over the pre-war virus SARS-CoV-2 Panolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the volatile mice and pangolins share the same environmental niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if flying mice play a more direct role in transferring to a person, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with volatile mice.</seg>
<seg id="326">Thirdly, if the third mammals play a true intermediate medium, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including pets, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a flying mouse, pangoline or other mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be determined by their natural carriers.</seg>
<seg id="329">Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 people.</seg>
