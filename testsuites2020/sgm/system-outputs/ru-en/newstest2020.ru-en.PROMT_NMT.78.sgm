<seg id="1">Applications are COVID-19 mobile phone software applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several contact tracking applications have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This has created a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Milder options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based support functionality into their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government, together with Alipay, has deployed an application that allows citizens to check whether they communicated with people infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore the application under the name TraceTogether is used.</seg>
<seg id="9">The application was developed by local IT companies, has open source code and will be transferred to government control. North Macedonia has launched the Bluetooth-powered StopKorona! app, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking application was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications on the basis of the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozoning function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by only a small portion of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications in the App Store to include only "official" or other reliable organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of oversight.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by limitation clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">The use of data should be limited to combating the proliferation of COVID-19;</seg>
<seg id="23">The security and anonymity of data should be protected and evidence of such security provided;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance should exclude instances of increased discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the legal level;</seg>
<seg id="26">protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">there should be "meaningful participation" of all "relevant stakeholders," including public health experts and representatives of marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their terms and conditions lists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to solve the problem of ongoing surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as this is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="29">In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, which eliminates the need to download the application and the ability to avoid tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all central server systems must have access to personal location data; A number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers for communication only (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="35">The government not only used this information to alert citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made information about the location publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes in information protection legislation that were introduced after the outbreak of MERS in this country.</seg>
<seg id="36">Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidentiality systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.</seg>
<seg id="38">Contact tracking, in which confidentiality is maintained, is an established concept, a significant amount of research literature on which dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user's approach to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that involve both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons take place on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group, the MIT Media Lab, is developing SoundPaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location or path crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work of this platform is based on the research provided in the document "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SoundTrace platform, originally developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy company that developed media technology.</seg>
<seg id="43">SoundTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was founded by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, the goal of which is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and alerting, which is a key factor in their wide distribution.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the source code for the SoundTrace used in its official application.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allows privacy.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Deployment of tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data confidentiality</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance by first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as "hand hygiene," is the process of cleaning hands to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose or mouth (that is, the mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the buttocks of the child or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, as well as before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after cooking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After shrieking, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main medical goal of hand washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as from chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This procedure is especially important for people who are cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,</seg>
<seg id="16">and reduces infant mortality at home.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by assimilating simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases may be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARI), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the main cause of under-five mortality, which kills approximately 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children every year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing can lead to itching and peeling of the skin - a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Too frequent hand washing may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the buttocks of a child (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cursing, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, the procedure for washing hands with soap is quite little common.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that for an average of 38.7% of families, washing hands with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; The United States in this list is closer to the middle, their figure is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China - 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand-washing of schoolchildren at a given time of day is one of these methodologies that helps to train children in such a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Philippine Department of Education's Emergency Medical Program is an example of large-scale efforts to improve child health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">This national program is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.</seg>
<seg id="36">The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during washing.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins that are components of organic contaminants are poorly soluble in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sufficient water, however, contributes to the purification process.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to reusable use, can also contain bacteria that can get onto it in previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies on the entry of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap into the skin suggests a low probability of such entry, since the bacteria wash off with foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still states that "hand-dispenser liquid soap is the preferred hand-washing option."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant agents has a selective effect on organisms that have antibiotic resistance in nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective for antibacterial soap, their efficacy may not match that advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to the surfactant and skin protection agents, the complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other perfumes (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosan.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soap water is more effective than cold water to remove natural fats that contain contaminants and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late nineties and at the beginning of the 21st century began to gain popularity of means for hygiene of hands on a spirit basis, not containing water (also known as hand sanitizers on a spirit basis, antiseptics for disinfection of hands or sanitayzer).</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these agents are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing convenience of use of these agents and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis wand, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% bacteria (logarithm contraction 3.5 similar to reduction by 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% - 99.999% bacteria (logarithm contraction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent must be used to thoroughly treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="60">The front and rear surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends opting for hand washing rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="62">The increase in popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for full washing of hands if it is possible to use water and soap.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain emollients and/or skin moisturizers.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emollients to the formulation of the agent.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollient components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants practically do not occur.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants over soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Despite its effectiveness, water-free agents do not clean hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, since pathogenic microorganisms still remain on hand when such agents are used.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of hand disinfectant containing no alcohol is largely dependent on the components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol containing agents.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, it has been proven that preparations using benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity in contrast to alcohol, which has been proven to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, this can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution upon contact with water.</seg>
<seg id="76">If soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="77">To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of a hand washing technique, including the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water just does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just one water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="82">Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Friction helps remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you are a third of your hands, the more microbes are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Rinsing hands in standing water can provoke re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="86">Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted. Most often, people leave out areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="90">If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle pumpkin with holes made and/or using ash if necessary, as, for example, happens in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions such as foot pedal cranes and other low-cost options exist.</seg>
<seg id="91">A foot pedal crane is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed to pour water on the hands; a piece of soap should be used.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Wipes and Towels was conducted by the University of Westminster in London; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygienicity of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern airflow hand dryers.</seg>
<seg id="95">It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average increased by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">It also turned out that after washing and drying the hands in an airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average decreases to 76%, and on the palms - to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environment at each type of drying.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet-air dryer, which releases air at the stated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms from the hands and from its own block and potentially infect other users of the toilet room and bathroom in a radius of up to 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">When paper towels were used, no significant spread of microorganisms was detected. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of drying hands.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the method of drying hands:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towel drying.</seg>
<seg id="103">Hand cleaning using disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution during travel without soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in inpatient conditions.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.</seg>
<seg id="107">According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying the hands, closing the crane, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, use a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="113">This avoids repeated contamination of the hands from these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">According to one study, proper hand washing and other elementary procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and handwashing procedure to be applied in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="117">The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="118">A corresponding review was conducted by Whitby co-authored.</seg>
<seg id="119">Commercial devices can be used to measure performance and check hand hygiene if compliance is required.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization refers to "five moments" when you need to wash your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">after contact with blood or biological fluids,</seg>
<seg id="122">prior to use of antiseptic as well as</seg>
<seg id="123">after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps destroy bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such antibacterial properties may be required prior to surgery or in a high antibiotic-resistant environment. To "clean" the hands before surgery, a crane is required that can be turned on and off without touching it with hands; some chlorhexidine or iodine water should also be used for hand rinsing, sterile hand drying towels after washing, a sterile friction brush and other sterile nail cleaning tools.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is not necessary to rub hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="128">During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing is completed, the hands are dried with sterile tissue and a surgical robe is put on.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use hand antiseptic before and after care procedures for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="131">To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the first 20% of washing was found to be most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were gained when hand washing rates were increased by more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap leads to a more than three-fold increase in the incidence of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of hand wiping with an alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol hand solutions in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A virus on the hands H1N1 and Clostridium diffatile spores. Measures to develop hand hygiene in medical institutions may include training staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, as well as written and oral reminders to staff to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in various health facilities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important means to improve health and even digestion.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill the habit of washing hands regularly.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to arrange hand-washing in such places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and stimulating hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="140">To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results need to be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based sanitation and epidemic surveillance was effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of propaganda regarding hand washing in schools is the Three Star Approach approach of the United Nations Children's Fund: it promotes the implementation of simple cost-effective measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands using soap, as well as other hygienic requirements.</seg>
<seg id="142">By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">The installation of hand-handlers is one of the possible measures implemented as part of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis symbolizing hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="145">Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with the DALYs indicator (preserved years of life without disability).</seg>
<seg id="146">However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, Nurse of Modern Nursing "</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasmas.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections related to the provision of medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, in Germany, posters with "the right hand washing techniques" were hung next to the handmakers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "wash your hands" means a manifestation of your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a participant in something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; subsequently, this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to involuntarily wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she herself committed and prompted her husband to commit.</seg>
<seg id="155">It was also found that people who recalled or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often compared to other people, and for them handmaids are more important.</seg>
<seg id="156">It is also less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they saw will participate in any other "cleansing" compensating activities, for example, volunteer activities.</seg>
<seg id="157">In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after visiting the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was a tragedy for mankind: at the moment, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is characterized by a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.</seg>
<seg id="5">We look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holiday of spring (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given the high degree of similarity with coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 called this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the concomitant disease - coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified, more than 40,000 patients recovered, more than 3,000 patients died.</seg>
<seg id="11">WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy to society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications about COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a range of patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review is an attempt to summarize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), an outbreak of which occurred in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the facts known at the moment about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of total respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, we have faced highly pathogenic human coronaviruses twice this century, that is, a coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, which caused an outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with a terrifying level of severity of the disease and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Fig. 1.1, a report of clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of transmitting the virus from humans to humans.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, quarantine was introduced in Wuhan, urban public transport stopped working.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak was a global public health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already reached approximately 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2) .2</seg>
<seg id="28">Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, according to the results of a multicenter clinical study, which involved 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the next updated picture of the development of the epidemic was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but people aged 30 to 65 years were mainly ill.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="32">The infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0,31/100,000) than among women (0,27/100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei province and in nearby regions.</seg>
<seg id="34">On average, 5 (2-9) days passed from the moment of symptoms of COVID-19 to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">From symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transport traffic on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mortality among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe cases of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one strand of sense RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the case of SARS and MERS type coronaviruses, the glycoprotein of the shell spine-like processes (S) binds to the cell receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme of type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles that then merge with the cell membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% identical with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease at the Huangan seafood market in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Genetically SARS-CoV-2 closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">By means of transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients a disease of lesser severity than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play some role in terms of virus pathogenicity and suppress IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full-length enzyme &amp;lt;unk&amp;gt; human with a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with an amino acid transporter &amp;lt;unk&amp;gt;.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in recognizing the coronavirus and its infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civet and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By means of a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were found to be the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it remains unknown which species has become an intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the path of transmission is also yet to be elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr. Ji (Ji) and colleagues suggested that snakes became vectors of the virus from bats to humans, during which homologous recombination occurred in the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-winged mammals that feed on ants and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the difference of 1% distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is believed that definitive results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block the activity of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, there is no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can refer only to earlier researches of other coronaviruses, first of all SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).</seg>
<seg id="70">As a rule, a virus that enters the host's body first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ORPs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.</seg>
<seg id="71">Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which restrain the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">T helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to aid protective cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have disorders of the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a variation of 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A later study described above, based on demographics of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the timing of the quarantine measures introduced to take into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="87">The general practice was 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or were infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, for example, dry coughing, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients had shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of chest images.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptom prevalence rates: 98% - high temperature, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="95">Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of MERS-CoV patients whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher proportion of MERS mortality than from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).</seg>
<seg id="98">The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial ventilation of the lungs requires 14-20% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.</seg>
<seg id="100">Compared to this figure, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by symptom presentation, mortality rate and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above indicators indicate a higher spreading capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower compared to the last two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, it will be much harder to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within the same family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found themselves together on any transport, for example on a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or were in contact with infected or diseased patients for the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, having been discharged from the hospital, can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.</seg>
<seg id="109">At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, in 1,099 patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia with a white blood cell level &amp;lt; 4 × 109/L was established, including with a white blood cell level &amp;lt; 1 × 109/L, as well as an increased level of asparagine-aminotransferase and virusemia.</seg>
<seg id="111">In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell subsidence were observed.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">In most patients with COVID-19, chest radiographic examination found pathologies characterized by uneven blackouts on both sides or "matte glass "-type blackouts in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop SARS, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory disease (ARI).</seg>
<seg id="115">With the development of ORZ, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, the worst results of radiographic examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes and intercutaneous lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ORZ and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="119">As the main criterion in diagnosing COVID-19, the method of detecting RNA SARS-CoV-2 through polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, given the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020, China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.</seg>
<seg id="122">Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiographic results.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR repetition, to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows you to identify synthetic RNA fragments SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without using complex equipment.</seg>
<seg id="124">This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and their convenience.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in countering a previously unknown coronavirus, physicians are mainly able to provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2) .2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressors, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and the provision of psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and also possibly to a lesser extent affects other organs expressing ACE2, for example, the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, disruption and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease course.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functions of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="134">The cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the isolation of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge number of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of ORZ and multi-organ insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="137">In the treatment of cytokine storm, particularly in patients in serious condition, immune suppression is essential.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat cytokine storm.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other methods of treating cytokine storm based on immune suppression include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of a yanus-kinase; application of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone deacetalase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressors.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids at high dosages do not benefit in the treatment of severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">In contrast, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impair prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids in small to medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with critical COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, turned out to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola viruses and Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-stranded RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Relying on this data, Gilead provided this drug formulation to China to conduct paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interactions of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be monitored with caution.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production</seg>
<seg id="153">Blood sampling in patients cured of a contagious disease has been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="154">And indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat the pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and address them.</seg>
<seg id="156">On the basis of this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, to suggest massively using this method before carrying out specific therapy, no verification and no explanation are required so far.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some of the disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine ejection syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in a critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome the global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against the virus's critical proteins.</seg>
<seg id="164">So we can move immediately to mass production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">For thousands of years, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, since it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy COVID-19 Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces of China, in which Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only approximately 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of recovery was recorded (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a fairly rough comparison, since the assessment should take into account a variety of other factors of influence, for example, the number of patients and the severity of their disease.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively from Western medicine and combination treatment from Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the timing of normalizing body temperature, removing symptoms and providing medical care in hospital settings was noticeably less in patients for whom a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques was used than in patients who were treated only by Western techniques.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to worsen (mild to severe), was markedly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in the group treated only by Western techniques (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is also of particular interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques or combinations thereof.</seg>
<seg id="177">Patients who suspect or confirm the presence of COVID-19 mostly have a strong fear of an acute contagious and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as all other people who require it.</seg>
<seg id="182">As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal carriers and infected individuals to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Work has been done to develop S-protein based vaccines that aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Animal studies have developed live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, prior to clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines under natural conditions when applied to age-related patients, the pattern of deadly doses of infection, and the degree of protection against infection by zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="187">Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="188">At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to appear, emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.</seg>
<seg id="189">To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunities is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the raging epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, there are serious difficulties due to the long duration (on average 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="192">Being a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high rate of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease course.</seg>
<seg id="195">In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on data from clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may affect or become associated with prognosis of disease course in patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of SARS virus disease, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the data of the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (an average of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: infection SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher than among women (0,31/100,000 versus 0,27/100,000), as mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Incidence and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial injury and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver disruption in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age and baseline diseases are closely related and can distort the results.</seg>
<seg id="205">Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It has also been proposed to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase can also predict the result.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: in order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, the data of a radiographic examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressants widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.</seg>
<seg id="212">Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be administered in low dosages and short courses.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As described above, against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, since they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be provided.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to differ in its features from the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower airways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper airways and cause mild symptoms or not at all at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, leading their usual lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which makes epidemiological control significantly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients are seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, today's epidemic COVID-19 far more severe than the SARS epidemic, and is more difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently doing a lot of work, which has announced a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 virus distribution chain.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures cause enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients identified is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="223">According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the attenuation phase will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, compiled a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the virus could SARS-CoV-2 hit two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, the decrease in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategies may have had an effect.</seg>
<seg id="229">Initial projections suggest that Ebola should have hit up to a million people and killed half a million patients.</seg>
<seg id="230">But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually taken under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infection capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or turn into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">The virus is SARS-CoV-2 characterized by a high transmission rate through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus was also found in feces, which means that an oral-fecal method of transmission is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="235">According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who are in contact with patients or infected.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both surgical masks and Grade N95 (Series # 1860s) respiratory agents help control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent microdroplets of liquid from potentially infected from scattering in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only masks of class N95 (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (series # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health professionals should wear a shaped protective gown to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, the doctor became infected SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he wore a class N95 mask; perhaps the virus entered his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed type safety glasses.</seg>
<seg id="245">It is strongly recommended that the entire population in affected or potentially threatened regions wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave the house with self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">An acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a meter.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, its high degree of similarity with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, was supposed to be an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiosity and limited reproduction during transmission from person to person and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially as the entire country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitude and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from physicians and officials; (3) take stronger action to contain a potential epidemic early in its development, rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly check and improve society's response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 outbreak caused by a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began in late December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, the disease covered the whole of China and at the time of writing this document spread to 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a feeling of SARS recurrence in the COVID-19 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and the mortality rate among older persons are also higher than among young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">Mortality as a result of SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Some patients with COVID-19 can have negative usual tests on availability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">All this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Against the background of such fast advance of the researches COVID-19 remain not solved some major questions yet, namely:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite finding a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, for example, from bats to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Molecular-level simulations and biochemical samples have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus infiltrate airway cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it cause a global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically relapse like influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect that the vaccine against the virus would SARS-CoV-2 be obtained earlier than in 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research in its connection.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020 year, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the phase I security studies are:</seg>
<seg id="11">nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, iRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)</seg>
<seg id="13">According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more candidate vaccines were reported, but little publicly available information is available (presumably under planning or development).</seg>
<seg id="14">Stages I-II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and at the same time, side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed at early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still under preclinical research).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">On January 24, 2020, the University of Saskatchewan, Canada's International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterRac) announced the start of work on its own vaccine to begin testing in humans in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The start of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.</seg>
<seg id="20">On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Schuitmaker announced the start of work on the creation of their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against cancer neoantigen.</seg>
<seg id="24">On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of vaccine synthesis work and the start of trials.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to develop a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Support Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in western Maryland, announced that they are developing their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into partnerships with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">for vaccine development and production.</seg>
<seg id="31">The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="33">On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they created a particle similar to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="34">A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureRac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA vaccine; currently, the drug is undergoing preclinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive the results of preclinical trials, and their final vaccine candidate drug may begin to be tested in humans in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development is $29 million.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other CEPI investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different animal vaccine candidates.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of obtaining the sequence from China.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national "vaccine bank," which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020 researchers from Medical school of the University of Pittsburgh reported about testing of PittCoVacc, the possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, having said that "MNA entered the subunit vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong answers antigen - specific antibodies [in mice] which were shown in 2 weeks after immunization".</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">With bacteriophages, DNA will multiply within human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they may have other advantages in addition to the disease prevention properties.</seg>
<seg id="52">Another randomized trial, which is being conducted in Australia, involves 4,170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Perhaps the vaccines being developed will be unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain infection with a level of biosafety 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, no drugs or protective vaccine exist to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS was a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.</seg>
<seg id="58">When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the study of SARS, which was conducted at that time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that went through phase I of human clinical trials, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and under development, two were adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamRac) and one was MVA-vector (MVA-MA).</seg>
<seg id="60">A conspiracy theory spread on social networks, claiming that the virus COVID-19 not new at all, and that a vaccine against it already exists.</seg>
<seg id="61">Social media posts cited some patients who claimed to have patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">Protein ACE2 contains N-terminal peptidase domain М2 and C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid collectrin.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain enters the surface of lung cells and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extracellular domain is ACE2 cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar lung cells of type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Biosynthesis ACE2 iRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of the ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Aroh Val-Tir.</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Being a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causing virus).</seg>
<seg id="16">Strictly speaking, soldering of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with enzymatic domain ACE2 on a surface of cages leads protein S1 binding to an endotsitoz and a translocation both a virus, and enzyme in the endosom located in cages.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires priming the S protein with the serine protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and ARB inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published July 11, 2012, "ACE inhibitor use was associated with a significant 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared to controls."</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk by contracting pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory insufficiency syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure of 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising agent for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. The introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pandemic of coronavirus of 2019-2020 are the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus heavy sharp respiratory sindroma2 (SARS-CoV-2) taking place at the moment of time.</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing an estimated 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth with coughs, keeping the distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-isolation of people who suspect their infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's students.</seg>
<seg id="14">Misinformation about the virus began to spread on the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the virus spread.</seg>
<seg id="15">Reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported the occurrence of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was launched.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cases of infection were mainly associated with the Huanan wholesale seafood market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus bearing great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease arose on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after this date.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two-thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, in a publication by the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, the information of which was not verified, it was suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China decreased, but began to rise unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the many cases with mild symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">By February 26, relatively few infections were reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and younger accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected before the formation of effective group immunity in the country's population.</seg>
<seg id="23">Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested for COVID-19, and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, no country was able to test more than 3% of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that requires not to conduct testing for only minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on March 16 found that in China until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that such unregistered patients became the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">Statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infection (R0) by COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the rate could be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period was 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of those killed had comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on pandemic deaths COVID-19 usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results of testing for COVID performed according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since official figures may not take into account deceased people who have not been tested - for example, in the case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID figures by 4-5 times.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges, "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than actual." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. Such records with incomplete data are often found in pandemics, such as the swine flu epidemic of &amp;lt;unk&amp;gt; 2009. The first confirmed death was recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">All indicators vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease; they are also affected by testing volumes, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak of the disease, and population parameters such as age, sex, and overall health. The mortality/morbidity ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of infections diagnosed over a given time interval.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Data for different regions differ.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of mortality due to disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of mortality due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the effect of testing on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and the exact duration of the outbreak are not measurable and may differ depending on the location.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni, a fellow at Pennsylvania State University, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks typically go to the plateau, and then when the number of available disease carriers ends, they begin to go out.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen. "</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, claims that "everything could end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kuczarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate, perhaps for a year or two."</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a study conducted by Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more)," compliance with physical distancing measures and other measures will be required.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner, a fellow at Vanderbilt University, believes: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it is so easily transmitted," and also that it "can turn into a seasonal disease, flaring up every year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are elevated fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that it becomes ill in serious form with the development of respiratory problems of about one in six people.</seg>
<seg id="59">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling depressed in the chest, sudden sensation of confusion, difficulty awakening, and sinking of the face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and examination for infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from several units to 44% of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="62">The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is still no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing, or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">According to some studies in open coughing, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during conversation, which are able to remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets can also form during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.</seg>
<seg id="67">Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="72">There have been cases where tests proved positive when tested three days before symptoms appeared, and this suggests the possibility of virus transmission before symptoms manifested.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission of the disease from asymptomatic carriers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus is able to live up to three days, on the cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">These data, however, vary with humidity and temperature. In domestic and other animals, a positive result for COVID-19 was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people could touch.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first found in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 has a great resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is assumed that it is of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.</seg>
<seg id="82">At the holistic genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.</seg>
<seg id="84">A holistic genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computed tomography.</seg>
<seg id="86">The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease course processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnosis."</seg>
<seg id="88">WHO published several protocols for testing RNA for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of these was published on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) is tested.</seg>
<seg id="90">It can be carried out on respiratory samples and on blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually ready over a period of several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Usually, a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a pharyngeal smear may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to obtain approval for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Characteristic features of visualization of symptoms on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral clouds like matte glass and the absence of pleural effusions.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international database of confirmed infections.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identified, COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.</seg>
<seg id="98">In China, a major study was conducted comparing chest CT results and PCR testing, and it was found that although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decrypted faster; in addition, they are more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus using radiographs and computed tomography.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using wipes for coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many Governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading to the population, some of whose members do not know where or how they were infected. Health professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on developing solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data - for example, registering a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.</seg>
<seg id="107">If the user of the mobile phone was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives the corresponding notification. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">At the moment, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to create it.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after wrinkling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.</seg>
<seg id="112">In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants with an alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="113">WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (a disinfectant begins to act on the stainless steel surface a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other components such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or a day hospital, all spaces of such a room, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.</seg>
<seg id="117">Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or a napkin when coughing or sneezing and immediately discarding used hygiene items.</seg>
<seg id="118">Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that disperse in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.</seg>
<seg id="119">WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main way of infection." Masks are also recommended for use by those caring for people who may be infected.</seg>
<seg id="121">WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, persons who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask does reduce the number of touches to the face.</seg>
<seg id="122">Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing nonmedical fabric face masks. China separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.</seg>
<seg id="124">In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials urge people to make face fabric masks at home and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, the Government of Viet Nam asked all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government has obliged all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Government of Israel also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="130">On April 1, Taiwan, where ten million medical masks a day have been produced since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="131">In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when they go outside; those residents who cannot purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="132">Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.</seg>
<seg id="134">Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many regional Governments, particularly those affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distancing.</seg>
<seg id="137">The maximum number of people that can gather in one place according to the recommendation of US government bodies and health organizations was quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups including more than two people. Older people and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of getting the virus in serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home for as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the tent "social distancing" with "physical distancing," thus specifying the goal of this measure - to reduce physical contacts within the framework of social ties, whether through virtual communication or with physical distance.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the tent "social distancing" was understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">Among others, recommendations were made to have sexual intercourse only with your regular partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that it lacks the virus and its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended self-isolation at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health facilities have published detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">Individuals in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="144">Individuals who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.</seg>
<seg id="145">Strategies to control the outbreak include curbing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="146">Control of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and is aimed at tracking and isolating those infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.</seg>
<seg id="147">At a stage when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are aimed at mitigating the consequences: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdened health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks, and self-isolation; Public measures aimed at physical distance, such as school closures and the abolition of mass events; involving the community in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning. After the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, stronger actions were taken to contain the outbreak, such as isolating entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, and a system of warning about the movement of infected people was organized.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provided financial support to infected self-insulated individuals and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for accumulating excess supplies of medicines. Simulations across the UK and the US have shown that there are serious problems with mitigating (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (halting the growth of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are weakened.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not exist at the moment, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter cold medication, drinking enough fluid and resting can help relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration and respiratory support.</seg>
<seg id="162">Using steroid drugs can only hurt.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">WHO sees health capacity-building and adaptation to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="166">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to assist in the reallocation of resources at several levels. including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, abolishing non-urgent procedures, where possible, virus detection and isolation of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and expanding intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of available VIA devices and beds.</seg>
<seg id="167">There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could arise - the so-called "zero patient."</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of infection with a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">They were mainly associated with the Huangan wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus penetrated the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded in a clinic in Hubei province, with which a doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, on December 27 reporting this case to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Clinic warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising panic.</seg>
<seg id="173">Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="174">Wuhan health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway junction.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">According to later official data, by January 20, 2020, symptoms of the disease already appeared in 6,174 people. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million infections were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and territories recorded at least one reported case of infection.</seg>
<seg id="179">Due to the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen zone limited free movement and established border control.</seg>
<seg id="180">National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure rose to 2.6 billion - about a third of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the validity of the information of which was not verified, this date is November 17th.</seg>
<seg id="183">On December 26, doctor Zhang Jixian was working with a case of mass pneumonia of an unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianhan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">Primary genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="185">On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="186">WHO was notified on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for the "spread of rumors" about the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="188">Initially, the China National Health Commission claimed that there was "no clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called "people's war" by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping.</seg>
<seg id="190">The events of the "largest quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, on January 23 a sanitary cordon and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan were announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.</seg>
<seg id="191">The city banned the use of personal transport.</seg>
<seg id="192">In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were canceled.</seg>
<seg id="193">Authorities also announced the construction of the Huoshenshan Temporary Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also redesignated 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, as temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and schools were closed across the country.</seg>
<seg id="197">The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">In several regions of China, the authorities introduced a remote mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="200">The schedule of public transport was changed, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">In many cities, a regime for controlling the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case of domestic transmission was recorded in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted domestically was mainly stopped, and the outbreak in China was taken under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that from March 28, entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact dates for the cancellation of this order were not called.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.</seg>
<seg id="206">On March 30, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00, a national three-minute "minute silence" was held, which opened a day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distancing to avoid a re-outbreak of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">It was confirmed that the COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.</seg>
<seg id="208">On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the fact that a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji gathered in Daegu.</seg>
<seg id="209">Followers of Shincheonji arrived in Daegu from Wuhan, which, presumably, is the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, South Korea announced the highest level of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="211">On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed infections were recorded in Korea, and on February 29 this figure increased to 3,150.</seg>
<seg id="212">All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were confirmed to have the virus according to tests.</seg>
<seg id="213">The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore, the flight schedule of airlines was changed. South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons. The programme is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods included mandatory information about their symptoms through a mobile application by everyone coming from abroad, full-time testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the very next day, as well as expanding testing capabilities, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people daily.</seg>
<seg id="215">South Korea's program is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities did not isolate there. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the Government's inadequate response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, it was reported that South Korea recorded the lowest total number of infections in a single day for four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On 29 March, it was reported that all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks from 1 April.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries turned to South Korea for help in testing for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.</seg>
<seg id="221">The first measures introduced by the government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, plans were announced to limit long-distance travel, but intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.</seg>
<seg id="226">Against the backdrop of claims of a cover-up of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than 10 countries had linked cases of their disease to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">The Iranian parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, the results of testing for the virus were positive.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison leadership to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths within one day - the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.</seg>
<seg id="231">By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials died from this disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">By March 23, Iran recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran can be five times higher than the data that are reported at the official level.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="235">The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease fell into Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 performed in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of infections began to grow rapidly, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, placing more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy in quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entry and exit from the disease outbreak zone will be blocked.</seg>
<seg id="240">In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and cancel sports events. " On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since at that time 100 people had already been recorded in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were supposed to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9 all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for prioritizing care for patients that may need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of coronavirus mortality, ranking first in the world after announcing 3,405 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed coronavirus infections, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases in Italy, with the majority of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">One CNN report notes that such a high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors - a large number of senior citizens of this country and the inability to examine everyone who currently has coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="247">The United Kingdom responded most calmly to this virus from all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the country's population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending refraining from all trips and social contacts that are not of primary importance, inviting people to work from home if possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.</seg>
<seg id="249">On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, but no more than £2,500 a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced tougher measures for social distancing, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and restricting travel and outdoor activities only to cases of extreme necessity.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of clusters of people.</seg>
<seg id="251">Most enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide "vital activities of the population," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, household stores, gas stations and garages.</seg>

<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Despite this, population testing in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was hidden.</seg>
<seg id="257">Testing was difficult due to the marriage of test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack of permission by the federal government by the end of February to use non-state test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could be done only by prescribing a treating doctor).</seg>
<seg id="258">The Washington Post reported that by February 27, less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="259">The Atlantic reported that by March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, were waiting for their turn for tests for hours or days." After the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was also soon declared by other states.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3, Seattle schools canceled classes, and by mid-March, schools closed nationwide. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London, informed the United States about predictions of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.</seg>

<seg id="263">Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences and urged employees to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">Sporting events and seasons were canceled. On March 11, Trump announced restrictions on travel to most of Europe, with the exception of the UK, for 30 days, starting on March 13.</seg>
<seg id="265">The next day, he expanded the restrictions to also include Great Britain and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to combat the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Starting March 15, many companies began to close or reduce opening hours throughout the United States, assisting in the fight against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">By March 17, the epidemic was confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that 10,700 cases of infection were reported in New York per day, which exceeds the total number of cases in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As of March 28, 32,308 cases were reported in New York, and 672 people died. It was reported that on March 26, more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, with 12,841 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on March 30, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distancing until April 30.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the USNS Comfort hospital ship with 1000 beds moored at the port of New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, 884 coronavirus deaths within 24 hours were reported in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="274">In New York State, as of April 3, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 people. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring public access information by controlling, through Vice President Mike Pence's office, public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="275">In general, the opinions of supporters of President Trump about how successfully he manages to cope with the crisis are divided.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some officials and observers criticized the US dependence on imports of essential materials, including basic necessities, from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">In mid-January 2020, the journal Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns that was used to map and predict disease spread patterns.</seg>
<seg id="278">Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.</seg>
<seg id="280">Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was named the least prepared for an outbreak of the disease, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its New Coronavirus Emergency Plan (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="281">In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about the COVID-19 and that Australia will focus on border control and communications in the threat situation.</seg>
<seg id="282">A human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia on 21 March.</seg>
<seg id="283">Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, for which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.</seg>
<seg id="284">Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan said it was not going to evacuate citizens from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and a citizen of India.</seg>
<seg id="287">Citizens of Poland, China and India landed in Poland, where a Brazilian plane made a stop before flying to Brazil according to the route.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens visiting Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near the city of Brasilia.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadian citizens (176 people from the first and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the US government) were evacuated from Wuhan, delivered to the base of the Canadian Armed Forces Trenton and quarantined for a period of two weeks.</seg>

<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government flew with 112 South African citizens on board.</seg>
<seg id="296">Prior to departure, a medical examination of passengers was performed, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans with negative analyses for coronavirus were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="298">Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and as a precaution, they all remained under surveillance and were quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.</seg>
<seg id="299">On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq in connection with the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 5, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent their assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">Some Chinese students studying at American universities have teamed up to collect and send help to regions of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respiratory agents to clinics in Hubei province on January 30. Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization, together with FedEx, sent 200,000 medical masks, as well as other personal protective equipment, including gloves and robes, by an ambulance to Wuhan Union Clinic by January 30.</seg>
<seg id="302">On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment of coronavirus, as well as to protect populations of "at-risk groups in Africa and South Asia" from the threat of the virus.</seg>

After the situation in China stabilized, the country also sent assistance to other countries affected by the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="307">Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute them to its participating states.</seg>
<seg id="308">He later also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL machines to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">Ma also donated medicine to Canada. The Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Georgia expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and test kits.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, providing only 30% accuracy, and the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium also recalled 100,000 unsuitable medical masks: it was assumed that they were manufactured in China, but subsequently it turned out that they came from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and curb the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="314">WHO noted clear differences between the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government "regularly provided updated information about the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."</seg>
<seg id="315">On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on movement by transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that, although "this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO," it is also "a very important confirmation of the fulfilment of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the place of greatest spread," and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health." On January 30, after the ability to transmit infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHEIC); this situation was the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.</seg>
<seg id="317">Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movement and trade," and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."</seg>
<seg id="318">On February 5, WHO asked the world community for $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that "do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries."</seg>
<seg id="319">Mr. Tedros also said that "the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link," and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay in the future." At a press conference held on February 11, WHO established the official name of the disease - COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General António Guterres agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem."</seg>
<seg id="321">As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will "focus on the health response, while other agencies may use their expertise to combat the outbreak of the disease more socially and economically."</seg>
<seg id="322">On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation within the country and to assess the "severity of the disease and its contagion," Organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess "the effectiveness of responses at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural areas." On February 25, WHO said that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that" it is too early to call this disease a pandemic, but countries should nevertheless be ready for it. "</seg>
<seg id="323">When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials announced that the likelihood of a global spread of coronavirus would be increased from "high" to "very high" - the highest degree of preparedness and risk.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet for readiness for reality: it's time to act.</seg>
<seg id="325">This virus may be already on the way to your country, and you need to be prepared, "and also emphasized that the right response can help the world avoid the" worst case scenario. "</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan also said that current data do not justify the declaration of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting this virus."</seg>
<seg id="327">On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue." WHO has been heavily criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="329">In response to this situation, a petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.</seg>
<seg id="330">On March 26, 2020 dozens of experts of the UN in human rights emphasized importance of observance of the rights of each person during COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The expert group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving measures against him, and the government is responsible for organizing such measures.</seg>
<seg id="332">The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.</seg>
<seg id="333">The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations consider the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="336">The digital site provides information on Country Policy Tracker policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="337">The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their actions to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="338">A number of provincial leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and the dismissal indicated dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe that this move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger about the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with an earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but took the side of a conspiracy theory according to which COVID-19 arose in the United States or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">The administration of US President Donald Trump called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only aggravates the situation with the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic," and this statement was in turn criticized by some commentators who claim that this approach is racist and "distracts from the inability of the US presidential administration to contain the spread of the disease."</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast gained access to a US government telegram that contains a communications strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council; at the same time, there are such references to the strategy: "It's all in China.</seg>
<seg id="343">We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television speeches. " Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a "propaganda push" to gain global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">EU Foreign Minister Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity."</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrell also said that "China is persistently promoting the idea of ​ ​ its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."</seg>
<seg id="346">China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some reports, sending aid to the last two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba came under ban in connection with US sanctions imposed on April 3.</seg>
<seg id="348">The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid destined for other countries to their own country.</seg>
<seg id="349">With regard to medical masks, there were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey appropriated hundreds of IVL devices intended for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for coronavirus-covered Italy.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China has reacted bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">This clearly does not indicate European solidarity. "</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the sending of Russian military orderlies, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source," claiming that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world community at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.</seg>
<seg id="357">Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="360">NATO military exercises "Defender 2020," planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries - the largest NATO military exercises after the end of the Cold War - will be held in a shortened format.</seg>
<seg id="361">The secretary general Kampanii Kate Hudson criticized for nuclear disarmament the doctrine Defender 2020 (Defender-2020) ":" In a crisis situation which developed in the sphere of public health care today holding these exercises threatens life not only US military men and many European member countries, but also residents of the countries where such events have to be held". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus. About two dozen members of parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians, were infected.</seg>
<seg id="362">On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic has given rise to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified system of health and child care, paid family leave and increased public health funding.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political scientists expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened.</seg>
<seg id="364">South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen who arrived from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in places specially designated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society was initially divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the Government's inadequate response to the outbreak. The pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators express concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, the parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to govern through decrees, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those who will be accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The outbreak of coronavirus was cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.</seg>
<seg id="370">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment, which arose from increased consumer demand and malfunctioning suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="371">Panic purchases also occurred in several localities; this led to a situation where essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to WHO Director General Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has grown 100 times.</seg>
<seg id="374">This spike led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products by four to six months.</seg>
<seg id="375">It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that for this reason health workers would be under attack.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, due to the pandemic, Daigou buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, severe food shortages were avoided in both areas.</seg>
<seg id="378">The successful measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant recessions, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices may rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">Food store shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials ensured access to pork supplies to ensure full nutrition for the population.</seg>
<seg id="381">Similar laws require food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy affected China: according to media reports dated March 16, the Chinese economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the government, as a result of which retail sales fell by 20.5%.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, the viral outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="384">According to Agate Demaray, an Economist Intelligence Unit employee, market volatility will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could surpass the impact of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="386">According to one estimate made by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take "urgent measures" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various US stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, the S &amp; P 500 index and the Dow Jones index for industrial stocks, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1191 point - the largest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.</seg>
<seg id="390">At the end of the week, all three indices showed a more than 10 percent drop.</seg>
<seg id="391">On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Shares fell again due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.</seg>
<seg id="395">Central banks respond faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to take any trips.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decrease in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.</seg>
<seg id="398">The negative impact on the cruise line industry was as strong as ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="401">A number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional Governments; private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many New Year's events were canceled, and tourist attractions were closed in order to prevent mass crowds of people; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City was closed and traditional temple fairs were canceled.</seg>
<seg id="403">In 24 out of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until February 10, instructing most enterprises not to open before this date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the celebration of the New Year. The retail sector suffered on a global scale: store hours were reduced, and some stores were temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50-60%.</seg>
<seg id="408">As a result, in March, attendance at shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.</seg>
<seg id="409">Operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitary conditions, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14-22 million more people beyond poverty than would be the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.</seg>
<seg id="411">Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, an outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The self-isolation measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households faced unemployment in one way or another. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany have transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced working schedule - part-time.</seg>
<seg id="414">The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="415">The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="416">Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting people of art.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed around the world indefinitely, or access to them was variously limited, and exhibitions, events and performances were canceled or postponed to other dates.</seg>
<seg id="418">Instead, extensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry also experienced failures. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week events in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Great Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders offer outdoor services.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed to visit its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, churches and gurdwars.</seg>
<seg id="422">The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned the access of foreign pilgrims and their own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events were canceled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, Premier League 2019-20, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-20 and NHL season 2019-20.</seg>
<seg id="425">The coronavirus outbreak also ruined plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July; On March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed to the period after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or canceled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This has led many players to go online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry also suffered as various music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also canceled all their performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions continue to perform, produce or publish their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">Many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have appeared on the network, many of which are humorous and smooth out the alarming moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the emergence of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against representatives of the population of hot spots in Europe, the USA and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="431">Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.</seg>
<seg id="432">Information reports for February (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for something.</seg>
<seg id="433">Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.</seg>
<seg id="435">Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, were supported both offline and online.</seg>
<seg id="436">The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition, insisting on banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the hashtag # Chinese DontComeToJapan (# Chinese NeVisitors "ViaPoniya) held a leading position on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this opinion racist and anti-Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="440">In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Novye Sanzhary.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students coming from China-bordering northeastern India and studying in major cities in India reported cases of persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="442">Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party State Unit, West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "therefore God avenged them."</seg>
<seg id="443">Later, these statements received condemnation from the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them a "delusion." In China, due to the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents erupted again: foreigners were called "foreign garbage" and objects to be "disposed of."</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="445">Many scientific publishers have publicly published their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="446">Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drug repositioning (also known as repurposing, redirecting, task changing, or therapeutic drug redirection) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally contemplated in development.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral preparation against COVID-19 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP-ribophosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarities in structure with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti- SARS-CoV-2 drug to be recommended for clinical research.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine will be among the four drugs being investigated as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Permit of Use (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="10">The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only permitted under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDC stated that "the order of use, dosage, or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="12">Doctors say they use the drug when there is "no other option."</seg>
<seg id="13">A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.</seg>
<seg id="14">Large-scale research is conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="15">New York University Langon School of Medicine is studying the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "unambiguously effective."</seg>
<seg id="17">In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took this drug, a negative result was obtained after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Wuhan, a study was conducted that followed 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received favipiravir and the second half received umifenovir.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results indicating the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered final.</seg>
<seg id="20">On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its reserves, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to one study on the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs was not revealed."</seg>
<seg id="24">Drugs have been developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.</seg>
<seg id="25">A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs that were specially developed for the therapy of HIV and AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="26">WHO included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.</seg>
<seg id="27">Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences staff found that remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one is performed on patients with a moderate form of the disease and the other on patients with a more severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are currently three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without using a placebo (Italy).</seg>

<seg id="1">Control of production factors due to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the use of methods for ensuring labor safety and health protection in order to control the risk and control of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Proper workplace risk control depends on the place and task, is based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with a lower risk level have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home for signs of illness, respiration etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international trips.</seg>
<seg id="6">Such a category may include employees in contact with the public, for example, in schools, a working environment with a high population density and in some large retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protection against contact with a person infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA believes that health care and mortuary staff in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are in a high-risk category; the level of risk is increased to a very high level when such employees perform procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of safety engineering tools, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task concerned.</seg>
<seg id="10">An outbreak of COVID-19 can have different kinds of effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commercial patterns can vary both with regard to the types of goods that are in demand and the methods of purchasing such goods (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, there may be interruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used for protection.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus to staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.</seg>
<seg id="18">The response is influenced by the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hierarchy of risk controls is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health, for grouping such tools according to effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, engineering and technical security tools are most effective, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection tools.</seg>
<seg id="21">Security engineering means isolating employees from work-related risk sites and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative measures involve changes to work policies or procedures that require action from a worker or employee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal Protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, fit in size (for example, respiratory devices), used constantly and properly, regularly checked, maintained in proper condition and replaced as necessary, as well as properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their peers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, Respecting respiratory etiquette, including hand closing of the mouth when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and containers for garbage, readiness for remote or removable operation, if necessary, recommendations for employees to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="27">Quickly identifying and isolating individuals who could potentially be infected is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="28">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until the heat stops, the absence of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other medicines, eliminates symptoms, and prescribes flexibility of policies on sick leave, Allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and ensure that employees are aware of such policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contacts no more than six feet away (1.8 m) with people for whom there are no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in society in the territory where the business is located, or due to recent trips of such a person to places of COVID-19 spread.</seg>
<seg id="30">These categories include employees who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, a high-density working environment and some large retail stores. Safety engineering tools for such groups and higher risk groups include the installation of high-performance air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such a group and higher risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings with communication using virtual means, setting shift schedules, termination of non-critical visits to COVID-19 distribution sites, development of communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for answering questions of concern to workers, providing relevant training for employees on COVID-19 risks and protection measures, Training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment in the correct use of such means, providing resources and a working environment that promotes personal hygiene, a requirement for regular washing of hands, restricting access to the workplace by clients and the public, placement of information indicators on the need to wash hands and other measures of protection against COVID-19. Depending on the work tasks, employees with a risk level of at least average may need to wear personal protective equipment, including in combinations including gloves, a robe, a screen or a face mask or safety glasses.</seg>
<seg id="31">In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respiratory agents.</seg>
<seg id="32">If a person is ill on a plane, then to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers, such measures as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for a sick person, providing a sick person with a mask or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Minor crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical center on the ship in the presence of heat or other symptoms in someone on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be introduced, for example, canceling trips for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and care times, limiting insignificant visits, using a separate health facility location for children with flu symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">At a high rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for prolonged non-attendance of schools can be considered. For law enforcement officials performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">Law enforcement officials obliged to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions prescribed by ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">When close contact occurs during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or rubbing, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothes.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that some categories of health care and mortuary workers are at high or very high risk.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="42">They have a very high risk of infection when they perform aerosol procedures or when collecting/processing samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include probing, cough-causing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or collection of samples by invasive methods.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk mortuary workers include those who treat the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees perform an autopsy, then they go into the category with a very high risk. Additional safety engineering tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19, including in aerosol procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions prescribed for biological safety level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends allocating incoming patients to delimited waiting areas based on suspected COVID-19 contamination. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends that workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, be used to use respiratory devices.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the United States, NIOSH-approved people with a N95 or higher filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respiratory devices can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of workwear because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratory rather than physiological fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">WHO recommends using only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the point of admission of patients.</seg>
<seg id="51">WHO recommends that persons collecting airway samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors of this disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation wear a surgical mask, safety glasses or facial shield, robe and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">When performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, instead of a surgical mask, a N95 or FFP2 must be worn.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such remedies through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers such as so transparent windows, providing access to the patient, infected COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal remedies, which are necessary for a particular task, prolonged use of the same respiratory agent, without withdrawing, when working with several patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection and advising against using masks for those without symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) that is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most cases are reduced to mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million infections were reported in 210 countries and regions, more than 153,000 people died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people recovered. The virus mainly spreads when people come into close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by getting to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms appear and in later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal smear.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected illness, as well as those who care for them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population differ: some departments recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">The local spread of the disease was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infected individuals may have no symptoms or flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or sensation of compression in the chest, confusion, difficulty awakening, sore face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, immediate medical attention should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="18">Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in different percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some cases recorded in China were initially manifested only by a feeling of compression in the chest and a palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death eventually occurs.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of such asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease course is currently unknown, it is only being studied; at the same time, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="27">China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report from April 1; of 166 infections reported on that day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can have a large concentration of virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than with speech of normal volume.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study conducted in Singapore showed that with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside of people's rooms showed the presence of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.</seg>
<seg id="34">Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">These values, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and detergents, when properly used, have a rather useful effect in combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to eliminate it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against this virus. During the study, which was conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="39">In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest virus content in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first found in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases recorded in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="42">Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar lung cells of type II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus connects to the ACE2 and enters the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - the "spike" (peplomer).</seg>
<seg id="45">12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in a severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, as they participate in the work of this organ.</seg>
<seg id="48">A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in ICU with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse prognoses. Autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing airway epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells have been found to correlate with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes releasing IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected during autopsy.</seg>
<seg id="52">WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) is a standard testing method.</seg>
<seg id="54">The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal smear, but a nasal or sputum smear sample may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results are usually ready over a period of several hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not of direct importance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of this virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet been widely distributed.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chinese experience in studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test for on-site diagnosis, giving permission for its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhunnan Hospital of Wuhan University indicate methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral multi-pleural "matte glass" compaction foci with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobbled bridge (lobular thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">Little data is available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main results of the pathological examination performed at autopsy:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-core giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (ICE syndrome); leykoeritroblastichesky reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of ​ ​ the hand.</seg>
<seg id="74">After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a high-quality hygienic procedure for the hands.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular, to limit transmission of infection by individuals with asymptomatic disease course. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and enterprises were closed, the movement of citizens was limited and large public events were canceled.</seg>
<seg id="76">Recommendations for distancing also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no drugs with confirmed efficacy against COVID-19. Since the completion of the development of the vaccine is not expected until 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are reduced to a decrease in the peak of the epidemic, known as "plateau access."</seg>
<seg id="78">The CDC also recommends washing hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after wrinkling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">The CDC also recommends using a disinfectant alcohol-containing (alcohol content - at least 60%) hand treatment agent, but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two formulations for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol having antimicrobial activity.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a humectant.</seg>
<seg id="83">Patients are shown maintenance therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">To strengthen immunity, compliance with personal hygiene rules, a healthy lifestyle and a diet are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the USA, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="91">When performing procedures during which air-droplet discharge may occur, such as intubation or drying of hands, precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="92">Healthcare providers caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing in an air drop insulator (AIIR) - an additional measure beyond standard contact and air precautions. The CDC published recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended personal protective equipment: protective gown, respiratory or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use respiratory agents rather than medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="94">Respiratory agents N95 approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respiratory agents under an Emergency Permit of Use (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not by instruction, effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="96">If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face screens or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.</seg>
<seg id="97">In most cases, the flow patterns of the COVID-19 are not severe enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory insufficiency is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with an intense airflow nasal oxygen cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as IVL.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some physicians opt for invasive mechanical ventilation if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for older adults (those over 60, and especially those over 80) is much higher.</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the soaring incidence of severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="104">The challenge of providing mechanical ventilation is becoming more complex, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in COVID-19, and oxygenation have become increasingly problematic.</seg>
<seg id="105">Inhalation pressure-supported VFVs and VFVs are required to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to provide minimal ventilation damage to them, which can result in pneumothorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">On earlier fan models, high PDCV may not be available.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antivirals are currently under clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="108">The most promising is remdesivir.</seg>
<seg id="109">The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Antiviral drugs can be tested in patients with severe forms of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="111">WHO-recommended volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary permission to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.</seg>
<seg id="112">Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies that should be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users must enter their name and identification number to sign in.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect "close contact" with surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence - such tools are used to track infected people and individuals with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government gave permission to security agencies to track the data of mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected with coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="119">Measures had been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who might come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided federal government agencies in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Russia, face recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italian Regional Commissioner for Health Giulio Galler said that cellular network operators report that "40% of people still continue to move around the territory."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease can occur mildly with minor or absent symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Patients with mild form of the disease recover generally within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.</seg>
<seg id="129">Pregnant women may be at higher risk of receiving a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.</seg>
<seg id="130">In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can progress rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.</seg>
<seg id="132">Abnormalities of thrombosis, especially increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while impaired kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between symptom onset and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the median time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to early stage case studies, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women - 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples suggest diffuse alveolar injury with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.</seg>
<seg id="140">The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of mortality by condition vary due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">An insufficiently effective calculation of cases in a light form can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms developed in general 1.4 times more often, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that in some patients who recovered from this disease, lung volume decreased by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">Once recovered, it can also lead to Post-Intensive Care Syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovering from the virus develop persistent immunity against it.</seg>
<seg id="150">Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where, after recovering from COVID-19, coronavirus tests still turned out to be positive.</seg>
<seg id="151">It is believed that in these cases there was an aggravated protracted course of the disease, and not re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from humans to humans.</seg>
<seg id="154">A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="155">According to official data published by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">All figures vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease, they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and population parameters such as age, sex and general health.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the disease emergency codes for МКБ-10: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV- 2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">This figure varies by region. Some other methods include the definition of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the mortality rate from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not time-specific and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone infection, by the presence of such antibodies it is possible to understand how many people were infected.</seg>
<seg id="163">At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, Germany's health care system was not overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="166">In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by blood donation rates.</seg>
<seg id="167">COVID-19 - the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.</seg>
<seg id="170">The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women has been narrowing only since the age of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, comorbidities in men (eg, hypertension manifested in men at younger ages than in women) may be responsible for higher mortality among men.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the US government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="176">Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, more likely to become infected.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease - COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreisus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease," and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">Such a name was chosen to avoid references to a particular geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In public communications, WHO additionally uses the tents "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19."</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus itself are usually called "coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the tents "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, official names were published - "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2."</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to limitations in the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as swabs for taking swabs from the nose, as well as parts of IVL devices.</seg>
<seg id="187">In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, then one of the local industries was repurposed and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the outbreak of COVID-19 first broke out, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread on the Internet at a high speed.</seg>
<seg id="189">Probably, people can infect other animals with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">At the moment, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.</seg>
<seg id="192">Various international studies of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the curative effect of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrates human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three vaccination strategies.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, the researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to induce a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies aim to destroy the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method for creating a vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, Seattle began the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody gain has been identified as one of the potential challenges in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.</seg>
<seg id="205">Drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Antiviral drug repurposing accounts for most of the Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta, are also considered.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir are available.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir as an exception.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used to treat malaria was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a means against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that permeation of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires priming of the spike protein with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2).</seg>
<seg id="217">Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without more detailed study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in treating COVID-19 is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="220">This drug reached stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is being conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results of its use were obtained in patients with a severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="221">In combination with a serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract such factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="224">The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tested in the treatment of patients for SARS, but its results were inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="226">Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.</seg>
<seg id="229">The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be increased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time in all stores in the country to two and one package, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, ALDI also imposed a limit on one package.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions were reported in advertisements at the box office, as well as on the network page on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to reports, citizens began to make emergency supplies due to fears that the COVID-19 could entail the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Coles retail chain said in a March 8 press release that with the introduction of a four-pack limit, "many stores are still buying up toilet paper too quickly - one delivery within an hour," and called such demand "unprecedented," while ALDI in a Facebook post posted on Tuesday called such a trend "unexpected."</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a Woolworths spokesman, last week saw a sharp increase in sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costco's Canberra store last week also limited that number to two packages.</seg>
<seg id="11">To fill the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made inventory for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to replenish stocks, but this is hampered by local authorities' restrictions on truck schedules.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects an increase in product costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, but at the same time less and less profitable offers are available.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to depletion of inventory, some stores cannot conduct promotions on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the report, News.com.au Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish stocks every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that toilet paper is a bulky product, so the number of warehouse stocks is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, the long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably would not panic like that," says Russell Zimmerman.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, announced the end of inventory.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent-branded goods, said they are working around the clock to provide enough goods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Domain.com, a real estate website, said that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the lack of buyers during the week of the Labor Day holiday, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to first bidders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, stores were at first reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, hand washers and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.</seg>

<seg id="3">TOPIC: [Covid-19] Relief and preparation for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">DISPATCH DATE/TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">PERMISSIONS: CC0: No protected rights</seg>
<seg id="6">This month we live in unusual circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">We observed friendly and caring relations between all our colleagues, which was reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chat rooms - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.</seg>
<seg id="10">I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.</seg>
<seg id="13">And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the health of sites, pay our colleagues or protect the security of communities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="15">At such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, starting from the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjust our work order and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robin previously said, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to retreat, then let it be.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all personnel, contractors and non-staff personnel:</seg>
<seg id="23">we expect it will take about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week before subsequent orders are issued.</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not announce days off: if you can work normally for more hours, it is allowed for the purposes of our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether it be to take care of relatives, buy food products or go to a doctor's appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.</seg>
<seg id="26">We're not following your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you're sick, you shouldn't work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no need to issue a sick leave or time off: simply inform your manager and help the team revise the calendar and work schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, let Brian from the T &amp; C Ops unit know so that T &amp; C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).</seg>
<seg id="31">Payment of hourly rates will be made in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each person will receive payment according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you cannot work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we'll support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do can bring amazing results, especially in such times.</seg>
<seg id="38">And again we are talking about self-help.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some types of work are considered significant.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must always support such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will initiate a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">A slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to work "twice as much to catch up" after the pandemic ends.</seg>
<seg id="47">You do not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.</seg>
<seg id="48">We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens to APP (annual plans)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations for the volume of daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021 years.</seg>
<seg id="51">We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budget formation, which will allow employees to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, and at the same time, everyone who needs or wants to work will be provided with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Next week we will present our proposal to the Council, provide representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank you to the APP team for leading this work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, risks and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="59">The building applies its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located on WeWork's network, which has shared its COVID-19-related rules with us and all DC personnel.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last week, our D.C. office completely transitioned to remote work as directed to San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some tips:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a multi-day course.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and distribute the materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">By default, use video communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.</seg>
<seg id="71">For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for maintaining notes (or joint inspection).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a convenient headset, contact technical support by email.</seg>
<seg id="73">Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement benefits when purchasing snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Connect to the # remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR Operations team examines ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons," until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of coordinated grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such goals.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.</seg>
<seg id="79">The general mood in the global community is not only an upset at the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief at mutual understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.</seg>
<seg id="80">In terms of perspectives, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.</seg>
<seg id="81">We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 2 p.m. UTC/07:00 PT.</seg>
<seg id="83">This time we will take the opportunity to further share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together connecting to each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are together in such a situation and are ready to help everything we can.</seg>
<seg id="85">You can still receive information from this e-mail and other important COVID-19 information from Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about travel, events, key work flow, information coverage problems, or other assistance, please contact CRT.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have any privacy issues, please email Bryan Judan, HR International Global Operations Director.</seg>
<seg id="91">No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and ensure the opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the whole world through the necessary service.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.</seg>
<seg id="95">Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work coming in future weeks and possibly months.</seg>
<seg id="96">For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as work with maximum return, as soon as such a need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Jer, Yime, Grant, Yant, Yn, Tan,</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "cases of suspicion of disease" and "confirmed cases COVID-19"</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our group published a quick reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides verified recommendations to combat this pandemic around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge increased gradually based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice were also continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "disease suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the "Diagnostic and Therapy Guidelines for COVID-19" document (seventh version) issued by the PRC National Health Committee.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially called coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">This publication attracted great attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge increased gradually based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice were also continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document "Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19" published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, with the content of some of its provisions changing significantly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, comments on our recommendations were provided in a paper prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with co-authors. They contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this pandemic that has swept the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to the latest issue of the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (Trial Seventh Version), both the results of ongoing studies and their work needs to be updated.</seg>
<seg id="15">In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspicion of disease, it is necessary to combine any one element from the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or localities in and around Wuhan or in other localities where cases of COVID-19 disease were recorded within 14 days before symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) the history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 disease were recorded during the last 14 days before symptoms were manifested; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases characterized by high fever or respiratory symptoms, recorded within 2 weeks in small plots, such as a house or apartment, office, classroom at school, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external manifestations of infection with COVID-19; (3) the total white blood cell count is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocyte counts early in symptom presentation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Diagnosis for a confirmed disease case should be based on the case of suspected disease with one of the following items of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full genome viral sequencing shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or changing the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody IgG, or increasing the titer by at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the airways or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pathogenetic diagnosis of a blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then the seventh issue added the need for serological proof.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the results of continuous work by researchers looking for an optimal kit for detecting nucleic acids at rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, there is growing evidence of the need for caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, the roadmap presented in Zhou et al should be updated because it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The evaluation system also requires clarification in the conduct of further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">In conclusion, we hope to receive more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">With regard to the diagnosis of "cases of suspicion of illness" and "confirmed cases," we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 fatalities per day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported infections included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Mirjabi, the two who died were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">On March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="10">An employee of the clinic told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti clinic Meitri.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, in an online video, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport will be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Public transport was stopped from March 26 and was supposed to resume on Saturday, April 4.</seg>
<seg id="13">The transportation of essential goods - medicines, fuel, and food - was still permitted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Health Organization declares pandemic COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the tent "pandemic" refers only to the magnitude of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is possible if countries are involved in identifying, testing, treating, isolating patients, tracking cases of the disease, as well as mobilizing their citizens, "explained WHO Director General Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreisus.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been tracked since its occurrence to continuous global spread."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before. "</seg>
<seg id="11">First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then assigned it a new status - a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it will be worse next."</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 disease were recorded in the world, more than 4,600 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated virus SARS-CoV-2 involves methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific and is intended only for detecting RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control purposes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to go to hospital, or completely absent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was very contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries can be significantly exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The real-time polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test can be performed on airway samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or sputum sample.</seg>
<seg id="12">Results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR test performed on throat swabs is valid only during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, nevertheless continuing to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, material from the lower respiratory tract can alternatively be taken with a suction catheter, or expectorization products (sputum) can be used.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It identifies an "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses and an RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive permission from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time diagnostic panel for PT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource organization.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that date that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency permit of use. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide from March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions were reported; The sampling and processing of analyses shall be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VECTOR."</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020 Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to conduct tests of the Abbott m2000 system; The FDA previously issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative results in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A monoclonal antibody test is currently being developed in Taiwan that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to the rapid influenza test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that "chest radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear."</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features detected during CT include two-sided multi-pleural "matte glass" compaction foci with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subpleural dominance, cobblestone bridge symptom, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnosis." As of March 2020, it is the PCR method that the CDC recommends for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">A partially immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after day 7 of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to conduct population control. Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)</seg>
<seg id="39">In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.</seg>
<seg id="40">CLT typically uses a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="41">In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling step is not required to take a test tube. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="44">Test performance is several hundred samples over several hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of its antibody assay kits produced satisfactory results.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed that allows patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "emergency department employees hand over a sample tube to the patient," the patient spits in it, gives it back and after a while receives test results. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient contracting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport a patient. During rapid COVID-19 testing in case of suspicious cases, the medical officer takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Express testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures than in any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors announced that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they could do only 10,700 tests a week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If an examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to Institute President Robert Koch, Germany's total testing productivity is 160,000 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several large cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, since only positive results are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="52">The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 analyses were taken for SARS-CoV-2, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had a positive result. Researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital clinics developed and tested a method to simultaneously test samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of ​ ​ 2,000 square meters. meters for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese 火眼 or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if the laboratory had not been commissioned at such an accelerated rate, there would have been 47% more cases in Hubei and, accordingly, quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.</seg>
<seg id="54">During the discovery of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately discovered in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai - in a total of 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, daily total throughput rates were 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits have been released that can test up to 1,122 patient assays per COVID19 using only 93 tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, due to the lack and insufficient amount of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, Great Britain and the USA.</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that involve heating samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita is currently higher than that of any other country, and most of the population will soon be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a laboratory for mass testing of the population from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their laboratories for the detection of emergency cases of Huo-Yan in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world of such a large scale operating outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Different testing options targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German version was published on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was unavailable until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of test kits in China and the United States, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">But in South Korea, according to experts, the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of a new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">For several years, the South Korean government worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the pandemic. COVID-19 As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and stocks of materials for taking smears and chemicals were quickly depleted.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China announced problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">American test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws," and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private test development. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The firm explained that the cause of the inaccuracy of the results could be unsuccessful sampling or incorrect use of kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that give inaccurate results and replace them with other kits - those of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovich proposed dumping them on the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unsuitable for use.</seg>
<seg id="71">Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as follow-up for people with whom such patients came into contact, had positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of those with positive outcomes had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">The entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="75">With intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and it did not have to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began to strongly advise residents to stay at home, but schools whose holidays ended on March 23 opened on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries managed to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results per COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for validation testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the next graph, the% Positive Results column depends on the country-specific testing policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage positive result compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapidly growing rate of cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the UK, thereby confirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the pandemic is COVID-19 growing rapidly in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of readiness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection was a new type of coronavirus, now known as type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">From that moment, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, in the form of an airway infection with or without pneumonia, with most patients recovering.</seg>
<seg id="8">In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a disease of a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% takes a critical form when intensive care is required.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">This study analyses trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union (EU )/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">After flash in China COVID-19 extended to other countries, and now in the rest of the world the pandemic of COVID-19 develops according to the same dynamics, as in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on January 24, 2020 - all three cases returned from Wuhan, China's Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, while between December 31, 2019 and this date, 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths were recorded, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, occur in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country in the world, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indicator of level of distribution of active cases of COVID-19 the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days taking into account the ordinary course of COVID-19 in each country of the EU/the EEA and in Great Britain from January 1 till March 15, 2020 was calculated.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provided a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 AM on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 trends</seg>
<seg id="24">Trends in truncated cumulative COVID-19 incidence over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the UK were broadly consistent with those observed in Hubei Province of China (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends towards an increase in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to the same for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to these data, the total number of cases already reported as of 8:00 pm on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results suggest a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">Observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases of the disease and different rules for selecting patients for analysis for the presence of COVID-19, including "catch-up" testing.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.</seg>
<seg id="33">To date, data on COVID-19 admissions to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not reported).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current surveillance data, the subject of which is the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per population 100,000 in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The ECDC Sixth Update Report on Rapid Risk Assessment Results for COVID-19 presents scenarios of health system resource load modelling with estimates for hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK when the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases are currently grouped by specific EU/EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided, if possible, by units of level 2 Nomenclature of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the pandemic is COVID-19 developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the scenario of contact infection with long-term SARS-CoV-2, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which, for example, can be observed in affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, Of great importance for deterring the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an operational, proactive and integrated approach, followed by a shift from deterrence to minimization of consequences, because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals, perhaps there will simply not be enough time to reflect, adopt and adjust their response accordingly, unless such action is taken in advance.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health interventions designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">If this is not done, then in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutation and adaptation stimulated coevolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild disease, such as a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China at the end of 2019 year again attracted attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with high transmissibility, but more weakly expressed pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="6">Human coronavirus infection is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intermediate carrier reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interaction of animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and ways of interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar RNA thread.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses with the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, were named due to their form, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a crown.</seg>
<seg id="17">In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins of replicase pp1a and pp1ab.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins designated nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">In other coronavirus lines, a number of liniespecific accessor proteins are also encoded.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on differences in protein sequences ,\coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma - and deltakoronaviruses), while the species of betakoronaviruses includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betakoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltakoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecific barriers, and some of them have evolved to pathogens dangerous to humans.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="27">The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type two SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infectious diseases in a comparatively large number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and presenting extrapulmonary symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first strand of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients separated from the nasopharynx who had a cold in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, thanks to extensive research, more detailed knowledge has been accumulated about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with human coronavirus was considered generally harmless.</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were ill, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, while the disease spread sporadically to other countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Discovered in 2019, a new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected exceeded 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The disturbing signal is received, and the world has to be prepared for the future pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources are bats, mice or pets.</seg>
<seg id="38">Numerous data sets suggest in favor of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms viruses have adapted well and in which they do not show pathogenic properties, but show wide genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world mentally, scientifically, socially and morally.</seg>
<seg id="40">A study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecific transfer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It may also prompt or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">This review provides general information on zoonotic origin, interspecific transmission, and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we designate and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecific transmission to the new carrier.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the same context, the result of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the strain B814 virus HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample of nasopharyngeal patients who had a cold, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, hooks and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="49">Table 1 informatively and clearly presents a brief history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first strain of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the airways of patients with infectious involvement of the upper respiratory tract in 1966; further this virus adapted to reproduction in lines of pulmonary cages WI-38.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage to the brains of sucker mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus appear similar to those of infection with the HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from damage to other pathogens of the respiratory tract, for example influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and are usually transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="55">Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the results of the study in volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.</seg>
<seg id="58">The SARS outbreak, also known as the "SARS epidemic," was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the cause of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first SARS case was identified in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and across continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">Excluding overactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load occurred on the 10th day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general malaise, and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="63">Common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, disorders in hepatic samples and increased levels of creatine kinase.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients with SARS also exhibit diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage levels.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In such severe cases, other organs, including gastrointestinal organs, liver and kidneys, may also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for immunocompromised patients.</seg>
<seg id="67">For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, huge efforts have been directed to the research of human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="69">At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="70">At first, it was found to mainly affect young children, the elderly and patients with immunocompromised and respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of diseases caused by it occurs in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called cereal.</seg>
<seg id="76">HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="78">Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases of the mild form, has been detected around the world.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation entailing highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents were and their causes unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and persist in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="81">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Most laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, imported cases were recorded and spread through episodic secondary cases of infection with close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, there are more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, which is now, looking back, associated with infection caused by coronavirus of severe type 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been called "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were recorded worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It should be noted that the death rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside it - 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly transition to acute respiratory failure syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Cases of asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 have been recorded, which indicates the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">Firstly, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the course of diseases caused by them.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, in terms of severity of symptoms, COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 и HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most often observed when infected with human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even absence of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio here is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there are also interesting patterns characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility decreases with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. infection of each following person), as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in feces samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway is as significant (in at least some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause community-acquired infections.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the future development of an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after the transition through humans.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four human coronaviruses causing community-acquired infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">On the other hand, perhaps it is humans who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.</seg>
<seg id="114">Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate sufficiently in the human body to accumulate adaptive mutations counteracting carrier restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the outbreak lasts SARS-CoV-2 and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its transmission among people will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.</seg>
<seg id="120">The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to preserve and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 have traits similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoVs, at least currently.</seg>
<seg id="124">But it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it adapts completely to humans and will circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, enhancing, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="127">The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier for HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the reservoir carrier continuously carries HCoV for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced into humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate lightning fast and then passing it on to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can tolerate dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="134">In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish prolonged endemicity.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals (game).</seg>
<seg id="137">Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traffickers have higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus compared to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar and almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, no more SARS cases were reported.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering the markets, in most cases, SARS-CoV was not determined, which allows us to conclude that Himalayan civets could serve only as an intermediate reinforcing carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is noteworthy that since 80% of various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate enhancing carriers cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="142">They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent search for a natural SARS-CoV carrier animal revealed a closely related bat CoV, which was called SARS-associated horseshoe bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the foundations of a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except one that is designated WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</seg>
<seg id="149">It has been shown that WIV1 derived from a bat fecal sample uses bat, civet and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Curiously, the sera of recovering SARS patients may have neutralized WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis refers MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.</seg>
<seg id="154">CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), for virus penetration.</seg>
<seg id="155">MERS-CoV virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to those from betacoronavirus bats identified in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats coincides only 87%.</seg>
<seg id="158">That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-humped camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal swabs of single-humped camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed minor symptoms, but massive viral release.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels isolated the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main way of isolating the virus in bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, questions still remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are plausible due to human transmission to humans or transmission by unknown channels including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The homology of nucleotides SARS-CoV-2 96.2% coincides with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from Asian horseshoes Rhinolophus affinis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.</seg>
<seg id="166">That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, which indicates a likely case of transfer from the animal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also tolerate a parent betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.</seg>
<seg id="169">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus is 85-92% identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the level of nucleotide sequences of about 90%.</seg>
<seg id="171">They cluster in two sub-lines of differentiation of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.</seg>
<seg id="172">Quite the contrary, the RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the determination of viral contigs in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">In this study, other assembly and manual processing methods were used to obtain a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="179">Whereas the highest homology of the sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta coronaviruses of pangolins, related SARS-CoV-2, at SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 the highest homology of the sequences within all genome.</seg>
<seg id="180">Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.</seg>
<seg id="181">The opposite proposal advocates recombination between pangolin betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of viruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of strains HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">Bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically associated with another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could be camel.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of history of HCoV interspecific transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="190">When interspecific transmission of the virus occurred around 1890 HCoV-OC43 and people contracted from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Bat alphacoronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between them is the alpacoronavirus alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="194">Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">Firstly, it was people, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thus, the possibility that alpacas received alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from people cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to people.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as the gene pool of the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-humped camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecific transmission from bats to single-humped camels and from single-humped camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is obvious that bats give a rich pool of varieties of viruses for interspecific exchange of gene fragments and interspecific transfer.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats "ideal distributors."</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-humped camels decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="208">He adapted well to these camels, which turned from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="209">In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead end MERS-CoV carrier, since its transmission is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in virus transmission is SARS-CoV-2 different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, betakoronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They can be dead end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">Future studies need to confirm or exclude several possibilities for interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">People can share an ecological niche with bats thanks to coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancement carriers into which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently entered.</seg>
<seg id="218">People become infected with the virus through cutting carcasses and eating wild animal meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.</seg>
<seg id="221">Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form, which contacted both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for animal origin is SARS-CoV-2 ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of carrier animals, the three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the intersection of interspecific barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and attenuation or even non-viability.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses due to the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs that needs to be tested during clinical research.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of mutations SARS-CoV-2 apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.</seg>
<seg id="235">Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific coevolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses if appropriate conditions are present.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 ′ -end of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, due to the unique mechanism of matrix selection, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">During transcription of the DNA of a coronavirus in a carrier that serves as a mixing vessel, strand switching often occurs.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and bat batCoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-carrier interaction with respect to transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the above three viral factors, another key factor important for interspecific transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.</seg>
<seg id="243">In this paper, recombination of SARS-CoV is cited as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecific transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on the RSD of the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RSD of the coronavirus protein S interacts with the cell receptor, and the response of the carrier antibody intensively selects it.</seg>
<seg id="246">RSD in SARS-CoV are amino acids, 318 to 510, on the fragment S1, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (АПФ2), as well as its co-receptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="247">SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize receptors АПФ2 different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, making interspecific transmission of the virus possible.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD that differ from human and civet viral strains, with 4 of them in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the АПФ2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">SARS-CoV of civeta has mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike-like protein with the human receptor АПФ2.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 segment results in that the binding affinity of S protein to human АПФ2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a cryo-electron microscope study says the affinity of this bond is 10-20 times higher than between human АПФ2 and SARS-CoV virus S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors were required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to АПФ2, but to another segment of the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans following interspecific transmission from carrier animals.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecific HCoV transmission is also driven by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.</seg>
<seg id="259">Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, single-humped camels, and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">For successful interspecific transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp dependence factors and subordinate carrier restriction factors to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and carrier still need to be defined and categorised.</seg>
<seg id="262">Unbiased, full-genome screening of carrier dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology can provide good results.</seg>
<seg id="263">Emergence of new HCoV: back to zero elevation</seg>
<seg id="264">The variety of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among SARS-CoV processor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but they were found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion was found characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="270">This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamkoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites were determined in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombination localizations have also been determined in nsp9 unstructured proteins, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their unstructured genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is most likely due to the release of the virus from the exerted selection pressures, for example, from the carrier's immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of such effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to bi-nucleotide deletion.</seg>
<seg id="277">While an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus exhibits a single nucleotide insert, resulting in a frame shift.</seg>
<seg id="278">Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the extraction pressure on their reservoir carriers.</seg>
<seg id="279">When infecting bats with coronaviruses, weakly expressed symptoms or their absence were recorded, which indicates a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.</seg>
<seg id="280">It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, proinflammatory response activation defects in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the aprogulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while simultaneously affecting the reading by exoribonuclease, thus creating selection pressure to generate virus strains that, when penetrated into the new carrier, turn out to be highly pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for carrier adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="285">Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared over the past twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is the secret to why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly associated with immune response hyperactivation and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response does not involve coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same non-binding immune response strategy may have beneficial effects in anti- SARS-CoV-2 therapy.</seg>
<seg id="292">In bats, the interferon response is especially strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Thus, taking type I interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a favorable effect.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome was disrupted in bats.</seg>
<seg id="295">On this basis, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred.</seg>
<seg id="297">While betacoronavirus of bats was found, whose nucleotide homology is 95% the same as SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology coincides 96% with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although it has been found that civets and other animals in markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate carriers have been established for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="299">Pangolin betacoronaviruses were found to be strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which suggests that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangolin betacoronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.</seg>
<seg id="301">Coronaviruses have attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoir animals in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">Strong evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transferred to humans via intermediate carriers.</seg>
<seg id="304">If SARS-CoV infection comes from human-civet contact in markets, closing game markets and destroying chickens on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin betacoronaviruses, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection from food markets, pangolin should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may continue to be the task of future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels combined with other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="313">A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the world.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">To reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between people and animals, one should abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the harsh tests that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have become, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are needed.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility arises of capturing new territories.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although many properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be minimized.</seg>
<seg id="321">To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future disease outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the puzzle of zoonotic origin, SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmitted the ancestral virus to SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then it is necessary to determine how people came into contact with bats.</seg>
<seg id="326">Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate carrier, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor viruses will be determined in their natural carriers.</seg>
<seg id="329">Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
