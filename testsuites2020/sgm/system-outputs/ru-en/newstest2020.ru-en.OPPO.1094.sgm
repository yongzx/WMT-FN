<seg id="1">COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed that are officially supported by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several variants of contact tracking applications have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government, together with Alipay, has rolled out an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">The app was developed by local IT companies, has open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-powered app called "StopKorona!," which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides prompt communication with health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an app with a geozoning feature, which aims to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by only a small fraction of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to include only "official" or other trusted organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications, including whether the surveillance infrastructure set up to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations have announced eight conditions they impose on government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by sunset clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;</seg>
<seg id="23">The security and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;</seg>
<seg id="26">Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google and Apple are offering their joint plan to address the issue of ongoing surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="29">In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, eliminating the need to download the application and the ability to avoid tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that have access to raw location data also have large potential privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a special app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="35">The government has not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected individuals, but has also made location information publicly available, made possible by significant changes to data protection legislation that have been made since the MERS outbreak in that country.</seg>
<seg id="36">Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been made public.</seg>
<seg id="38">Contacts tracking that preserves privacy is an established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all comparisons take place on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group, the MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform's work is based on research cited in "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic," published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by the MIT Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their widespread adoption.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Deployment of tools to enable governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with coronavirus, but with data confidentiality</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance by first implementing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as "hand hygiene," is the process of cleaning the hands to remove impurities, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral means.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person may also contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five critical moments during the day after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If water and soap are not available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after cooking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after the procedures of caring for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or washing the child going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After shriveling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, food or waste of animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing your hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This procedure is especially important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections -</seg>
<seg id="16">and reduces the infant mortality rate in home births.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as hand washing with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in diarrhoea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARI), provided appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing an estimated 1.8 million children per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia together kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after meals, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing also prevents the onset of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, consequently, to its damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that washing hands too often can lead to itching and peeling of the skin - a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Too much hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shriveling, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, hand washing with soap is relatively uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US is closer to the middle, at 77%; and the lowest rate was recorded in China, at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Philippine Department of Education's "Emergency Medical Care Program" is an example of large-scale interventions to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">This national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily teeth brushing with fluoride.</seg>
<seg id="36">The same program is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone is not considered effective for cleansing the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly soluble in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sufficient water, however, contributes to the purification process.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to reusable use, may also contain bacteria that may get on it with previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies on bacteria entering the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggest a low likelihood of such exposure, as the bacteria are washed away with foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still states that "liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap is heavily advertised in health-conscious communities.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are inherently resistant to antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their efficacy may not match that advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to the surfactant and skin protection agents, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands, simple varieties of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosan.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water at removing natural fats that hold back contaminants and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, hand disinfectants, or sanitizers) began to gain popularity.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing convenience of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm reduction 3.5 similar to reduction by 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% - 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm reduction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-containing agents should be used to thoroughly treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="60">The front and back surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingertips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash your hands rather than use disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="62">The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softeners and/or skin moisturizers.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances to the product.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, as pathogens are still on hand when used.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.</seg>
<seg id="76">If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="77">To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends a hand-washing technique that includes the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is the running water that is recommended, because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water just doesn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (rather than just one water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="82">Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Rinsing hands in standing water can trigger reinfection.</seg>
<seg id="86">Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is often recommended to use moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="90">If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottle pumpkin with holes made, and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">A foot pedal crane is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed to pour water on your hands, using a piece of soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Napkins and Towels was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, comparing the hygiene levels of paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern streaming air hand dryers.</seg>
<seg id="95">It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the pads of the fingers increases by 194% on average, and on the palms - by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an airflow dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the pads of the fingers increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads decreases to 76% on average, and on the palms of the hands - to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several toilet visitors and the toilet environment with each type of drying.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet-air dryer, which releases air at claimed speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms off its hands and out of its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet and bathroom users within a radius of up to 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">No significant spread of microorganisms was detected with the use of paper towels. In 2005, the company Tired V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.</seg>
<seg id="101">There are the following changes in the number of bacteria depending on the method of hand drying:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">Cleaning hands with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="104">An alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high efficacy (in 1846) in preventing diseases in inpatient settings.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget about it.</seg>
<seg id="107">According to one study, the use of such devices does help reduce infection rates.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="109">The hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, use a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="113">This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings: large numbers of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of bloodstream infections associated with catheter use by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting a standard hand washing and treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.</seg>
<seg id="117">The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="118">The review was co-authored by Whitby.</seg>
<seg id="119">If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure performance and check hand hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization designates "five moments" when you need to wash your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">after contact with blood or bodily fluids -</seg>
<seg id="122">before using antiseptic, as well as</seg>
<seg id="123">Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment high in antibiotic-resistant organisms. "Cleaning" hands before surgery requires a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile friction brush, and another sterile tool to clean under your nails.</seg>
<seg id="125">All decorations must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow usually for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need to rub your hands for too long, such as 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="128">During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After finishing the washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after care procedures for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="131">To combat staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing benefits the most, and that very few additional benefits were gained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of wiping hands with an alcohol-containing solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treating hands with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are still more effective than alcoholic hand solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium diffusion spores on the hands. Hand hygiene activities in health facilities may include training staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, and written and verbal reminders to staff to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed on the most effective interventions in different health facilities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective and important for improving health and even digestion.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate the habit of washing hands regularly.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand washing taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.</seg>
<seg id="140">To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results need to be monitored and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="141">One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach, which advocates for simple, cost-effective measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.</seg>
<seg id="142">By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">The installation of hand washers is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce morbidity and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emojis symbolizing hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="145">Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).</seg>
<seg id="146">However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a significantly more economical solution than other sanitary measures.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern nursing."</seg>
<seg id="148">At the time, most people still believed the infections were caused by putrid odors called miasmas.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections related to medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">In Germany, for example, posters with "proper hand washing techniques" were hung next to hand washers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "wash your hands" refers to a manifestation of your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; the phrase has since become more widely used in some English congregations.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she herself committed and encouraged her husband to commit.</seg>
<seg id="155">It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them hand washers are more important.</seg>
<seg id="156">It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in any other "cleansing" compensatory activities, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of a ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing after going to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity, with more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections so far in China and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2">Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which falls on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number one enemy to society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from a range of patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which broke out in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the currently known facts about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of total respiratory illnesses 4.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, that is, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with horrific levels of disease severity and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, it was reported that health workers had been infected, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and the city's public transport was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, according to the first clinical trial of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).</seg>
<seg id="28">Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but people between the ages of 30 and 65 were mostly affected.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 was distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei Province and surrounding regions.</seg>
<seg id="34">On average, 5 (2-9) days elapsed from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">An average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days elapsed from the onset of symptoms to death.</seg>
<seg id="37">The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), while the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected people, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (≥ 60) and severe cases of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the envelope spiny processes (S) binds to the cell receptors of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA, together with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% the same as 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using illuminating electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of the human respiratory epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme more weakly than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease in patients than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of virus pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryo-electron tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 times in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host that enabled the virus to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission also remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr. Ji and colleagues hypothesized that snakes were the vectors of the virus from bats to humans, resulting in homologous recombination in the S-protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">Based on the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the laboratory, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating up to 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively block virus activity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so humans are susceptible to the new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4) .4.</seg>
<seg id="70">Typically, a host virus first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ORR), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.</seg>
<seg id="71">Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune reaction.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T cells, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">Helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from a recovering patient neutralized MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">People who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders are more likely to be infected.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A later study described above, based on demographics of 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease who are asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="87">A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for people who had contact with the virus or were infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as a dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients had shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in chest images.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found the following symptom prevalence rates: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="95">Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, a rate much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).</seg>
<seg id="98">The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required by 14-20% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.</seg>
<seg id="100">Compared to this figure, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptom manifestation, mortality rate and R0 is given in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures show a higher potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate if infected with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster manifestation often occurs when an infection occurs within the same family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have found themselves together on some transport, such as a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or came into contact with those infected or sick during the last two weeks before the disease began.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, when discharged from the hospital, can become carriers of the virus again, and this is a wake-up call to extend the quarantine period.</seg>
<seg id="109">At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in their peripheral blood.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with leukocyte levels &lt; 4 × 109/L, including leukocyte levels &lt; 1 × 109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine aminotransferase and viremia.</seg>
<seg id="111">Elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell subsidence.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe disease, levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, were elevated and the number of lymphocytes steadily decreased.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most patients with COVID-19 were found to have pathologies characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or "matt glass" type darkening in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARI).</seg>
<seg id="115">In the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction lowers the level of surfactant compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation, and intertissue lymphocyte infiltration, and multicore syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="119">SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used as the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, given the high level of false-negative results, which can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).</seg>
<seg id="121">The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.</seg>
<seg id="122">Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for applying the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at densities ranging from 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.</seg>
<seg id="124">This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of conducting them.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in resisting a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are mainly able to provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy, while attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2) .2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapies include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressors, steroids, recovered patients' plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">Even the plasma of recovered patients was proposed for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also be less likely to affect other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease, is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functions of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="134">The cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of an overreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="135">A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammation that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which become the main cause of ARI and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">In the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients in a serious condition, immune suppression is essential.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immune suppression-based treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of the immune response to control T cells; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus kinase; and the use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4, and histone deacetalase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">To reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressors.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids in large dosages are not useful in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has proven to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, Remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other viruses with single-stranded RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be monitored with caution.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production</seg>
<seg id="153">Blood collection from patients cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population, has been used for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="154">Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are present in immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and specifically neutralize them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, in order to propose the mass application of this method prior to the implementation of specific therapy, it is necessary to carry out a test and explanations that have not yet been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, given the therapeutic effect, some of the disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma requires a lot to treat patients in a critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.</seg>
<seg id="164">This way we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases for millennia.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective COVID-19 specific therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The highest proportion of recovering patients with COVID-19 was found in a number of provinces in China where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest proportion of recoveries (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a rough comparison, as the assessment must take into account many other influences, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, symptom management, and inpatient care was significantly shorter in patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in patients treated only with Western methods.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to worsen (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only with Western methods (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% vs. 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is also of some interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness aspects of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques, or a combination thereof.</seg>
<seg id="177">Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 generally have a strong fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as all other people who require it.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Work has been done to develop S-protein-based vaccines that aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Animal studies have developed live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, before starting clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in older patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="187">Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS virus disease continue to occur, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.</seg>
<seg id="189">To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (on average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients manage to gradually recover without complications.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high rate of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.</seg>
<seg id="195">It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on clinical trial data presented to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over the age of 50, according to the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (an average of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Morbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.</seg>
<seg id="205">Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase can also predict the result.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are secreted in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Key clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.</seg>
<seg id="212">Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosages and short courses.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As described above, amid the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty, and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological control much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="220">So today's COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious than the SARS epidemic, and harder to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">A lot of work is currently underway in China, which has declared a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extended the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to interrupt the chain of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="222">While these measures are hugely damaging to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being identified is declining, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="223">According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the extinction phase will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues have calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have compiled a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A team of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">But the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an effect.</seg>
<seg id="229">Initial projections suggested that Ebola would affect up to a million people and kill half a million patients.</seg>
<seg id="230">But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in feces, meaning that an oral faecal transmission method is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="235">According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="236">Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers in contact with patients or those infected.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 class respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent microdroplets of fluid from potentially infected from flying in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect virions between 10 and 80 nm in size from inhalation, they allow only 5% of virions to pass through; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 class masks (Series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a figure-fitting protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed type goggles.</seg>
<seg id="245">All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands with disinfectants more frequently, to try to stay away from home in self-isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproduction in person-to-person transmission and that preventing the spread and controlling the disease will not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">The announcement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal loss.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages, rather than reassuring the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly review and improve the public response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unstudied coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak created a sense of relapse of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older persons is also higher than among young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">Deaths as a result of SARS are higher than in COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.</seg>
<seg id="264">Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some of the most important issues remain unresolved, namely:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any moment.</seg>
<seg id="269">Molecular modeling and biochemical samples have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or relapse periodically like the flu?</seg>
<seg id="275">These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.</seg>

<seg id="11">nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, iRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more candidate vaccines have been announced, but little publicly available information is available (presumably in the planning or development stage).</seg>
<seg id="14">Preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites, is carried out in stages I-II, while more accurate and effective doses are determined.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for efficacy in preventing the disease and, at the same time, side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical trials).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamping vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced work on its own vaccine, with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.</seg>
<seg id="20">On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of work on their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On February 8, 2020, OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used to vaccinate against cancer neoantigen.</seg>
<seg id="24">On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the start of testing.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">for the development and production of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="31">The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On March 12, 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even on an accelerated basis, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="33">On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle similar to a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on iRNA.</seg>
<seg id="37">BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced a US $4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is US $29 million.</seg>
<seg id="40">CEPI's other investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, and the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for a national "vaccine bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, stating that "MNA administered subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, eliciting strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization."</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that could possibly be produced in the form of a nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined the resources of IBM's supercomputers, combined with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they may have other benefits in addition to the disease prevention properties.</seg>
<seg id="52">Another randomized trial, which is being conducted in Australia, involves 4,170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Vaccines being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had undergone Phase I human clinical trials, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines under development, two adenoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).</seg>
<seg id="60">A conspiracy theory circulated on social media claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine against it already existed.</seg>
<seg id="61">Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin transforming enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collectrin.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, its enzymatically active domain reaching the surface of lung cells and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extracellular domain ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedaza, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter and is present in Hartnup's disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires priming the S protein with the serine protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE and BRA inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group."</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of contracting pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with an overall risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure of 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">China's mortality rate is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people who suspect infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control, and closing various facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who resemble them outwardly, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cases were mainly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, an unverified publication by the South China branch of the Morning Post suggested that the very first case of infection occurred in a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but began to rise unexpectedly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of cases can be significantly underestimated, in particular due to the many cases with mild symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, has estimated that 60% of the British population will be infected before effective group immunity is developed in the country's population.</seg>
<seg id="23">The statistics include cases of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, have adopted official policies requiring that only minor symptoms not be tested.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on March 16 found that in China, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected by January 23, and that such unreported patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy far exceeded the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the figure could be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common period being 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of those who died had co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account deceased people who have not been tested - for example, in the case of deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4-5 times.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual number." His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the US. Such records with incomplete data are often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify deaths.</seg>
<seg id="39">All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Data vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not time-specific and reflect the performance of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the death rate from the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1 and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and exact duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and may vary depending on location.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boney, a researcher at Pennsylvania State University, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to plateau, and then when the number of available carriers runs out, they start to go out.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen. "</seg>
<seg id="51">The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argues that "everything could be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kuczarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating for perhaps a year or two."</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is developed (perhaps 18 months or more)," physical distancing and other measures will be required.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University believes, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear altogether, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it "can turn into a seasonal disease by breaking out every year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the respiratory tract (mucus), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO says it gets sick in a serious form with the development of respiratory problems in about one in six people.</seg>
<seg id="59">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or a feeling of depression in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">In some infected people, the disease may be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed be placed under strict control and examined for infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="62">The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. The symptom of loss of sense of smell is not yet clear: initial estimates of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom were initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact refers to contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">According to some studies, with an open cough, droplets can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">There is speculation that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during conversation, which are able to remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets may also form during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually airborne.</seg>
<seg id="67">Drops can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="72">There have been cases where tests were positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting the possibility of transmission of the virus prior to the pronounced onset of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Officials at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from a few hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing your hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia in a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 bears a great resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.</seg>
<seg id="82">At the holistic genomic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of the bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.</seg>
<seg id="84">A whole-genome comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (PT-PCR) of the infected secret or computed tomography.</seg>
<seg id="86">The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnosis."</seg>
<seg id="88">WHO has published several protocols for testing RNA on SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="90">It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Usually, a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a yawn smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to identify antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to gain approval for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Characteristic features of symptom imaging on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans include asymmetric peripheral cloudiness by type of matt glass and absence of pleural effusion.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.</seg>
<seg id="97">Because of the similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, when COVID-19 is identified, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.</seg>
<seg id="98">In China, a large study comparing chest CT scans and PCR testing found that while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using napkins when coughing or sneezing, which should be thrown away immediately after use.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in crowded areas.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to prevent transmission, it is also recommended to physically distance oneself from people. Many governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has been able to spread to most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">Health professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting others and eye protection. Contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">The use by governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working to develop solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data - for example, registering a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.</seg>
<seg id="107">If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test is positive, they receive a notification. There are also unfounded theories about how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating, after shriveling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.</seg>
<seg id="112">In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using disinfectants to treat hands on an alcoholic basis with at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="113">The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surfaces can be decontaminated with a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface disinfectant starts to work a minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidon iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day hospital, all spaces in such a facility, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.</seg>
<seg id="117">Medical organizations recommend that you cover your mouth and nose with the back of your elbow or napkin when coughing or sneezing, and immediately throw away used hygiene items.</seg>
<seg id="118">Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.</seg>
<seg id="119">The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main method of infection."</seg>
<seg id="121">The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that using a mask does reduce facial touching.</seg>
<seg id="122">Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">The CDC centers in the United States recommend wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.</seg>
<seg id="124">In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask on public transport or in crowded areas.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials are urging people to make facial fabric masks at home and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their noses and mouths.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government has ordered all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="130">On April 1, Taiwan, which has produced ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks on all passengers on trains and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="131">In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those who cannot purchase masks have been advised to sew them themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="132">Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.</seg>
<seg id="134">Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.</seg>
<seg id="135">People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many governments in regions particularly hard hit by the outbreak are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.</seg>
<seg id="137">The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, as recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced, from 250 (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19) to 50, and later to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing," thus clarifying the purpose of this measure - to reduce physical contact within social connections, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, rather than staying in contact with others in alternative ways.</seg>
<seg id="140">Among others, recommendations have been made to have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to isolate themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that all people in affected areas quarantine themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">Those at high risk were given the strictest quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="144">Individuals who may have come into contact with COVID-19 infected individuals, or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.</seg>
<seg id="145">Strategies to combat the outbreak include containing, suppressing, or mitigating the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="146">Containing the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.</seg>
<seg id="147">At a time when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being directed at mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health systems and societies.</seg>
<seg id="148">Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic's peak, known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">Such efforts reduce the risk of congestion in health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling mass events; engaging the community to facilitate and participate in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, as well as an alert system for the movements of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provided financial support to infected people in self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.</seg>
<seg id="155">Modeling in the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems with mitigating (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stopping the growth of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal policies to mitigate the spread of the disease could reduce the peak burden on the health system by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term intervention to quell the pandemic has social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">There are currently no antiviral drugs approved to treat COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter medication for colds, drinking enough fluids and resting can help relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The WHO also reported that some "traditional and homemade remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">WHO considers improving capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="166">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, abolishing non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and expanding intensive care options by training staff and increasing the number of available IVL devices and beds.</seg>
<seg id="167">There are various theories as to where the very first case of infection may have occurred - the so-called "zero patient."</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">During the month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei Province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">They were mainly related to the Huanan wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at a clinic in Hubei Province, with which doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, reporting the case to the Jianhan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan City on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.</seg>
<seg id="173">Later, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="174">Wuhan health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and major rail hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">According to more recent official data, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.</seg>
<seg id="179">Because of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">As of April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were under some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million people were isolated in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were isolated in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure rose to 2.6 billion - about a third of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the veracity of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">On December 26, Zhang Jian, a doctor, was working on a case of mass pneumonia of an unknown type, and on December 27, her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="184">Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="185">On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="186">WHO was notified the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">In response to such notices, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="188">Initially, the China National Health Commission argued that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed a "people's war" by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.</seg>
<seg id="190">The "largest quarantine in human history" began to unfold, and on January 23, a cordon sanitaire and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan were announced, later extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province and affecting a total of about 57 million people.</seg>
<seg id="191">The city banned the use of private transport.</seg>
<seg id="192">Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.</seg>
<seg id="193">The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Huoshenshan hospital, which was completed in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built to receive other incoming patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and schools were closed across the country.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei Province and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transport schedules were changed and museums across China were temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">Many cities have introduced a regime to control the movement of citizens, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of outdoor travel restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Beijing, for example, has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, there had been only one case of domestic transmission in mainland China that occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely stopped and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, other than Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was quarantined. On March 26, 2020, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for those with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.</seg>
<seg id="206">On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to reopen and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10: 00 a.m., a national three-minute "minute of silence" was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the country's State Council and coinciding with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online by observing physical distancing to avoid a repeat of the COVID-19 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="207">It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.</seg>
<seg id="208">On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely because a large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji had gathered in Taegu.</seg>
<seg id="209">Shinchonji's followers came to Taegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.</seg>
<seg id="211">More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, rising to 3,150 on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers had the virus.</seg>
<seg id="213">The outbreak has affected the number of journeys, hence the airlines' flight schedules have been changed. South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the virus, track contacts and arrange quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile app to everyone from abroad, universal testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, and expanded testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.</seg>
<seg id="215">South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there. Initially, South Korean society was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in a single day for four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports, 121 countries applied to South Korea for help in testing for the virus on April 1.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.</seg>
<seg id="221">Initial measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that the government had no plans to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, plans were announced to restrict long-distance travel, but heavy movement between cities ahead of the Persian New Year continued.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.</seg>
<seg id="226">Amid claims of a cover-up over the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on March 3.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all prisoners who fit this category.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organisation says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day - the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.</seg>
<seg id="231">By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran can be five times higher than the data that are reported at the official level.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="235">The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded an easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of cases has skyrocketed, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, under which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.</seg>
<seg id="240">On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy at the time.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were due to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for prioritizing medical care for patients that may have to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy surpassed China in terms of coronavirus deaths, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, with the majority of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors could contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy - the large number of senior citizens in that country and the inability to screen everyone who currently has coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="247">The United Kingdom has responded to the virus most calmly of all the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.</seg>
<seg id="248">On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people should work from home where possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.</seg>
<seg id="249">On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month, as a measure to support the public during the crisis. On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher measures on social distancing, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to cases of extreme necessity.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.</seg>
<seg id="251">Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide "livelihoods," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.</seg>
<seg id="252">On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed to have the country's first case of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="253">On January 29, a Coronavirus Task Force was established at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="254">On January 31, the Trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions on visitors from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Despite this, population testing in the United States did not begin immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was obscured.</seg>
<seg id="257">Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval until the end of February for the use of non-government test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies, and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by prescription by the attending physician).</seg>
<seg id="258">The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.</seg>

<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's prescription, waited hours or days for their turn for tests."

<seg id="267">Since March 15, many companies have been shutting down or reducing opening hours across the United States, helping to fight the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that 10,700 cases had been reported in New York in 24 hours, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the governor said that social distancing was probably an effective measure, as estimates of a doubling of the number of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As of March 28, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York City and 672 people had died. On March 26, the United States reported more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States, with 12,841 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on March 30, President Trump decided to extend the social distancing period until April 30.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort docked at the Port of New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, there were 884 coronavirus deaths in the United States within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="274">In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 as of April 3. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information that goes public by monitoring, with the help of Vice President Mike Pence's office, public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="275">Overall, President Trump's supporters are divided on how well he is handling the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some officials and observers have criticized US dependence on imports of critical materials, including basic necessities, from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">In mid-January 2020, the journal Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict patterns of disease spread.</seg>
<seg id="278">Based on 2018 data from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.</seg>
<seg id="280">Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali has been named the least prepared for an outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="281">In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.</seg>
<seg id="282">On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="283">Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.</seg>
<seg id="284">Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan has said it is not going to evacuate citizens from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.</seg>
<seg id="287">Citizens of Poland, China and India landed in Poland, where the Brazilian plane made a stop before flying to Brazil according to the route.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens visiting Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near the city of Brasilia.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadian citizens (176 from the first and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan, taken to Canada's Trenton Air Force Base, and quarantined for two weeks.</seg>

<seg id="294">On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.</seg>
<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.</seg>
<seg id="296">A medical examination of the passengers was carried out before the flight, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans with negative tests for coronavirus were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="298">Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.</seg>
<seg id="299">On March 20, the United States began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">Some Chinese students studying at American universities have banded together to collect and send aid to regions of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to clinics in Hubei province on January 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in conjunction with FedEx, sent 200,000 medical masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and bathrobes, by an ambulance to the Wuhan Union clinic by January 30.</seg>
<seg id="302">On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect populations "at risk in Africa and South Asia" from the threat of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="303">Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="304">On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.</seg>
<seg id="305">Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia more than 13 tons of medicine, Malaysia announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicine, and pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="307">Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.</seg>
<seg id="308">Later, he also sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 medical masks, and five IVL machines to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">Ma has also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and testing kits.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, providing accuracy of only 30%, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were believed to have been manufactured in China, but later turned out to have come from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="314">The WHO noted clear differences between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of classifying information that allegedly prevented the disease from being prevented and contained, on the one hand, and the current crisis, in which the central government "regularly provided updates on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."</seg>
<seg id="315">On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Gaudin Galea noted that while "this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO," it was also "a very important reaffirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the point of greatest spread," and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, after confirming the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the growing number of infections in other countries, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="316">The WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said the PHEIC announcement was due to "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.</seg>
<seg id="317">Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international movement and trade," and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."</seg>
<seg id="318">On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that "do not have systems in place to identify people who have contracted the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."</seg>
<seg id="319">Mr. Tedros also stated that "the indicator of our preparedness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link," and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay in the future." At a press conference on February 11, the WHO established the official name of the disease - COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system to respond to the problem."</seg>
<seg id="321">The result was the creation of the UN Crisis Management Group, which coordinates all United Nations responses; these steps, the WHO says, will allow "a focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak more broadly socially and economically."</seg>
<seg id="322">On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint task force that brought together international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation domestically and to assess the "severity and contagion of the disease," organized workshops and meetings with leading national agencies, and conducted field visits to assess "the effectiveness of the provincial and district response, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that" it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="323">When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the likelihood of global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparedness and risk.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet's preparedness for the reality: it is time to act.</seg>
<seg id="325">This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, "and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a" worst-case scenario. "</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan also stated that the current data do not warrant a declaration of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that a declaration of a pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus."</seg>
<seg id="327">On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The WHO Director-General stated that WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the problem." WHO has been heavily criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="329">In response to the situation, a petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, inviting him to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.</seg>
<seg id="330">On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The expert group stated that everyone has the right to be subjected to life-saving measures, and the government is responsible for organizing such measures.</seg>
<seg id="332">The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.</seg>
<seg id="333">The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, members of minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to solicit views and provide recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="336">The digital hub provides information on country-specific policies (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="337">The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action to combat the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="338">A number of provincial leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for the quarantine measures they took in central China, and the dismissals indicated dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with an earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">US President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," a remark that has in turn been criticized by some commentators, who argue that this approach is racist and "distracts from the failure of the US presidential administration to contain the spread of the disease."</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast gained access to a US government cable that contains a communications strategic trick apparently invented by the National Security Council, with references to the strategy: "It's all about China.</seg>
<seg id="343">We are being asked to disseminate this information in any way we can, including press conferences and television appearances. "Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a" propaganda push "to gain global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through PR and so-called generosity politics."</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrell also said that "China is pushing hard for its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US."</seg>
<seg id="346">China has also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to US sanctions imposed on April 3.</seg>
<seg id="348">The US authorities are also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.</seg>
<seg id="349">Medical masks have also been the subject of controversy between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL vehicles destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for coronavirus-ridden Italy.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China has reacted bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">This clearly does not indicate European solidarity. "</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" claiming that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on world public opinion at a "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.</seg>
<seg id="357">Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide reciprocal assistance if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="360">NATO's Defender 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states - NATO's largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War - will be conducted in a reduced format.</seg>
<seg id="361">Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In today's public health crisis, this exercise endangers the lives not only of the US military and many European member states, but also of residents of the countries where such events are to be held."</seg>
<seg id="362">On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country is struggling to combat the epidemic due to a lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave, and increased funding for public health.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="364">South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine in designated government locations.</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators have expressed concern that the move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban indefinite power to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to deal with the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages due to a global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic buying and disruptions to manufacturing and logistics operations.</seg>
<seg id="370">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="371">Panic buying also took place in several localities; this led to a situation where basic goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.</seg>
<seg id="374">This jump led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical products for four to six months.</seg>
<seg id="375">It has also caused shortages of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, due to the pandemic, Daigou buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">These activities led to shortages of baby food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high demand for food, severe food shortages were avoided in both areas.</seg>
<seg id="378">Measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products, which have been successful, have avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry officials say agricultural prices could rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">Grocery store shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.</seg>
<seg id="381">Similar laws requiring food producers to maintain food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy has taken its toll on China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5% decline in retail sales.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, the viral outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="384">Agathe Demarai of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that market volatility will persist until there is a clearer picture of potential outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="386">According to one estimate by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It is reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take "urgent measures" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, global stock markets plummeted due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, amid growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S &amp; P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points - the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="390">At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.</seg>
<seg id="391">On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Stocks fell again on concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop coming on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.</seg>
<seg id="395">Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to undertake any travel.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for flights, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.</seg>
<seg id="398">The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="401">National and regional governments canceled a number of high-profile events, including annual New Year's Eve festivals; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many New Year's Eve events were canceled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent crowds; for example, Beijing closed the Forbidden City and canceled traditional temple fairs.</seg>
<seg id="403">In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open before that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's Eve celebrations. The retail sector has suffered globally, with store opening hours reduced and some stores temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50-60%.</seg>
<seg id="408">As a result, in March, attendance at shopping malls fell by 33-43% compared to February.</seg>
<seg id="409">According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession in Latin America could leave 14-22 million more people out of poverty than would have been the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.</seg>
<seg id="411">Many of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.</seg>
<seg id="412">The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that a coronavirus outbreak in the United States could put 47 million people out of work, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India would put tens of millions of Indian migrant workers out of work on a daily basis. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced unemployment in one way or another. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single welfare payment.</seg>
<seg id="414">A German part-time pay scheme has also been introduced in France and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="415">The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="416">Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage for the public, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting people of the arts.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely, or access to them was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events, and performances were canceled or rescheduled.</seg>
<seg id="418">Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.</seg>
<seg id="419">There have also been disruptions in the film industry. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live, or television, while some church leaders suggest holding services outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.</seg>
<seg id="422">Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events have been canceled or rescheduled, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season.</seg>
<seg id="425">The coronavirus outbreak also ruined plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or canceled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This has led to many players going online, with many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also canceled all of their performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps artists continue to perform, produce or publish their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">Numerous online memes on the subject of coronavirus have appeared online, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxious moods that characterize periods of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against members of the population of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="431">Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="432">News reports in February (when most infections were still limited to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for anything.</seg>
<seg id="433">Some African countries are also seeing a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.</seg>
<seg id="435">Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported both offline and online.</seg>
<seg id="436">The epidemic has begun to spread to new countries, notably Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19; citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (# ChineseComeToJapan) led the way on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report rising levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," a view that critics see as racist and anti-Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="440">In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanzhar.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in India's major cities have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="442">Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them."</seg>
<seg id="443">In China, the pandemic has reignited xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being called "foreign garbage" and objects to be "disposed of."</seg>
<seg id="444">Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="445">Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.</seg>
<seg id="446">Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change, or therapeutic redirection of drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally envisioned in development.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each with multiple ligand-binding sites.</seg>
<seg id="4">The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP-ribophosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that will be recommended for clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being investigated in the Solidarity clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="10">The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDC stated that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="12">Doctors say they use the drug when there is "no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="13">A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.</seg>
<seg id="14">Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="15">The New York University School of Medicine in Langone is studying the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipyravir is "uniquely effective."</seg>
<seg id="17">Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had a negative result after an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Wuhan, a study followed 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received Favipiravir and the other half received Umiphenovir.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that results showing the drug's efficacy are scarce and should not be considered final.</seg>
<seg id="20">On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan to replenish its supplies, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in neglected cases of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to conceive.</seg>
<seg id="23">One study on the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that "no efficacy of the drugs was found."</seg>
<seg id="24">The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.</seg>
<seg id="25">A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community has criticized the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically developed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="26">The WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.</seg>
<seg id="27">Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences discovered that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on patients with a moderate form of the disease and the other on patients with a more severe form.</seg>
<seg id="30">Three trials are currently underway for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).</seg>
<seg id="31">On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State.</seg>
<seg id="32">Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teigin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for use in the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is being conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the efficacy of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="34">Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="35">For the study, called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="36">Pregnant women who are breastfeeding and do not use effective contraception cannot participate in this study.</seg>
<seg id="37">Several coagulants are being tested in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Authority to publish guidelines for the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="39">On April 14, a multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.</seg>
<seg id="40">Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.</seg>

<seg id="1">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Proper risk control in the workplace depends on the location and work task, is based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home for signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This category may include workers in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some large retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers that medical and morgue personnel who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection with COVID-19 are considered to be at high risk, with the risk increasing to very high when such personnel perform aerosol procedures or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.</seg>
<seg id="10">The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commercial patterns may vary with respect to both the types of goods in demand and the manner in which such goods are purchased (for example, making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to organize protection.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.</seg>
<seg id="18">The response is influenced by the severity of the illnesses in the community where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="20">If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19 disease, the most effective engineering and technical means of safety, then - administrative measures and, finally, means of personal protection.</seg>
<seg id="21">Safety engineering involves isolating employees from work-related risk areas and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the employee, suitable in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that positions with the least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including covering the mouth with a hand when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="27">Quickly identifying and isolating individuals who could potentially be infected is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the heat stops, no elevated body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other medications to address the symptoms, and mandates that policies be flexible on sick leave, that employees be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of such policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or due to recent trips by such a person to COVID-19 distribution sites.</seg>
<seg id="30">These categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, high-density work environments, and some large retail stores. Safety engineering for such groups and groups at higher risk includes the installation of high-performance air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such a group and groups at higher risk include advising sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, setting up shift schedules, ending non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protective measures, training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, and ensuring that workers have access to the right tools and resources.</seg>
<seg id="31">In rare cases, workers at risk may be required to wear respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">If a person falls ill on an airplane, measures such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, providing the sick person with a mask, or asking such a person to cover their nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure proper safety of employees and other passengers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, regular coughing or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing the medical center on the ship in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, a medical examination should take place in the isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a minimal or medium level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling trips for face-to-face meetings, gatherings, and other mass events such as exercise or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, adjusting arrival and care times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate health facility location for children with influenza symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for prolonged absenteeism may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">Law enforcement officials who are required to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the event of close contact during detention, employees should clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment prior to reuse with household cleaning sprays or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, and use and wash clothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="42">They have a very high risk of infection during aerosol procedures or during the collection/processing of samples from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include probing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk morgue workers include those who treat the bodies of people with a confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such employees perform an autopsy, they are placed in a very high-risk category. Additional engineering safety features for such at-risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with a confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19, including for procedures involving aerosol formation.</seg>
<seg id="45">In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions provided for biosafety level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be assigned to designated waiting areas based on suspected COVID-19 infection. Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting up to 6 feet away with patients with a confirmed illness or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those performing aerosol procedures.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the United States, NIOSH-approved facial respirators with an N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of overalls, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratory rather than through physiological fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The WHO recommends using only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the point of admission.</seg>
<seg id="51">WHO recommends that those who collect samples from the respiratory tract of patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation wear a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, bathrobe and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">For procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using remote medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, providing access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only to those who provide direct care, using only those personal protective equipment that is necessary for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing, when working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and advising against the use of masks for those without symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most cases are reduced to mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease spills over into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people have died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread by people in close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by hitting the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (PT-PCR) on a sample taken as a smear from the nasopharynx.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of having the disease, as well as those who care for them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the public vary: some agencies recommend against using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of compression in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.</seg>
<seg id="18">Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat, may be less common.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are also gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in different percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of compression in the chest and heart palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all those infected.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="27">China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) had refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">In loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in normal volume speech.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that when the cough is open, droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.</seg>
<seg id="31">The virus is not usually airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.</seg>
<seg id="34">Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">These figures, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a rather useful effect in terms of combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to eliminate it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="39">In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first discovered in three people with pneumonia in a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="42">Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus connects to ACE2 and enters the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "spike" (peplomer).</seg>
<seg id="45">12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe forms of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers because they are involved in the work of this organ.</seg>
<seg id="48">A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate unfavorable prognosis. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lymphocytic infiltrates were also found during the autopsy.</seg>
<seg id="52">The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.</seg>
<seg id="54">The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples taken with a nasopharyngeal smear, but a nasal or sputum smear sample can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results are not directly relevant.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development but not yet widespread.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test for on-site diagnosis, authorizing its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University specify methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral multipleural subpleural seal foci of the "matt glass" type with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone pavement (a lobed thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main results of the pathological examination performed during the autopsy:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung seal and edema</seg>
<seg id="66">There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:</seg>
<seg id="67">mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multi-nucleus giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, following respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="74">After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygienic procedure for the hands.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by those with asymptomatic disease. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact between infected patients and large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed, citizens' movement has been restricted, and major public events have been canceled.</seg>
<seg id="76">The distancing guidelines also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are limited to reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as "plateauing."</seg>
<seg id="78">The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating and after shriveling, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">The CDC also recommends the use of an alcohol-containing disinfectant (at least 60% alcohol content) for hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic treatment of hands.</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.</seg>
<seg id="83">Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">To strengthen the immune system, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published guidelines for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some medical professionals recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="91">When performing procedures that may result in airborne discharge, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in health facilities.</seg>
<seg id="92">Medical professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in an air-drip isolation unit (AIIR) - an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contact and air. The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended personal protective equipment: a protective bathrobe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above products, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when not used according to instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="96">If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face screens or, as a last resort, making the masks yourself at home.</seg>
<seg id="97">In most cases, the forms of the COVID-19 flow are not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective for patients in a critical condition as IVL.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical lung ventilation if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those over 60, and especially those over 80) is much higher.</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and health system resources are too limited to cope with the surge in severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="104">The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is becoming more difficult as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops in COVID-19, and oxygenation cause more and more problems.</seg>
<seg id="105">IVL with inhalation pressure support and PDKV are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which can result in the development of pneumothorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">On earlier fan models, high PDKV may not be available.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.</seg>
<seg id="109">Development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="111">WHO-recommended volunteers are taking part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.</seg>
<seg id="112">Its use has not been subjected to clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to fight the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect "close contact" using surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence - such tools are used to track infected people and individuals they have come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security agencies permission to track the mobile phone data of people believed to be infected with the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="119">Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said cellular network operators report that "40% of people continue to move around the territory anyway."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and wellbeing."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while it can take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.</seg>
<seg id="129">Pregnant women may be at higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.</seg>
<seg id="130">In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.</seg>
<seg id="132">Thrombosis abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while kidney dysfunction was observed in 4% of this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to early case studies, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological studies of posthumous lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibroxoid exudates in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.</seg>
<seg id="140">The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8% of the deaths recorded by China's National Health Commission, heart problems included elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had prior health problems.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of mortality vary by condition due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">Insufficiently effective counting of cases in a mild form can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The administration of a clinic in Hong Kong found that some patients who recovered from the disease had their lung volume reduced by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">After recovery, it can also lead to "After Intensive Care" syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus were developing persistent immunity against it.</seg>
<seg id="150">Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where coronavirus tests were still positive after recovery from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="151">It is believed that in these cases there was an aggravated prolonged course of the disease, rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is believed to be natural, of animal origin and an infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="154">A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, cites December 1, 2019 as the earliest date for the first case.</seg>
<seg id="155">According to official data published by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">All figures vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease, and are also influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes to the disease: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who die as a result of the disease, and determining the disease-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who die as a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not time-specific and reflect the performance of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have suffered an infection, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to understand how many people have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="163">At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.</seg>
<seg id="165">Moreover, Germany's health care system has not been overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="166">In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, according to blood donation figures.</seg>
<seg id="167">COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.</seg>
<seg id="170">The group most at risk is men over the age of 50; the gender gap narrows only from the age of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and co-morbidities in men (for example, hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) may cause higher mortality among men.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="176">Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ARVI have different gender statistics.</seg>
<seg id="177">The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, so they are more likely to get infected.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Ghebreyesus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease," and 19 is the year the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species, or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19."</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, in line with 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, the WHO recommended the use of the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names for the virus and disease.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to restrictions on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials such as nasal swab swabs and IVL parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, when one of the local facilities was repurposed and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.</seg>
<seg id="188">Since the COVID-19 outbreak first erupted, various conspiracy theories, misinformation, and fake information about the virus's origin, scope, prevention, treatment, and other aspects have spread rapidly on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">Studies have not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">There is currently no approved vaccine against the virus or drugs to treat it.</seg>
<seg id="192">Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered the most effective to date.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidate drugs for the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three vaccination strategies.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers are seeking to create a whole-virion vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response by the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating a vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-bodily enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.</seg>
<seg id="205">Drugs approved for malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. To the same end, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, preliminary data on the efficacy of remdesivir are available.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir as an exception.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there is a need for peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also list interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir as anti-COVID-19 agents.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary evidence suggests that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">Nitazoxanide has been recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires the priming of the spike protein by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).</seg>
<seg id="217">Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of the severe form of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinetic properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="220">This drug has entered the second stage of a non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combined with a blood serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="224">The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but the results have been inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="226">Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.</seg>
<seg id="229">The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia limit the number of packs of toilet paper that can be purchased in one go</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packs that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one pack respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, ALDI also imposed a limit on one package.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions were reported in ads at box offices, as well as on the network's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">Citizens have reportedly started making emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.</seg>
<seg id="8">Retailer Coles said in a press release on March 8 that with the four-pack limit in place, "many stores are still selling toilet paper too quickly - one delivery within an hour," and called such demand "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post published on Tuesday, called the trend "unexpected."</seg>
<seg id="9">A Woolworths spokesman said there had been a surge in sales last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that number to two packages.</seg>
<seg id="11">To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stock for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish stock, but this was being hampered by local government restrictions on truck timetables.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were unable to hold promotions on Wednesdays due to depletion of stock.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report to news.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores were restocking every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of inventory is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the sense of stock shortages.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and products such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn't panic like that," says Russell Zimmerman.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last Wednesday, the maker of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, announced the end of stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a report by news.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure there were enough products.</seg>
<seg id="20">Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during the Labor Day holiday week, some property sellers began offering free toilet paper to first bidders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Thursday edition of the Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the amount of goods they purchased, saying they had no plans to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, haberdashery, hand washing products and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.</seg>

<seg id="4">DATE/TIME OF REFERENCE: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">DECISIONS: CC0: No protected rights</seg>
<seg id="6">This month we are living in unusual circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate, and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">We observed a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in e-mails, calls and chats - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the operability of sites, payment by our colleagues or to protect the safety of communities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="15">At such a time, to achieve meaningful results for the world, what matters is not only what we do, but also how we do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together, starting in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjusting the order of our work and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As previously stated by Robin, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the conversation, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to retreat, let it be so.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all staff, contractors and freelancers:</seg>
<seg id="23">We expect that it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not announce days off: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether it's taking care of your family, buying food, or going to a doctor's appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not monitor your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you get sick, you shouldn't work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no need to take sick leave or time off: just inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Brian from T &amp; C Ops so that T &amp; C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation).</seg>
<seg id="31">Payment of hourly rates will be made in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you cannot work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do can bring amazing results, especially at times like this.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, it's about self-help.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some types of work are considered essential.</seg>
<seg id="41">We should always support such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">A slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to work "twice as hard to catch up" once the pandemic is over.</seg>
<seg id="47">You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.</seg>
<seg id="48">We recognise that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and timelines where possible.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens to APP (annual plans)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.</seg>
<seg id="51">We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help, and caring for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work is provided with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">This extension significantly reduces the current planning workload and tensions across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, risks and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="59">The building has its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located on the WeWork network, which has shared its COVID-19 policies with us and all DC staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last week, our office in the District of Columbia moved completely to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting space in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a course of several days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out materials for review in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.</seg>
<seg id="71">For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as a person responsible for keeping notes (or joint summary).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need to use a convenient headset, please contact technical support by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="73">Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Connect to the # remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR Operations team is reviewing the ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons," until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out coordinated grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such targets.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.</seg>
<seg id="79">The general mood in the global community is not only grief at the interruption, but also some sense of relief at the mutual understanding and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="80">Looking ahead, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.</seg>
<seg id="81">We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC/07: 00 PT.</seg>
<seg id="83">This time we will take the opportunity to additionally share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting to each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are together in such a situation and are ready to help everything we can.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can still receive information from such e-mails, and other important information about COVID-19 - from Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have any questions about travel, events, key workflow, lighting problems or other assistance, please contact CRT.</seg>
<seg id="89">We stand ready to provide support and communication as needed.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have privacy concerns, contact Bryan Judan, director of HR International Global Operations, by email.</seg>
<seg id="91">No such change should be seen as a repudiation of our work and our commitments.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and enable us to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.</seg>
<seg id="96">For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work to your maximum potential as soon as the need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">And now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).</seg>

<seg id="1">Diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief reference guide to the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides insights into our experiences and calibrated recommendations for fighting the pandemic around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Coronavirus Infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the "Diagnostic and Therapy Guidelines for COVID-19" (version 7) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, the WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">This publication attracted a lot of attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the "Diagnostic and Therapy Guidelines for COVID-19," published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were published, with some of its provisions changing significantly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, a paper prepared by Zhou and co-authors commented on our recommendations and contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as providing valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to the latest issue of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19 (trial seventh version) and the results of ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspected disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in and around Wuhan or other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of individuals with confirmed illnesses (≥ 2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms reported within 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="18">Diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on a case of suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome-wide virus sequencing shows high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, or a titer increase of at least 4 times during the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of this document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then the need for serological proof was added in the seventh issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the results of continuous work by researchers searching for the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and promotes the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, there is growing evidence of the need for caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, the route map presented in the paper by Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The assessment system also requires refinement in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we encourage readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 in a day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths were reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="10">An employee of the clinic told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Meitri Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be shut down for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Public transport was halted from 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.</seg>
<seg id="13">The transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was still permitted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the scale of the disease, not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take action:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries together are still in a position to influence the course of the pandemic."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is possible if countries are engaged in identifying, testing, treating, isolating patients, tracking cases, and mobilizing their citizens, "explained WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus besides influenza has yet been tracked from its onset to its continuous global spread."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before. "</seg>
<seg id="11">First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then gave it a new status - a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 people have died.</seg>

<seg id="5">Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in hospital or absent altogether.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">By March 23, no country had been able to verify more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be greatly exaggerated in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Using a polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on samples from the respiratory tract obtained in a variety of ways, including a nasopharyngeal smear or a sputum sample.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are usually available for a period of a few hours to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The OT-PCR test, carried out on swabs taken from the throat, is only valid for the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, while continuing to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken as an alternative using a suction catheter, or weaning products (sputum) can be used.</seg>
<seg id="16">One early PCR test was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It identifies an "E" gene common to all beta coronaviruses and an RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of a PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time PCR diagnostic panel (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency permit for use. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the collection and processing of tests must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology "VEKTOR."</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Application Authorization (EUA) to Abbott labs to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 review of the specialized literature concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear."</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features identified during CT scans include bilateral multi-longitudinal subpleural seal foci of the "matt glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone pavement, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnosis." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population control. Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)</seg>
<seg id="39">In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.</seg>
<seg id="40">CLT typically uses a single peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="41">In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection stage is not required for test testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="44">Testing performance is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased produced satisfactory results.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: "emergency department staff pass a test tube to the patient for a sample," the patient spits it in, gives it back and receives the test results after a while. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient.</seg>
<seg id="47">Rapid testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day on an outpatient basis, and a week earlier, they could do only 10,700 tests a week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's total testing performance is 160,000 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="52">The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining the samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called Huo-Yan (Chinese for "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also have been twice as high.</seg>
<seg id="54">Following the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai - in a total of 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits have been released that can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, due to a shortage and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US had become problematic.</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols, which involve heating samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the amount of coronavirus testing the United Arab Emirates currently conducts per capita exceeds that of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was due to rapid testing capabilities, along with the acquisition of a mass population testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">Deployed in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of PT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of manufacturing test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was not available until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the United States. At the start of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">But in South Korea, experts say the widespread availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing created by the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overwhelmed, and supplies of smear tests and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">The American test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws," and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of the tests. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be unsuccessful sampling or improper use of the kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said it would withdraw the inaccurate kits and replace them with other kits - Shenzhen Bioeasy kits. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China yielded incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovic proposed dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an official at the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "did not use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, it was announced that the kits were unusable.</seg>
<seg id="71">Quarantine measures for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients came into contact, had positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a man from COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">The entrance to the village was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="75">With intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic was much less intense than in other developed countries, and it did not have to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay home, but schools that had ended their holidays on March 23 opened as scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="78">The statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following graph, the "% positive results" column depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive percentage than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether they have symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rapidly growing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between January 1 and March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was the causative agent of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to currently available data, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with the majority recovering.</seg>
<seg id="8">In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% it takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">This study analyzes trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compares them with trends in Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020 - all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, are in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Determination of the cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8: 00 a.m. the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data are used to analyze trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was calculated over 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8: 00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">Trends in truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK were broadly in line with trends observed in Hubei Province of China (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, with a sharp jump on 28 February 2020 (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8: 00 am on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">Observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in the response of national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including "catch-up" testing.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already as full as possible.</seg>
<seg id="33">Currently, data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, such data need to be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data, which focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that other countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for modeling health system resource utilization with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases are currently grouped into specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 contact infection, which has been unrelenting for a long time, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reported in the ECDC's latest rapid risk assessment report, a rapid, proactive, and integrated approach, with a consequent shift from containment to mitigation, is essential to containing the spread of SARS-COV-2, because, given the projected rapid increase in disease, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, adopt, and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Countries have only a short period of time during which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, over millennia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China in late 2019 brought renewed attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmissibility but weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="6">Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The identification of carrier animals has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interaction of animals that carry coronaviruses may also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and modes of interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of envelope viruses with a single positive-polar strand of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses, with the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.</seg>
<seg id="17">In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab replicase.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Other coronavirus lineages also encode a number of liniespeculiar accessory proteins.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses), with beta coronaviruses including most human coronaviruses and dividing into four lines (A, B, C, and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="24">For millennia, coronaviruses have continually overcome interspecific barriers, and some have evolved to become dangerous pathogens for humans.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five beta coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and extracellular symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted colds in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, extensive research has led to more detailed knowledge of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and an overall mortality rate of approximately 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">A decade later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-running epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">A wake-up call has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, originating from bats, mice, or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties but exhibit wide genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">It may also prompt or accelerate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is essential to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">This review provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also analyze the trend in the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of nasopharyngeal patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="49">Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; the virus later adapted to reproduction in WI-38 lung cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and cough occurring in 10-20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and a subsequent serial passage into the brains of sucker mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those of the HCoV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous worldwide and are usually transmitted in winter at temperate latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="55">Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Few immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.</seg>
<seg id="58">The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemic, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">Excluding overactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect about two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="63">Common laboratory deviations from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples, and elevated levels of creatine kinase.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and elevated macrophage levels.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for immunocompromised patients.</seg>
<seg id="67">For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, great efforts have been devoted to the study of human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="69">In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was first found to mainly affect young children, the elderly and immunocompromised and respiratory patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">The virus has been found in the Netherlands, but it is actually ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory illnesses, with the peak of the illnesses it causes occurring in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.</seg>
<seg id="76">HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been linked to the exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="78">Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory disease, has been detected worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four of these human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections, have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but various European countries and Tunisia have reported imported cases and spread through episodic secondary cases of infection through close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, there have been more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">Between mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now, in retrospect, linked to an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside it - 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also have diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the diseases they cause.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Thirdly, in terms of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there are also interesting patterns characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e., infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after transitioning through humans.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">On the other hand, it may be that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.</seg>
<seg id="114">Human coronaviruses, which cause severe disease in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause severe disease, simply did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus fully adapts to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">For years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.</seg>
<seg id="120">The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to persist and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is very easily transmitted as an out-of-hospital HCoV, at least for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="124">But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and will circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="127">An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="128">The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly carries HCoV over time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate quickly and then transmit it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can tolerate a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.</seg>
<seg id="134">In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural tank carrier.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and commercial animals (game).</seg>
<seg id="137">Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus compared to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, it has been reported that Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering markets were in most cases not identified by SARS-CoV, suggesting that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifier and not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifiers.</seg>
<seg id="142">They all appear to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier, SARS-CoV, revealed a closely related CoV bat, which has been called the SARS-associated horseshoe bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, other than one designated WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</seg>
<seg id="149">WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, has been shown to use ACE2 bats, civets, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">Today, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.</seg>
<seg id="154">CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to those of bat betacoronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats is only 87% the same.</seg>
<seg id="158">That is, the bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-humped camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of one-humped camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive virus secretion.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus secretion in bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have no history of contact with camels before symptoms occur and are plausible due to human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels involving unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% the same as that of the CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to be attributed to parental relationships.</seg>
<seg id="166">That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely case of transmission from the animal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have carried the parent betacoronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85-92% the same as SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.</seg>
<seg id="171">They are clustered into two sublines of virus differentiation, similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.</seg>
<seg id="172">On the contrary, the RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the identification of viral contigs in lung samples that appeared to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">This study used other assembly and manual processing techniques to produce a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="179">While the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology across the genome.</seg>
<seg id="180">Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.</seg>
<seg id="181">The opposite proposal favors recombination between pangolin betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">The bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate carrier may have been camelids.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission events in history.</seg>
<seg id="190">When interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and humans became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Bat alpha-coronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between them is the alpaca alpha-coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="194">Some data supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronavirus caused a bout of respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alpaca alpha-coronavirus has not been found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas received alpha-coronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while bat alpha-coronaviruses may have served as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and one-humped camels may have been intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to one-humped camels and from one-humped camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.</seg>
<seg id="205">Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats "ideal distributors."</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-humped camels decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="208">He adapted well to these camels, which evolved from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="209">In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">Future studies should confirm or rule out several possibilities for interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.</seg>
<seg id="218">People contract the virus through cutting carcasses and eating wildlife meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third form that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of carrier animals, three major factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to one-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution favorable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 'end of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">During the transcription of coronavirus DNA in a carrier that serves as a mixing vessel, filament switching often occurs.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-carrier interaction with respect to transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.</seg>
<seg id="243">In this article, the recombination of SARS-CoV is given as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on the RSD of the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RSD of the coronavirus protein S interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.</seg>
<seg id="246">RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318th to 510th, on a fragment of S1, which binds to the human angiotensin transforming enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="247">The RSD of the SARS-CoV virus is capable of recognizing APF2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, enabling interspecific transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD, which differ from human viral strains and civets, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">SARS-CoV civets have mutations of K479N and S487T in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein's interaction with the human APF2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the S protein means that the binding affinity of the S protein to human APF2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study using a cryo-electron microscope says that the affinity of this bond is 10-20 times higher than between human APF2 and the S protein of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from host animals.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecific HCoV transmission is also controlled by other carrier dependency and restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, one-humped camels, and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">For successful interspecies transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp dependency factors and subordinate carrier restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-carrier interaction still need to be defined and categorized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Impartial genome-wide screening of media dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can yield good results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="270">This deletion breaks ORF8 down into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombination localizations have also been identified in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to undergo recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in one-humped camels in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of ridding the virus of selection pressures, such as from the carrier's immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to bi-nucleotide deletion.</seg>
<seg id="277">While the intact open ORF4 reading frame can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-coronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insertion that causes the frame to shift.</seg>
<seg id="278">Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the selection pressure on their tank carriers.</seg>
<seg id="279">When bats were infected with coronaviruses, mild or no symptoms were recorded, suggesting mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.</seg>
<seg id="280">It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the April inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen species, which are provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can inhibit coronavirus replication, while affecting exoribonuclease reading, thus creating selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when infiltrated into a new carrier, turn out to be highly pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="285">So it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They replicate confidently without triggering a strong immune response in the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response does not involve coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of untying the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.</seg>
<seg id="293">Thus, taking type I interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is impaired in bats.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.</seg>
<seg id="297">While bat betacoronavirus has been found to have a 95% SARS-CoV nucleotide homology, there is also a bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology is 96% SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although civets and other animals in the markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been directly installed.</seg>
<seg id="299">Pangolin beta coronaviruses, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, have been found, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers, or that gene fragments of pangolin beta coronaviruses may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.</seg>
<seg id="301">Coronaviruses have gained national attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoir animals in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">Strong evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.</seg>
<seg id="304">If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing game markets and destroying civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of pangolin betacoronavirus lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this may occur, remains a challenge for future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in one-humped camels.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels serve as an important means of transport, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate around the world.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the harsh tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural reservoirs until it is possible to seize new territories.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although many of the properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, teaching people to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="321">A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future disease outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">The zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate carrier, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.</seg>
<seg id="329">Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
