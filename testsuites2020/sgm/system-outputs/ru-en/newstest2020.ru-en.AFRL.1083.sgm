<seg id="1">The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, i.e., in the identification of persons (") who may have been in contact with an infected person contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several applications have been developed to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="4">This has given rise to a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched an application. working on Bluetooth, helping to track contacts with potentially infected people and providing operational connection with health authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration with the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (Â« StopCovid).</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application with the function of, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, professor of security, University of Cambridge, outlines a number of potential practical problems that could arise with application-based systems, including false triggers and potential inefficiencies if the is used by only a small portion of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious Îcoronavirus applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their applications related to in the App Store to include in this list "or other trusted organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through applications associated with coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappears.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of oversight.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations announced eight conditions for their public projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be Â« lawful, necessary and proportionate;</seg>
<seg id="21">Expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by reservations about the limitation clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">Data use should be limited to to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;</seg>
<seg id="26">Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter deutscher Grenzen) have also published their lists of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the issue of ongoing surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as the need disappears.</seg>
<seg id="29">In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, eliminating the need to download the application and avoiding tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions that have access to source location data also have big potential privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a special app application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="35">The government has not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contact with infected individuals, but it has also made information about the location publicly available, which has been made possible by significant changes in the information protection legislation that have been introduced since the MERS outbreak in this country.</seg>
<seg id="36">Access to such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized and confidential systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.</seg>
<seg id="38">The contacts which maintains confidentiality â is an established concept, a significant amount of research literature on which dates at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020 more than ten expert groups have been working on solutions that ensure privacy, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register a user proximity to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">But PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, which include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy trace (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure privacy tracking mobile contact tracking (PACT) and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and that all comparisons occur on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy while collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work of this platform is based on research from Apple Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic published in March 2020 developed by Enigma MPC., in the paper ÅApps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic published in March 2020, which was originally founded by MIT Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses robust hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of this data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was founded by groups sharing the same approach, and using similar protocols, of which is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alert applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.</seg>
<seg id="46">10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the work of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claimed would ensure privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology to be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Deployment of tools to enable governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with the coronavirus, but with data privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance, first by implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand-washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a the process of hands to remove impurities, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted faecally orally.</seg>
<seg id="3">A person may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example if he touches the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five critical moments during the day after which it is to wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after cooking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after the procedures for caring for the sick person.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or washing the child down the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After shrieking, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching the animals, feed or waste of animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand washing before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This procedure is especially important for people who are preparing food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,</seg>
<seg id="16">And also reduces the infant mortality rate in domestic births.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.</seg>
<seg id="21">Reducing the number of cases of diarrhoea by 48% can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARDs), provided appropriate habits are developed in each home, in schools and other public places around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nearly 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after the toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhoea by nearly half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under WASH).</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing also prevents impetigo Î£ disease, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, consequently, damage to it.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that too-frequent hand washing can lead to itching and skin sagging â to a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Too often hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before / after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some other cases where it is necessary to wash their hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling. after touching animals, or animal waste, after touching the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, hand-washing with soap is quite common procedure.</seg>
<seg id="33">In developing countries, hand-washing is a A 2014 study found on hand-washing that the highest rate was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the 2015 in 54 countries, showed that, on average, of 38.7% of households washing their hands with soap Î£ is closer to the middle, 77%; the lowest rate was recorded common practice. A study in the</seg>
<seg id="34">The Emergency Medical Care Program, implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education of the, is an example of large-scale interventions to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the heart of this national programme is based on deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily hand-washing with soap and daily fluorine cleaning with.</seg>
<seg id="36">The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removing microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during washing process.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water itself is not considered an effective means to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the process of purification.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to reusable use, can also contain bacteria that can get onto it with the previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies on the skin bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap point to the low probability of such exposure of the, as the bacteria are washed away with foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Central Committee still argues that "liquid soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand-washing".</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that have antibiotic resistance by nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other chores (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health of the.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water is comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 Â° C.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, to remove natural fats containing pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">A hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in the form of gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, the convenience of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick,, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi. as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus,</seg>
<seg id="58">Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (the logarithm of a reduction of 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% â 99.99% of bacteria (the logarithm of a reduction of 4 â 5) on the hands 1 minute after use.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol to</seg>
<seg id="60">The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers over the entire length, grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends opting for hand washing rather than using use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="62">The increasing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening agents and / or skin moisturizers.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the product.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing mitigating components caused significantly less irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in favour of choosing disinfectants compared with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Despite its effectiveness, water-free remedies do not clean hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, as pathogenic microorganisms are still on hand when used.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of disinfectant for alcohol-free hands depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.</seg>
<seg id="71">Most recently, it has been proven that the drugs in which benzalconium chloride is used have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, as opposed to which has been proven to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.</seg>
<seg id="76">If soap is unavailable, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.</seg>
<seg id="77">To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. recommends using a recommend hand-washing techniques that includes the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the water temperature just doesn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the rear side of your palms, as well as areas between your fingers and under your nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="82">Your hands for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you crack your hands, the more microbes are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Carefully rinse your hands under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Wraping hands in standing water can trigger re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="86">Cut your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.</seg>
<seg id="87">Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted. Most often people leave unattended areas such as thumb, wrist, the areas between fingers and under nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is often recommended to use moisturising lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="90">If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes done and (or) using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (for example, in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as foot pedal cranes and other low-cost options.</seg>
<seg id="91">A crane with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever, which should be pressed so that a piece of soap should be used. on the hands, and the water is..</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the production of paper napkins and towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern streaming air dryers for hands.</seg>
<seg id="95">It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of fingers on average increases by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">It also turned out that after washing and drying hands in the air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the toes of the fingers increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the toes of the fingers is reduced to 76% on average, and on the palms of the hands to 77%.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h, 400 miles / h), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet rooms and bathroom within a radius of up to 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">Using hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.</seg>
<seg id="100">When using paper towels, no significant spread of microorganisms has been detected. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess various hand drying methods.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying hands.</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">Hand cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution while traveling in the absence of soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">An alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The medical method of hand washing became obligatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemmelweiss discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital conditions.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff about the need to wash their hands if they forget.</seg>
<seg id="107">According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the infection rate.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with lots of soap, water or gel used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands should be carefully rubbed on each other, scraping their fingers.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is dirt under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying your hands, closing the tap, and closing and opening any doors, if necessary, you should use a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="113">This avoids repeated hand contamination of the hands from these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of hand-washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="116">According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%.</seg>
<seg id="117">The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.</seg>
<seg id="118">The review was co-authored by Whitby.</seg>
<seg id="119">If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and check hand hygiene of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization denotes â  five moments when you need to wash your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">After contact with blood or biological fluids,</seg>
<seg id="122">Before using the antiseptic as well as</seg>
<seg id="123">After patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap when washing your hands ("medical Â» or Â« Â» antimicrobial soap) helps to destroy bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with high content of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="125">All decorations must be taken down.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually for within 2 â 6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need to rub your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="128">During rinsing, water with the forearms should not fall back on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the washing is, the hands dry with sterile tissue and wear a surgical robe.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after procedures to care for a sick person.</seg>
<seg id="131">To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of hand-washing is most, and that very few additional benefits were gained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="132">Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with conventional soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand handling with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-washed alcohol solutions for hands. in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus on hand-washing, and the Klostridium diffusion dispute.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in different health facilities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important means to improve health and even digestion.</seg>
<seg id="136">But the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of washing hands regularly.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Advocating and encouraging hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="140">In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the situation with hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, sanitary and epidemiological supervision at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the hand washing in schools of the United Nations Children's Fund Â« Three Star Approach.</seg>
<seg id="142">By ensuring compliance with minimum standards are met, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Installation of handwashers is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce morbidity and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">The World Handwashing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the pandemic of 2019-20, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use, and of</seg>
<seg id="145">Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (preserved years of life without disability).</seg>
<seg id="146">However, one study suggests that stimulating hand-washing with soap â is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of hand washing for human health â, especially for vulnerable categories of people, an English nurse and such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals Åencia was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria, and Florence Nightingale), the founder of the modern nursing "-.</seg>
<seg id="148">At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasms.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, with outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and health care-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">With the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of how important it is to wash your hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, in Germany, in public toilets,, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports were placed posters with proper hand-washing techniques ".</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "to wash your hands" means manifesting your unwillingness to take responsibility for anything or to be a party to something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate washed his hands when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; the later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's play, Lady Macbeth begins inadvertently wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes an impure conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to.</seg>
<seg id="155">It has also been found that people who recalled or observed any unethical act are more likely to wash their hands compared to other people, and for them, handwashers are more important to them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Also, It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it will participate in any other â cleansing compensating activities such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">In religions hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual envisaged in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand-washing, especially after certain actions.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe mandatory hand washing hands after visiting the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The outbreak ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð°Ð²Ð¸ÑÑÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: at the moment in China and other countries around the world, with more than 3,000 people have died, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000 infections.</seg>
<seg id="2">Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms, using a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much it is far more contagious and affects older people more often than younger ones and men more often than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will take a look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring (Chinese New Year), which in 2020 fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection have been urged to stay at home for the holiday and for many weeks after it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given the high degree of similarity with coronavirus (CoV), which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 named the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country, and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one enemy for society and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months there have been more than 200 publications about COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which the sequence of the virus from a range of patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss known facts about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century we have twice experienced highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with appalling levels of the disease and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the meantime, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, it became known about the infection of health care workers, which suggested the possibility of human transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, quarantine was introduced in Wuhan, and the city's public transport was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus is a global public health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already reached approximately 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).</seg>
<seg id="28">Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, the results of a multi-center clinical study involving 8 866 patients, including 4 021 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, was provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 were exposed to all age groups, but mostly sick people aged 30 to 65 were.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31 / 100,000) than among women (0.27 / 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei province and nearby regions.</seg>
<seg id="34">On average, from the moment of symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis, were 5 (2 â 9) days.</seg>
<seg id="35">The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0 â 7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">From the moment of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8 â 13) days passed.</seg>
<seg id="37">The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 â 4.05), while the adjusted R0 was 2.23 â 4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 â 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 â 4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for in the case of COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (â¥ 60) and severe cases of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of semantic RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, glycoprotein (S) is associated with the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="44">The cytoplasm is released by the viral RNA genome; after replication of the viral genome, the genome RNA, together with the shell glycoproteins and proteins of nucleocapsid, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first reports of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence appeared on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% identical to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">With the help of an electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of the human respiratory epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has been established that the human ACE2 enzyme is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients a disease less severe than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and a secreted protein, encoded orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression of IFN '; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.</seg>
<seg id="53">On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of a full-sized human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Ã in a complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, providing evidence in the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate master</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through palm civets and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two similar to SARS coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it remains unknown what kind species became an intermediate host, which the virus was able to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the path of transmission also remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="60">Mr. Ji and colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans were snakes, in the process of which there was a recombination in the S-protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins Å long-fished mammals, which feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the difference of 1% distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2, for the most part, are still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 Â° C and 40 â 50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating up to 56 Â° C for 30 minutes; effectively block the activity of the virus can ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.</seg>
<seg id="67">The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is currently no data on the detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">As a rule, the virus that gets into the host's body first recognizes the innate immune system by means of image-recognition receptors (ORRs), including lectin-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.</seg>
<seg id="71">Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, thanks to N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4 + and CD8 +, play an important role in protecting the body.</seg>
<seg id="75">T-cells CD4 + stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8 + directly kill the affected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humorous immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from a recovering patient neutralized MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to polyorganic failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with associated pathologies and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">The chance of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A later study, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 â 7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of the quarantine measures imposed, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="87">A common practice to has become a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the quarantine period should be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain in the muscles, headache, sore throat,, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients had shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in chest images.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found the following prevalence of symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, shortness of breath and 3% 55 0% Î£ diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial lung ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results came from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infections.</seg>
<seg id="95">Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than in patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">In patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%), and sore throat (21%).</seg>
<seg id="98">The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99 â 100%), dry cough (29 â 75%), shortness of breath (403,042%), diarrhoea (203,025%) and sore throat (133,025%), and artificial lung ventilation 1420%.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.</seg>
<seg id="100">In comparison, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate at 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) within 5.71 â 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures show a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for infection with a new virus is lower than the last two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster manifestation often occurs when infection occurs within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or caught together on any transport, such as a cruise liner.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with those infected or sick in the last two weeks before the disease.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, a worrying signal to extend according to the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, after being discharged from the hospital, can again become carriers of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="109">At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced amounts of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had been with leukocyte levels &lt; 4 Ã 109 / L, including leukocyte levels &lt; 1 Ã 109 / L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin aminotransferase and viremia.</seg>
<seg id="111">In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sequestration in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe course of the disease, the level of D-dimer, the product of fibrin decay fibrin. present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">In most patients with COVID-19, a chest X-ray examination revealed pathologies characterized by uneven obscurities on both sides or obscurities on the type of matte glass in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).</seg>
<seg id="115">In the development of ARI uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, the worst X-ray results of X-rays often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detachment of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and interwoven lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear synthystic cells in lungs of patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.</seg>
<seg id="119">The main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was used as the method of detection of RNA SARS-CoV-2 through polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).</seg>
<seg id="120">However, given the high level of false negative results, which can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020 in China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).</seg>
<seg id="121">Similar was the situation with SARS diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="122">Thus, for effective diagnosis it is critical and necessary to combine data from medical history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of X-ray examination.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang (10 â 100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment. described the protocol of application of the application of the technique SHERLOCK based on CRISPR repetition for SARS-CoV-2 detection of; this technique allows to detect synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 and 10 â 18 mol / to</seg>
<seg id="124">This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the convenience of their conduct.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in counteracting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are mainly able to provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy, while at the same time trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">It was suggested to use even the plasma of recovered patients.</seg>
<seg id="128">Drug companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs and may also be to a lesser extent affected by other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, disruption of work and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are assigned depending on the severity of the disease, is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified technique of extrapulmonary blood circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">Also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is known to be a cytokine storm is a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="135">The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge number of free radicals, which become the main cause of development of ODS and polyorganic insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="137">In the treatment of cytokine storm, particularly in patients in serious condition, the is essential.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm, based on suppression of immunity, include modulation of immune response aimed at control of T-cells; blockage of production of cytokines IFN-Î³, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus kinase; application of, cytokine signals 4 and inhibitors of.</seg>
<seg id="140">To reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity suppressors of.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids in large dosages are not useful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="144">There is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy at the time of writing, there.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the intravenous introduction of, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, the also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Relying on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China to conduct pair studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition,, interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies production</seg>
<seg id="153">Blood withdrawal from patients cured of contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been applied for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="154">And indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and target them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this premise, was singled out plasma from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, in order to suggest a mass application of this method before the specific therapy is carried out, it is necessary that the untested and unwritten explanations are not made.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies associated with the use of plasma should be carefully examined.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma to treat patients in critical condition requires a lot.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to overcome the global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify the B-cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">So we will be able to move immediately to mass production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">The Chinese millennials have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces of China, where the Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment treat 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7% of patients with COVID-19), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.</seg>
<seg id="172">On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively by Western medicine and combined treatment methods of Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in hospital conditions were was significantly less in patients for which with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in patients treated only by Western methods.</seg>
<seg id="174">The most surprising is that the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in the group that was treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is also of interest to obtain, where possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine, or their combination.</seg>
<seg id="177">Patients with suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly have a strong fear of and even fatal disease, and the people closed to quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric conditions were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="180">Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in those who have contact with them, as well as to all other people who require it.</seg>
<seg id="182">As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal carriers of infection and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to develop long-lived and highly active neutralising antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Animal studies have developed live weakened SARS vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, prior to clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in age patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="187">Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS-virus continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.</seg>
<seg id="189">To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using an inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, there are serious difficulties due to the long (an average of 18 months) period required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="192">Being a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients manage to recover gradually without complications.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.</seg>
<seg id="195">It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on the clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may influence the prediction of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study, 8 866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (an average of 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31 / 100,000 vs. 0.27 / 100,000), as mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.</seg>
<seg id="205">Deviations identified in laboratory studies: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also suggested that the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis at COVID-19, should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferase, alanin-aminotransferase and creatinkinase can also predict the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are distinguished in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors should be taken into take into account the data of chest X-ray examination and the development of clinical symptoms over time.</seg>
<seg id="211">The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.</seg>
<seg id="212">Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19 these drugs should be, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As already described above, against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">In order to relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to the current demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses. causing common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet ended the incubation period can spread the virus on a significant scale, which makes epidemiological control very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, it transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, with most cases not occurring early on.</seg>
<seg id="220">So today's COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is a work in which has declared universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the extended quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced to interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures are extremely damaging to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being identified is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="223">According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of attenuation will last 3 â 4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) with colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nasal smears from the nose and throat taken from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the current strategies may have had an impact.</seg>
<seg id="229">According to initial projections, Ebola was expected to hit up to a million people and cause half a million patients.</seg>
<seg id="230">But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.</seg>
<seg id="231">There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infective capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been detected in kale, which means that an oral faecal mode of transmission is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="235">According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers, who are in contact with patients or infected.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Series 1860s series No.) help to control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks do not allow microcaps of fluid from potentially infected to fly in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions ranging from 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks. folded together, medical professionals directly in contact with patients must wear N95-class masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health workers should wear a figure-fitting protective robe, to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he was wearing a N95 class mask; perhaps the virus got into his body through inflamed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or closed protective glasses.</seg>
<seg id="245">All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave their homes, observing self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be a distance of about a metre.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity in human-to-human transmission and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially during the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan with minimal casualties.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, health authorities should: (1) to make more cautious public statements, because each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than calm the public; and (4) more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly check and response to improve public.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing had spread to 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a recurrence of SARS in the outbreak of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people is also higher than among young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">Deaths as a result of SARS are higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect those around only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">All this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.</seg>
<seg id="264">Against the background of this rapid advance of COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:</seg>
<seg id="265">What is the origin of the virus SARS-CoV-2 virus?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal became an intermediate species, transmitting the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any moment.</seg>
<seg id="269">Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical samples have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly the virus is introduced into the cells of the respiratory tract and triggered subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also linked to producing ACE2 cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it cause a global pandemic, will disappear as SARS or will periodically relapse like influenza?</seg>
<seg id="275">These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life, whatever it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.</seg>
<seg id="3">In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available earlier than 18 months later.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing Phase I safety studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research into its linkage.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technological platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies are:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, and RNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)</seg>
<seg id="13">As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in the planning or development stage), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been declared, but there is little publicly available information on them (presumably,.</seg>
<seg id="14">Phases I-II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites, with simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease at the same time monitoring side effects at optimal dosages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in the pre-clinical studies).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced work on its own vaccine to begin testing on humans in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The start of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.</seg>
<seg id="20">On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of work on was to develop its vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen, together with his biotechnology partner Vaxart is developing an oral vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine on a technology similar to that used to vaccinate against neoantigen cancer.</seg>
<seg id="24">On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the beginning of of testing.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it is launching a project to develop a peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested on humans in 90 days.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">For development and production of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="31">Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On March 12, 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to the development of a vaccine even in an accelerated pace.</seg>
<seg id="33">On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle similar to the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with testing on humans and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a vaccine based on.</seg>
<seg id="37">BNT162 is a candidate for the IRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical testing and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive the results of preclinical testing, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as the fall.</seg>
<seg id="39">On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities of in Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">At about the same time, the Canadian government announced that it will allocate 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a new outbreak of coronavirus vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for a national vaccine bank ÅÃ­, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that "MNA injected subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies in mice that showed up 2 weeks after immunization."</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be to be produced in the form of a nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will reproduce inside human bacteria and form harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the US government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers combined with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they can have other benefits beyond the of disease prevention.</seg>
<seg id="52">Another randomized study, which is being in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Perhaps the vaccines being developed will be unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that would be safe and effective for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine from MERS, which passed Phase I clinical trials on humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the viral vector and were in the in the process of being developed, two were adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).</seg>
<seg id="60">On social media spread conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus COVID-19 is not new at all, and that the vaccine against it already exists.</seg>
<seg id="61">Publications on social media cited the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents for genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as coronavirus SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as the hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2, is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, and its enzymatically active domain enters the surface of lung cells and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extracellular ACE2 domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, the ventral striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, splits the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilatatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH)</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and gravin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the priming of the protein S serine protease carrier TMPRSS2, inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic remedy. This has led some to think that.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE APF and BRA inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors, who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with a general risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">It is assumed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novelty in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused by lipopolisaccharides.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of the exposure in 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising remedy for people with the intolerance to of classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The coronavirus pandemic of is the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome -2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people have recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">China's mortality rate is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04 percent in Algeria to 0.08 percent in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common symptoms include a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth with coughing, keeping distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closure of various facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Disinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet. There have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of the virus spreading.</seg>
<seg id="15">Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation of the situation was launched.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cases of infection have been linked to the Huangan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus with a great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease originated on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, the publication of the South China Morning Post, of which has not been verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, because of the many cases with low symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">By February 26, relatively few cases of infection among young people had been reported, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test proved positive according to official protocols.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of 23 March, no country has been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted an official policy prescribing no testing for only minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The study, published March 16, found that 86 percent of COVID-19 infections were not been detected in China until January 23, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 percent of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to a study, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the figure could be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most patients with COVID-19 safely recover.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to the COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as of February 5, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over the age of 60, and 75 per cent of those killed had concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on deaths from COVID-19 pandemic</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may exclude deceased people who have not been tested for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4 â 5 times.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges, "We know that [the death toll] is lower than the actual Â». His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the United States., such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">All indicators vary depending on the region and time of disease spread; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the the outbreak of the disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health. The.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039 / 1 617 204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Data vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms appeared on January 1, 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms appeared after February 1, 2020). Other the</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not time-bound and reflect indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-based Medicine estimates the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Who argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and exact duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni, an employee a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go off the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease ends, they begin to.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, in the current situation it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen. "</seg>
<seg id="51">The medical adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan, argues that "everything can end by June, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate possibly within a year or two."</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is created, "physical distancing and other measures will be required.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University believes: Â«, an employee of the "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it can turn into a seasonal disease, erupting each year. "</seg>
<seg id="55">The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">Two of the most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, the formation of in the airways (slide), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood clots, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO in with the development of respiratory tract, one in six people.</seg>
<seg id="59">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling depressed in the chest, sudden sensation of confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips.</seg>
<seg id="60">In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing those in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and screening for infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">Chinese scientists estimate the number of cases of asymptomatic current of the disease ranges from a few units to 44 percent of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="62">The normal incubation period (the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, usually five days. As long as there is no clarity on the symptom of a.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about how the disease spread are still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops emitted into the air along with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">According to some studies, with an open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">There is speculation that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops emitted into the air during a conversation, which can stay in the air for longer. Respiratory drops can also be formed during exhalation, including during the conversation, although the virus is not usually carried by air.</seg>
<seg id="67">Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people as well as into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical treatments, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CHR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government denies the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and at later stages of the SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days.</seg>
<seg id="72">There have been cases where tests have been positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms appear, and this suggests the possibility of transmission of the virus before the onset of symptoms manifest.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact-tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.</seg>
<seg id="74">Staff at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2 â 3 other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is capable of living up to three days, on a cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces â up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. The and other animals, a positive result was obtained at COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities are advised to wash their hands after contact with animals, just like that, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could touch infected people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2 â©) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.</seg>
<seg id="82">At the holistic genomic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of the pangolins and human viruses.</seg>
<seg id="84">A holistic genome comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it must eventually be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.</seg>
<seg id="86">The results of the study comparing the methods of PCR tests and CT scans used in Wuhan showed that CT scan is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease currents.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT scans for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the diagnosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, and the first of was published on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is tested for.</seg>
<seg id="90">It can be performed on breathing samples and blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Normally, a nasophageal smear is used for the test, although it can also be used as a zev smear. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of 6 April 2020, none of them had proved accurate enough to win approval for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Characteristic features of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral turbulence by the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural protrusion.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.</seg>
<seg id="98">In China, a major study comparing the results of CT scan of the chest and PCR testing was conducted, and it was found that, although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive and therefore could be considered a screening tool in contaminated areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">In order to diagnose the virus with the help of X-rays and computer tomography, drilling neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing, which should be thrown away immediately after use should be thrown away immediately after use.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may have already become infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance themselves from people. Many Governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has been able to spread to most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading to a population, whose members do not know where and how they have been infected. Medical professionals who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection. Tracking contact is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organisations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations issued have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance of people.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked to develop solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data, such as recording user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.</seg>
<seg id="107">If a mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test proved positive, he receives a notice. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection â for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">At the moment, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on its creation.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when hands are heavily contaminated with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after shrieking, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which reveals its protective shell.</seg>
<seg id="112">In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on an alcohol-based basis with alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="113">The WHO recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with the content of 62 â 71% ethanol, 50 â 100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 â 7.5% povidon iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all spaces of such a facility, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.</seg>
<seg id="117">Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.</seg>
<seg id="118">Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of masks can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.</seg>
<seg id="119">The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, using a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main method of infection. Masks are also recommended for the use of those caring for people who may have been infected. "</seg>
<seg id="121">The WHO recommends that healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask does reduce the number of touches to the face.</seg>
<seg id="122">Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">The CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing tissue facial masks for non-medical purposes. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.</seg>
<seg id="124">In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials are urging people to make facial tissue masks at home and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are banned from going outside without masks covering their noses and mouths.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government has ordered all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="130">On April 1, Taiwan, where ten million medical masks a day have been produced since mid-March, was required to use medical masks on all passengers on trains and intercity buses.</seg>
<seg id="131">In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask while going outside; those residents who cannot buy masks have been advised to sew them on their own at home.</seg>
<seg id="132">Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.</seg>
<seg id="134">Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="135">People can use social distancing measures to by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings and physically distancing themselves from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many regional governments, especially those affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distancing.</seg>
<seg id="137">The maximum number of people that can gather in one place according to 50 people, and later to 10 to the recommendation of U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was not been quickly reduced, starting with 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19),.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 2020 Germany banned from going, more than two people. Older people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system. face an increased risk of contracting the virus in them as long as to stay at home if there has been an outbreak of disease in the. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", thus clarifying the purpose of this measure - reduce physical contact within the social networks, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term Â« social distancing Â» was understood in such a way that people should expose themselves to complete social isolation, instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">Among others, recommendations have been made to engage in sexual intercourse only with your regular partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are recommended self-isolation at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="143">Those in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="144">Those who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19, or recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, were advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.</seg>
<seg id="145">Strategies to control the outbreak include containment, suppression or mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.</seg>
<seg id="147">At a time when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are focused on mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Measures to contain and mitigate the impact of the spread of the disease can be undertaken simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the base number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">Such efforts reduce the risk of congestion of health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with an outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass events; community involvement in China and participation in such measures, and to protect the environment, such as well as the surface cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also adopted a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Singapore, it provided financial support to infected persons in self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.</seg>
<seg id="155">In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. Modelling across the UK and the US has shown that with regard to (slowing, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease could reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2 / 3, and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred method, but it needs to be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it happens sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are would be.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic result in social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">Antiviral drugs approved to treat COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking non-prescription medication from colds, drinking enough fluids and rest can help alleviate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and breathing support.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds that were previously approved to treat other viral diseases are also being considered for use to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The WHO also reported that some traditional and home remedies may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="166">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to assist in the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as increasing intensive care capacity by training staff of resources in the number of at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19, eliminating non-urgent,</seg>
<seg id="167">There are various theories as to where the very first case of infection may have occurred, the so-called "zero patient".</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus infections in Hubei province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Mostly they were mainly linked to the Huangan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at the Hubei province clinic, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, on 27 December, the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity Ð¦Ð·ÑÐ½ÑÐ°Ð½Ñ in Wuhan city.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors from the central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a coronavirus similar to SARS ".</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising panic.</seg>
<seg id="173">Later, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="174">Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main rail hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.</seg>
<seg id="178">About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.</seg>
<seg id="179">Because of the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and imposed border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">The national response included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation) and curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, some 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion people, about a third of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the validity of which was not verified, this date is November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">On December 26, Zhang Jishian's doctor worked with a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity Ð¦Ð·ÑÐ½ÑÐ°Ð½Ñ in Wuhan city on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="185">On December 31, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan issued a public notice.</seg>
<seg id="186">The WHO was notified the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">In connection with such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for spreading rumors about the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="188">Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission argued that there was no clear evidence of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed by the Secretary General of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, "the's war."</seg>
<seg id="190">The events of the largest-scale quarantine in human history began to unfold, with the announcement of a sanitary cordon on 23 January and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan, which later spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.</seg>
<seg id="191">The city banned the use of personal transport.</seg>
<seg id="192">Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.</seg>
<seg id="193">The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary Huoshenshan hospital, which was completed in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Another hospital,, which was later built to accommodate other incoming patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration period.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and schools were closed across the country.</seg>
<seg id="197">Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular, with regard to schools and universities.</seg>
<seg id="198">In several regions of China, authorities have imposed a remote mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions have been imposed in and outside Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="200">The timetable for public transport has been changed and museums across China have been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">Since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the of the virus from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, Beijing introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, mainland China had only one case of internal transmission, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted diseases was largely halted and the outbreak in China was brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Wuhan, were lifted, it happened two months after the closure of the province to quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.</seg>
<seg id="206">On March 30, the Chinese government called on the enterprises and factories to resume work and provided the companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4 at 10: 00 a national three-minute silence took place, which opened a day of of</seg>
<seg id="207">It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.</seg>
<seg id="208">On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji in.</seg>
<seg id="209">Shinchongji's followers came to in Taegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, of the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="211">On February 28, there were more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection in Korea, rising to 3,150 already on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were confirmed to have the virus, according to analyses.</seg>
<seg id="213">The outbreak has affected the number of travel, hence the airline flight schedule has been changed. South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track the contacts and arrange quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms via a mobile app to all those who came from abroad, a-on testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as increased testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.</seg>
<seg id="215">South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there. Initially, South Korean society is divided.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the government's inadequate response to the outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="217">On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day for four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports, on April 1 in South Korea requested for help in testing for the virus 121 countries.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.</seg>
<seg id="221">The first measures imposed by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, universities and schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government had not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="224">Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but intense movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.</seg>
<seg id="225">Shia shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.</seg>
<seg id="226">Amid claims of a cover-up the extent of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases of the disease with Iran, which indicates that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, tested positive for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners suitable for this category.</seg>
<seg id="229">The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.</seg>
<seg id="231">By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been reported every hour in Iran, and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.</seg>
<seg id="234">It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="235">The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had hit Italy when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 made in Rome, a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of infections has grown rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">Later, an unassociated cluster of COVID-19 infections was discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="239">Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.</seg>
<seg id="240">In these areas have already been ordered to suspend operations and cancel sports events. On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as in Italy at that time had already been recorded the 100 hryvnia.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were due to take place behind closed doors until April, but all sporting events were postponed for at least one month on March 9.</seg>
<seg id="242">On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of,, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for prioritizing patient care that may have to be used.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy overtook China for the death rate from coronavirus, ranked first in the world, after the announcement of 3,405 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, with the majority concentrated in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">One CNN report noted that such a high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to survey all those who are currently ill with coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="247">The United Kingdom responded to the virus most calmly from all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not commit citizens to any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.</seg>
<seg id="248">As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously enough to that it is possible to the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending refraining from all travel and social contacts of paramount importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.</seg>
<seg id="249">On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but no more than Pound2,500 a month as a measure to support the public during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to cases of extreme need.</seg>

<seg id="1">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Proper workplace risk management depends on the location and work task, is based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that posts said lower-risk levels have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases require basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home with signs of the disease, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, a high-density working environment and some large retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers that medical personnel and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk, with the risk is increased to very high when such personnel perform aerosol-related procedures, leading to the formation or the collection / processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of security engineering equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment, suitable for the task.</seg>
<seg id="10">The outbreak COVID-19 can have a variety of in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commercial templates may vary with respect to both the types of goods for which there is in demand and the in which such goods are purchased (e.g., making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to organize protection.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in the community, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also outline the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may result from the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to the recommendations of the national or state level.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of the targets for responding to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.</seg>
<seg id="18">The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="20">If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of disease COVID-19 most effective engineering safety equipment, then â administrative measures and, finally, â means of personal protection.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering security means isolate employees from workplace risk locations and do not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal protective equipment should be chosen according to the threat to the employee, the fit in size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, as well as properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Industrial Health Administration (OSHA) says posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including closing their mouths with coughs and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, availability of remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The rapid identification and isolation of people who could potentially be infected with Î£ is a critical step for the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the heat stops, the lack of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-relieving drugs or other medications that eliminate symptoms, and also prescribes that policies on sick leave be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensure employees are aware of such policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with the because of such a person's recent travel to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="30">In such groups and groups with a high-efficiency air filters, the categories include employees who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, working environment with a high population density and some large retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="31">In rare cases, workers at such a risk may need to wear respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">If a person falls ill on a plane, the proper safety of employees and other passengers requires measures such as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for the sick person, the sick person with a mask or asking him to cover the nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Secondary crew members must wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller, when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical centre on the ship if there is heat or other symptoms of someone on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be introduced, such as cancelling visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, adjusting the time of arrival and care, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">At a significant rate of in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term on can be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as those prescribed to ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">When close contact during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse belts with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping out, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and to dispose of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes that some categories of health care workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk positions include medical, support, laboratory and medical transport staff contacting patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="42">They have a very high risk of infection in their procedures, leading to the formation of aerosol, or when collecting / processing samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or the collection invasive methods.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk morgue workers include employees who handle the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they perform an autopsy, they are classified as very high-risk. Additional safety engineering tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including in aerosol procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautionary measures for biological safety level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients in different waiting areas, depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients with confirmed or suspected infection SARS-CoV-2, as well as the, accompanied by aerosol formation.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the U.S., NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with an N95 or higher filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 â is a disease transmitted by the respiratory rather than through physiological fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The WHO recommends using only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the point of patients.</seg>
<seg id="51">Those who collect samples from the respiratory tract in patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, robe and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">For procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of the surgical mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the lack of access to patients infected with COVID-19, only those who provide immediate care, of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment through the use of the use of only those personal protective equipment necessary for a specific task, the prolonged use of the same respirator without, when dealing with multiple patients with the same diagnoses, and the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not to use masks for those without symptoms. remote medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows,,</seg>

<seg id="18">The symptoms of upper respiratory tract diseases, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat, may be less common.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are also gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, in different percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some cases reported in China, were initially manifested only a by the sensation of tightness in the chest and increased heartbeat.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease can progress developing into pneumonia, polyorganic failure, and eventually death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to the available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20 percent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations about the virus, the duration of the disease was asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="27">China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily report from April 1; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Both wet and saliva can have a large concentration of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in the normal volume.</seg>
<seg id="30">The study, conducted in Singapore, showed that with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of particles of the virus through Ð±Ð¸Ð¾Ð°ÑÑÐ¾Ð·Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÐ¼ still is possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside rooms showed the presence of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical treatments, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CHR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore the spread of the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also fears that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible and prior to the onset of symptoms, but the risk is small.</seg>
<seg id="34">Staff at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2 â 3 other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus can live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces â up to 4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and detergents, when used properly, have a rather useful effect in combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can eliminate it from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus. In the study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after.</seg>
<seg id="39">In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2 â©) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory illnesses registered in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in native coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="42">Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which exposes its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The â is the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates host cells through angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus connects to ACE2 and enters the host cell with the help of the characteristic surface glycoprotein Î£ Ï (peplomer). is a</seg>
<seg id="45">Twelve per cent 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe form of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, as they participate in the work of this body.</seg>
<seg id="48">The high frequency of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in OIT with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis., showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).</seg>
<seg id="49">Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe course of COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that emit IL-6, and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the autopsy, lymphocytic infiltrations were also detected.</seg>
<seg id="52">The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.</seg>
<seg id="54">The test is usually carried out on respirator samples obtained by a nasophageal smear from the nasopharynx, but a sample of nasal or sputum smear can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is also possible to take blood samples, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to highlight the strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at this point in time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development but have not yet been widely disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60 â 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnosis test, giving permission for its use at the end of this month. The guidelines</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral multipartite subpleural sealing focuses on the type of frosted glass Â« Â» with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone bridge (Ð´Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ðµ septal thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">On the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 there is little data.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs</seg>
<seg id="66">Four types of viral pneumonia severity of can be observed.</seg>
<seg id="67">Light form of pneumonia: pulmonary swelling, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-nuclear giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Healing pneumonia: The organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffuse intravascular folding (DVS-syndrome); leukoeritroblastic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, adherence to the rules of respiratory hygiene, as well as avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="74">After coughing or sneezing it is recommended to carry out a quality hygienic procedure for the hands.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular, in order to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic course of disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people;. of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed and the movement of citizens and major public events have been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="76">The distance recommendations for distancing also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no confirmed efficacy drugs against COVID-19. Since the completion of the vaccine is not expected until the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the.</seg>
<seg id="78">The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after shrieking, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol-containing (alcohol content is not less than 60%) to for hand processing, but only when soap and water are not available. WHO provides two recipes for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a moisturiser.</seg>
<seg id="83">Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that those who suspect being infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">In the U.S., intensive care physicians and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource â IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">To treat the symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend opting for paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care settings, when performing procedures in which airdrops can occur, such as intubation or hand drying.</seg>
<seg id="92">The CDC recommends that medical professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the be placed in an air-drop facility (AIIR) - an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions in terms of.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended personal protective equipment:, the protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of these is preferable to use medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Application Permit (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used uninstructed, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="96">If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, as a last resort, making masks on their own at home.</seg>
<seg id="97">In most cases, the current COVID-19 forms are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive pressure in the airways.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition is as effective as IWL.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if it is available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to nasal cannula with an intense air flow. The risk of a severe form of the disease for older people (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) are much higher.</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the surge in cases of COVID-19 infection in a severe form requiring hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to the results of a study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 percent needed mechanical support for lung ventilation and 1.4 percent died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, approximately 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="104">The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developing at COVID-19 and oxygenation cause more problems.</seg>
<seg id="105">Inhalation pressure-supported IWLs and are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure a minimum of damage to them by ventilation, which may develop pneumothorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">On earlier fan models, high PACs may not be available.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">The most promising appears to be the.</seg>
<seg id="109">The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the latter stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="111">The WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in testing the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary permission for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases when a serious or immediate danger.</seg>
<seg id="112">Its use has not been subject to clinical studies, which should be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">To login, users must enter their name and identification number to in.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect ÅÃ­ÄÃ­ close contact with the help of surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notice to local health authorities. Big data collected from mobile phones. facial recognition technology. mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea. Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="119">Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for people who may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided federal government agencies in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced in order to identify quarantine violators.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that mobile network operators report that "40% of people still continue to move around the territory."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government has a a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with over 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kersti Kaljulayd also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or because of fear of infection itself.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline Î£ ideal conditions for harming the mental health and people well-being."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or no symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover normally within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may can take three to six weeks to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="129">Pregnant women may be at higher risk of a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. COVID-19 lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.</seg>
<seg id="130">In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as and heart, kidney and liver problems.</seg>
<seg id="132">Abnormalities of thrombosis, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while kidney function impairment was observed in 4% of this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20 â 30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive care unit was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to early case studies, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study conducted by the National Commission of Health of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent, and among women 1.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological studies of posthumous lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">In pneumocytes viral cytopatic changes were observed.</seg>
<seg id="140">The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8 percent of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were about raising troponin levels or cardiac arrest the heart.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Assessments vary depending on the condition of the mortality by due to such regional differences, as well as because of the methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">Insufficiently effective counting of cases in light form can lead to an overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were 1.4 times more likely to develop, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong clinic, found that in some patients recovered from the disease, lung volume decreased by 20 â 30% and their scans revealed damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">After recovery it can also lead to a syndrome of intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus developed persistent immunity against it.</seg>
<seg id="150">Judging by the flow of other coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but it has also been reported that after recovery from COVID-19, tests for coronavirus were still positive.</seg>
<seg id="151">In these cases, it is believed that there has been an aggravated prolonged course of the disease, rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is thought to be natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from humans to humans.</seg>
<seg id="154">The study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="155">According to official figures released by the WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">All figures vary depending on the region and time of the spread of the disease, they are also affected by the volume of testing, quality of health systems, used regimens, the time since the start of the outbreak of the disease and population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency codes: ICD-10: U07.1 "for deaths from laboratory-confirmed infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2" for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths divided by the number of cases of is the number of deaths and for a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822 / 2 240 191).</seg>
<seg id="160">This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the mortality rate as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) died as a result of the disease. the rate of mortality as a result of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of patients died as a result of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the, and</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not time-specific and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection prior to the completion of the course of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="162">Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have had the infection, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected by the presence of such antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="163">At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.</seg>
<seg id="164">In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.</seg>
<seg id="165">Moreover, Germany's health-care system has not been overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="166">In the Netherlands, about 3 percent of the population may have antibodies, judging by the according to blood donation figures.</seg>
<seg id="167">COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the death rates are higher in men.</seg>
<seg id="170">The group most at risk is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57 percent of those infected were men, and 72 percent of deaths from COVID-19 were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="176">Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.</seg>
<seg id="177">The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, who are more likely to become infected.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019. WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explains: (disease), and a year when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019 </seg>
<seg id="180">This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms COVID-19 and Åivirus responsible for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Uhanka coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms Åost acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov "and" 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, the official names of COVID-19 "and" SARS-CoV-2 were published.</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some manufacturers of digital services print medical materials, such as nasal smear tampons, as well as parts of IWL machines.</seg>
<seg id="187">In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, while one of the local plant was reassigned and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the first outbreak of COVID-19, on the Internet began to spread rapidly with high speed various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects have.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans are likely to infect other animals with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">For now, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.</seg>
<seg id="192">Various international studies of on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (Â« Â»), which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous SARS-CoV studies are used in scientific developments.</seg>
<seg id="196">There are three vaccination strategies.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, aims to trigger the human body's rapid immune response to a new infection of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-protein, which helps the virus to penetrate the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all of the country's stores, to two and one packaging respectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-pack restriction.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions were reported in ads on the box office, as well as the network Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">Citizens have reportedly started to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to a regime of general self-isolation.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited that number to 4 packages.</seg>
<seg id="8">The network AL Coles said in a March 8 press release that with the introduction of a four-package restriction, "in many stores, toilet paper is still being sold too quickly by the one delivery within an hour, and called such demand unprecedented Â« Â», while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called such a trend" unexpected ".</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the Woolworths last week there has been a sharp rise in sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that number to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To fill the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to replenish stocks, but this that was hampered by local authorities' restrictions on truck timetables.</seg>
<seg id="13">It expects a rise in the cost of products as suppliers try to meet the demand, but there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not hold shares on Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report to news.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, told the paper that stores replenish stocks every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the number of is small, and after the sale of the entire volume goods, long rows of shelves remained empty, reinforcing the sense of shortage of stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants for hands could be placed on these shelves in large numbers, buyers probably wouldn't panic," says Russell Zimmerman.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last Wednesday, the maker of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper manufacturer Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent-branded goods, said they were working around the clock to ensure there were a number of products.</seg>
<seg id="20">Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during the on Labor Day week, some real estate sellers began offering the first bidders free toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to cut and use as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to ABC Australia's March 3 report by, at first stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, saying they did not plan to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, hand washing hands and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday night it was observed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.</seg>

<seg id="4">DATA / TIME REPORT: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">CC0: There are no protected rights</seg>
<seg id="6">This month we live in unusual circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship between people around the world and our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">We observed friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in e-mails, calls and chats â remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.</seg>
<seg id="10">I speak with great gratitude and pride about speak of you as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the work of payment by our colleagues or protecting the safety of communities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="15">At such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the way we work together, starting in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjusting the order of our work and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As previously stated by Robin, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the communication we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to step back, let it be so.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:</seg>
<seg id="23">According to our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders.</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not announce days off: if you can normally work for more hours, it is permitted for the purposes of our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether it to take care of your family, buy food or go to a doctor's appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not monitor your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are sick, you should not work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is not necessary to issue a sick leave or a sick leave: simply inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian from the T &amp; C Ops unit so that T &amp; C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).</seg>
<seg id="31">Hourly rates will be paid in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of pay.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each person will receive payment according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">This in particular implies periods of illness when you cannot work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, it's about self-help.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some of the work is considered essential.</seg>
<seg id="41">We should always support such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">The slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to work "two more to catch up for the" after the pandemic ends.</seg>
<seg id="47">You won't do not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.</seg>
<seg id="48">We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines, where possible.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens to APP (annual plans)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations on the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.</seg>
<seg id="51">We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to give priority to prioritise critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, and with a reduced timetable for the next few weeks for anyone who need or wants to work.</seg>
<seg id="52">This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, provide representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank you to the APP team for their leadership role in such work.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, risks and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, in addition to a host of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="59">The building applies its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is located in the network of WeWork, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19-related rules.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to a remote work, in accordance with the instructions from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the issue of rental space in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Such discussions are ongoing but can be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is recommended that meetings be limited to one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a multi-day course.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send the materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.</seg>
<seg id="71">For ease of reference, appoint a focal point â a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or joint inspection).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need to use a convenient headset, contact the technical support service by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="73">Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Connect to the remoties channel in to talk to colleagues about distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as â editathons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changing such targets.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the coming week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.</seg>
<seg id="79">The general mood in the global community is not only saddened by the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief in connection to mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.</seg>
<seg id="80">As for prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and communication.</seg>
<seg id="81">We remain in touch on COVID-19 issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting, which will be held next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.</seg>
<seg id="83">This time we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together connecting with each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are together in this situation and are ready to help all that we can.</seg>
<seg id="85">In this case, you can still receive information from such e-mails and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, problems with information coverage or if you need other help, please contact CRT.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.</seg>
<seg id="90">If there are privacy concerns, please contact Brian Judan, HR International Global Operations Director of.</seg>
<seg id="91">No such change should be seen as abandoning our work and our commitments.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary service.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.</seg>
<seg id="95">Today is the time to support each other and to create space for the important work ahead in future weeks and perhaps months.</seg>
<seg id="96">For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with maximum impact as soon as the need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">And now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).</seg>

<seg id="1">It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases of ÅÃ­Å¾ COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our group published a short reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronary infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about our experience and provides validated recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "cases of suspected illness" and "confirmed cases" according to the document "Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19" (the seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">This publication has attracted huge attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually based on the basis of current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic and therapeutic strategy practice also continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, in the period from January 16 to March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document "Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19", published by the National Health Committee of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), were published, and the content of some of its provisions substantially changed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recently, in the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors provided comments on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on the pandemic that has engulfed the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to the latest issue of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 Â» (the trial seventh version) and on the results of current research, and their work needs to be updated.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), it is necessary to combine one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspected disease:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in Wuhan and its surroundings or in other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed disease, or from other localities where there have been reported cases of COVID-19 in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with a high temperature</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leucocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome sequencing of the virus shows a high homogeneity relative to new coronaviruses; (3) positive results for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody IgG, or an increase in the titrate at least 4 times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues of the document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) releases, and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the results of the continuous work of researchers searching for the optimal set for detection of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for the confirmation of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms are classified as a low-risk group.</seg>
<seg id="24">The evaluation system also requires refinement in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">With regard to the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is possible if countries are engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, monitoring of cases of the disease, as well as mobilization of their citizens ", - the Director-General of WHO Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus.</seg>
<seg id="6">We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction. "</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented Â« Â»."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that no other respiratory virus other than influenza had not yet been tracked since its inception until the its inception to continuous global spread. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have also never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled. "</seg>
<seg id="11">First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then gave it a new status, the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it will be worse."</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Associated Press on Thursday in the world there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19, more than 4,600 people have died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific and is intended only for designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have undergone the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat them in the hospital, or were absent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact death rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Using a polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on samples from the respiratory tract obtained in a variety of ways, including a nasophageal smear or a sputum sample.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are usually available within a period of several hours to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The OT-PCR test, performed on smears taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing nonetheless to reproduce in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, the material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken as an alternative, using a suction catheter, or it is possible to use the products of (mokrote).</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the early PCR tests was developed at the CharitÃ© Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets of which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">He identifies the E gene Î£EÎ£ Panel, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and gene RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to obtain permission from the National Drug Administration of China on the basis of Cors 2</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency authorization to use.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics has started testing for COVID-19 nationwide from March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions have been declared; fencing and processing analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR Â« Â».</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott's laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020 Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA also approved a test that uses amplification technology of isothermal nucleic acids instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative results in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Currently, Taiwan is developing a test, which spice</seg>
<seg id="32">In a review of the specialized literature for March 2020, it is concluded that "the breast X-rays have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of a CT scan [computer tomography" may have such value even before symptoms appear. "</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical traits identified during CT include bilateral multi-part sub-pleural sealing focal points of Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾Ð´Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÐµ ÑÑÐ±Ð¿Ð»ÐµÐ²ÑÐ°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÐµ tricks seals on the type of frosted glass Â« Â» with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cobblestone bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">The results of the study that compared the methods of PCR tests and CT scans used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic, showed that a CT scan is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in COVID-19 diagnostics. As of March 2020 for the."</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after day 7 of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct population control.</seg>
<seg id="39">In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the production speed of each such system.</seg>
<seg id="40">One peripheral blood sample is usually used in CLT usually uses one, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="41">In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike PCR methods, the stage of the is not required to. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency authorization test kits. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and.</seg>
<seg id="44">Testing performance is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had acquired produced satisfactory results.</seg>
<seg id="46">In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "emergency department staff pass a sample test tube to the patient for", the patient spit into it, give back and receive test results after a while.</seg>
<seg id="47">The tests helped South Korea to organize one of the most and testing procedures than in any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they could do just 10,700 tests a week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's total performance of testing is 160,000 tests a week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, it was a rapid testing has been proposed in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="52">The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12 / 2020 at SARS-CoV-2, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken, up to a week 12 / 2020, inclusive, and 33 491 on 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers the combined sample showed a positive result was the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the in the case of</seg>
<seg id="53">The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been higher, and therefore quarantine costs would have also been twice as high 47 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="54">After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays were released that can test up to 1,122 tests on COVID19 using only 93. Such balanced designs can work in small the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US had become problematic due to a shortage and insufficient number of reagents.</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result, some authors turned to the protocols of processing test sample, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 Â° C (208 Â° F) for 5 minutes with the aim of releasing the genomes of RNA for further testing that would be ballooned 31, it.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was due to the possibility of to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (established on the basis of their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">In 14 days, the is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Different testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus'genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German version was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the United States Health and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits Epidemiology Centers was unavailable until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">But in South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">For several years, the South Korean government has worked to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the development of testing programs as the best way to slow down the spread of the pandemic COVID-19. As a result of the demand for testing, which arose because of the rapid spread of the virus, many people have been infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">The U.S. test kits developed by the CDC, had "shortcomings", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hampered private development tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be failed sampling or improper use of sets.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said it would withdraw the kits that give inaccurate results, and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China, were given wrong results.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovic proposed to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of, claimed that the test kits purchased in China, had a high level of errors "in early April 2020 and the Ministry did not use them".</seg>
<seg id="71">Quarantine measures for those whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as surveillance of the people with whom such patients had positive results.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaucluse, where for the first time in Italy man died from COVID-19, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">Entry into the locality was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="75">With intense tracking of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much less intense than in other developed countries, and there has not had to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on March 23 opened as scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="78">The statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following graph, the indicators of the "column Î£% positive results depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, all other things being equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rapidly growing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU European Union / European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei province was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 develop the disease occurs in a mild form, i.e. in the form of respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority recovering.</seg>
<seg id="8">In approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.</seg>
<seg id="9">The death rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">This study analyses trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for which the WHO determines the presence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three cases returned from Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been detected in all 30 EU / EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections recorded between December 31, 2019 and the date, and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, were in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily at 8: 00 a.m. updates data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in every country in the world, obtained from official sources such as the Ministries of Health in these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indicator of the prevalence rate of active cases of COVID-19, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 for 14 days, was calculated taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8: 00 on 15 March 2020, compared to the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in the development of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">Trends in truncated cumulative COVID-19 incidence over a 14-day period in the EU / EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were broadly in line with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei Province of China (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase around February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of the disease in Italy, but also in all the other EU / EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and in the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8.00 on 15 March in 15 other EU / EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including "catch-up" testing.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions have already filled as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the moment, data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and / or intensive care units in the EU / EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data provided).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, there is a need for systematic collection of such data in order to carry out to supplement current monitoring data, which is the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to a study conducted in 2010 â 2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment for COVID-19 presents scenarios for the loading of health system resources with estimates of hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since at the moment cases are grouped by level of the Territorial Unit Nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2). certain regions of the EU / EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on cases of infection in intensive care units is recommended to be provided, as far as possible, and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="39">The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients with in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care unit, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, the projected rapid increase in of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance. curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2 has an operational, proactive and integrated approach with the subsequent transition from containment to to minimization, because of the number, if such measures are not taken in advance.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Countries have only a short period of time during which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">If this is not done, then in the coming days or weeks of the health care system in other EU / EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zoonic origin of human coronavrus</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild disease such as a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again drew attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV virus related virus.</seg>
<seg id="6">Coronary human infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">The intermediate storage tanks of some human coronavirus are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study of the interaction of animals that are carriers of coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and modes of interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the conditions necessary for successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome, containing between 26 and 32 thousand nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which resembles a crown when examined under an electronic microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including studded protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">In other lines of coronaviruses have also encoded a number of linear specific accesory proteins.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the basis of differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacoronaviruses), with the species of betacoronaviruses comprising the majority of human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronaviruses are bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved to dangerous human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.</seg>
<seg id="26">These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form, such as colds and (or) diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and showing extra pulmonary symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of rhinoceros-separated from patients who fell ill with a cold in the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people and the overall death rate was approximately 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Discovered in 2019 a new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the caused by the current epidemic of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which as of of the March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven human coronaviruses have zoonotic origins, their sources are bats, mice or pets.</seg>
<seg id="38">Numerous data sets show in favor of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has thrown China and the world a stark challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.</seg>
<seg id="40">The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">Perhaps it will also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and Ð°Ð¼Ð¿Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ¸ÑÐ¸ÑÑÑÑÐµÐ³Ð¾ SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease spreading again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">This review provides general information on zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic character after interspecies transmission to the new carrier.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of rhinoceros-separated patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="49">Table 1 informatively and visually presents a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus was later adapted to reproduce in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high temperature and cough observed in in 10-20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of the succulent mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">Clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus are similar to those of the HCoV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as type A influenza and.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and are typically transmitted during winter at moderate latitudes.</seg>
<seg id="55">, The incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild form cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few patients with reduced immunity had severe lower respiratory tract infection.</seg>
<seg id="58">The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemic, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the cause of the disease was SARS-CoV, the third of the identified human coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">Excluding superactive spreaders, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load was 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="63">The common deviations of laboratory indicators from the norm in SARS are lymphopia, irregularities in liver samples and elevated creatinkinase levels.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20 â 30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="66">In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs may also be infected, including the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open biopsy of the lung relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, huge efforts have been made to research human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="69">In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was assigned to a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that to be mainly affects young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">The virus has been detected in the Netherlands, but it is in fact widespread.</seg>
<seg id="74">HCoV-NL63 is estimated that to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, with the peak of the disease occurring at the beginning of early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also referred to as croup.</seg>
<seg id="76">HCoV-HKU1 was singled out in Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to non-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with increased asthmatic disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory disease, has been detected worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="79">All of these four human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation causing highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in the human body.</seg>
<seg id="81">Coronavirus Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first singled out in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Most laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been reported cases of and spread through sporadic secondary infections in close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) for both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses transmitted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered to be one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">Between mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, China's Hubei province, which now, looking back, is linked to an infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization has declared that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed "Coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="90">As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="91">It should be noted that the mortality rate in China's Hubei province is 4.2 per cent and outside Hubei Province it is 1.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by a rise in the temperature of fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also have diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to move rapidly transition into acute respiratory failure syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">There have been reported cases of asymptomatic infection SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="98">The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly observed in human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission plan also notes interesting patterns, characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections and for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in kale samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have yet to answer the question of whether the faecal-oral transmission path of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, a characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passing through humans.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections with symptoms of mild form, have adapted well to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">On the other hand, perhaps that it is humans who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.</seg>
<seg id="114">Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people who have human coronavirus cause severe diseases, simply did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract carrier restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common cold in people with healthy immunity.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require a reserve animal.</seg>
<seg id="120">The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to persist and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of exposure to susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.</seg>
<seg id="122">The SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four non-hospital HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least at present.</seg>
<seg id="124">But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, augmentative and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="127">The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level of.</seg>
<seg id="128">The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the storage medium constantly carries the HCoV for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV was only encased in an intermediate carrier right before or about the time it was encased in humans, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate medium can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying medium, allowing the virus to be replicated lightningly and then transmitted to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can tolerate a dead-end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate medium.</seg>
<seg id="134">By contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="136">Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero patient SARS had contact with hunting and fishing animals in the anamnese (dich). </seg>
<seg id="137">Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus is higher in animal traffickers compared to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in the markets of live animals were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that SARS cases were no longer reported after the destruction of all civets in the markets.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not defined, which leads to the conclusion that the Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifier, rather than a natural reservoir SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">Notably, since 80 per cent of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that multiple small mammal species can also serve as intermediate amplifiers.</seg>
<seg id="142">They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="143">A follow-up search of the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV of bats, called the coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese undercarriage bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other coronaviruses of bats have 88 â 92 per cent the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV at 88Îµ92%.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the foundations of a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">The bats have also been detected in several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV), but none of them, except one, which is WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</seg>
<seg id="149">It has been shown that WIV1, derived from a sample of faeces of bats, uses ACE2 bats, civets and human as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Curiously, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">Today, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an immediate parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">The phylogenetic analysis attributes MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats, and CoV-HKU5 bats.</seg>
<seg id="154">CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.</seg>
<seg id="155">The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, wild bats have not found live MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="157">The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats coincides with only 87%.</seg>
<seg id="158">That is, bats might not be a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-mouthed camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal smears of single-mouthed camels, further confirming the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoir carriers.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that the camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, there were minor symptoms, but massive virality.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels singled out the virus not only respiratory, but also in a fecal-oral way, which is also the main way to release the virus in bats.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have no contact with camels prior to symptoms and are plausible for human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology of 96.2% coincides with the CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from the Asian podkonosovos Rhinolophus affinis.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV., the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute to them parental relationships.</seg>
<seg id="166">That is, bats could not be an immediate reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found in the future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been linked to many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of transmission from the animal to humans.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">The homology of nucleotide sequences of nucleotides of these new genomes is 85 â 92% similar to the coronavirus at the SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.</seg>
<seg id="171">They are clustered into two sublines of differentiation of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of sequences of 97.4%.</seg>
<seg id="172">On the contrary, RSD strains SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of homology sequences throughout the genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the detection of viral contiguities in lung samples that appeared similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">In this study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a sequence of genomes comprising about 86.3 percent of the full-size viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">It cannot be ruled out that pangolin became one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="179">While the highest sequence homology of sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 had the highest sequence homology of sequences within the entire genome.</seg>
<seg id="180">Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between the pangolin betacoronaviruses of pangolins. related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.</seg>
<seg id="181">The opposing proposal favors recombination between the pangolin betacoronavirus, a related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="182">As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may occur from bat coronaviruses of bats, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">It has been reported that the coronavirus of bats, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American tricolor sucrose, exhibits a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could be have been a camel.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">The phylogenetic analysis gave evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission events in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="190">When the interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and people became infected with pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of the interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Alphacoronaviruses of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between them is an alphacoronavirus alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="194">Some data supports the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, the alpha-coronaviruses of bats, related to HCoV-229E, in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alphacoronavirus alpaca has caused a respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alphacoronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thus, one cannot rule out the possibility that alpaca received alphacoronavirus, a related to HCoV-229E, from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">So it's no surprise that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while the alpha-coronaviruses of bats could serve as a gene pool of the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single-mouthed camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-arm camels and from single camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and has since been confirmed by subsequent studies.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats â  ideal proliferators. "</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-horned camels decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="208">He adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.</seg>
<seg id="209">In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild illness and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">His episodic transmission to a man is an accident, and the man remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, betacoronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, several possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or excluded.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans can share an ecological niche with bats thanks to coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying media into which a related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.</seg>
<seg id="218">People are infected with the virus through carcass cutting and eating wildlife meat of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="219">It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">A survey of pets and wildlife on the antibodies is justified.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for the animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to cross-species barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other viruses with single-chain RNA, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be Î£ moderately high "with an average frequency of approximately 10 â 4 replacements per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of the coronavirus adaptation to the new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is interesting that Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-against SARS-CoV-2, which need to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Supposedly this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">The SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-arm camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, a large RNA genome of the in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution favourable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.</seg>
<seg id="236">This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 â² â² end of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, thanks to the unique mechanism of matrix selection, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during replication of RNA.</seg>
<seg id="238">During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the medium, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often switching threads are switched.</seg>
<seg id="239">High-mological full-size and sub-genomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.</seg>
<seg id="241">Interaction of virus-carrier in relation to transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the receptor.</seg>
<seg id="243">In this article presents SARS-CoV recombination is given as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on comparative analysis between strains of SARS-CoV in humans and civets, SARS-CoV is considered to undergo rapid adaptation in different media, especially with respect to mutations on the protein S.</seg>
<seg id="245">In general, the RSD of the protein S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the response of the antibodies carrier intensively selects it.</seg>
<seg id="246">RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318th to 510th, on a fragment of the S1, which binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) of a person, as well as its corceptors.</seg>
<seg id="247">The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize receptors of APF2 of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and ÐµÐ½Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ð´Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ dogs, making possible interspecies transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD, which are different from human viral strains and civets, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">The SARS-CoV civets have mutations K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the studded protein with the human receptor APF2.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S causes the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 to change.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this link is 10-20 times higher than that between human APF2 and S protein SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors were required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but with a different to another segment of the protein S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and carrier restriction.</seg>
<seg id="259">The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers HCoVs, such as bats, single-mouthed camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">For successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and submit to the factors of the of carriers.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Good results can be achieved by unbiased full-genome screening of dependency factors and media retrieval for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of new HCoV: back to zero</seg>
<seg id="264">The variety of coronaviruses of bats creates great opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also drivers driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in the process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new proteins coding genes has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="268">In the case of SARS-CoV accesor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV-have been isolated, but have been found to encode the divergent ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">A 29-nucleotide fission characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found in the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic,.</seg>
<seg id="270">This division splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombination localizations have also been defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in the in one-horned camels in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in its non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is more likely to occur as a result of ridding the virus from the selective pressures, such as from the carrier's immune system of the carrier of the.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to the two-nucleotide fission.</seg>
<seg id="277">While the intact open frame ORF4 reading can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus shows a single-nucleotide insertion that causes the frame to shift.</seg>
<seg id="278">Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.</seg>
<seg id="279">Infection of bats with by coronaviruses recorded weak symptoms or lack thereof, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.</seg>
<seg id="280">It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed thanks to the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main complex of histocompatibility I class.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, the high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while at the same time affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which are highly pathogenic when entering the new carrier.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="285">So it is no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the past twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers the immune response does not involve replication of the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.</seg>
<seg id="293">So, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a favorable effect.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammation has been disrupted in bats.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.</seg>
<seg id="297">While betacoronavirus of bats has been found, nucleotide homology of which coincides with SARS-CoV by 95% similar to, there is also a coronavirus, nucleotide homology of which coincides with the SARS-CoV-2 by 96% similar to.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although it was found that civets and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate media for SARS-CoV-2 have been installed.</seg>
<seg id="299">Pangolin betacoronaviruses have been detected, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins could serve as an intermediate carriers, or that fragments of pangolin betacoronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.</seg>
<seg id="301">Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reserve animals in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and were transferred to humans through intermediate carriers.</seg>
<seg id="304">If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in the markets, shutting down the game markets and destroying civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection, in the light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a challenge for future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-mouthed camels.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels serve as an important means of transport, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are common in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">It is therefore impossible to donate all the camels for MERS control, as has been done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating around the world.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses, which are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">To reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="317">After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan is needed.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural reservoirs until it is possible to capture new territories.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although many of the properties of bats are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="321">To better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.</seg>
<seg id="322">In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">The SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle still lacks some fragments.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if the bats have transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a bat, pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in its natural carriers.</seg>
<seg id="329">Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
