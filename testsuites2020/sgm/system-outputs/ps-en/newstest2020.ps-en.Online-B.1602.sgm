<seg id="1">b'COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 Corona virus disease, for example, the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who Probably in contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some areas and powers various applications were created or proposed with the official support of governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many frameworks have been created to create a contact tracking application.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems designed to track the geographic location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">A few annoying alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to allow users to get closer to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support these Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to see if they have been in contact with people who have Kovid-19 disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.</seg>
<seg id="9">The application was created by the local IT community, which has been released as an open source and will be submitted to the government. Northern Macedonia's "StopKorona!" Launched a Bluetooth-based application called Detect Contact with potential patients and provide a quick response to healthcare officials.</seg>
<seg id="10">This application is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government said the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development, and would be available in a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing application in Moscow for patients with Kovid-19 disease, designed to ensure that they do not leave the home.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including those false positive results and possible lack of effectiveness if the application is limited to a small portion of the population. .</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the release of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has set restrictions on what kind of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to the Apple Store. It is limited to "official" or, in other words, popular organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly on whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus epidemic will be dismantled when the threat arises. It's over.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">The above-mentioned organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Supervision must be "legal, mandatory and proportional";</seg>
<seg id="21">Extension of supervision should include termination clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">Use of the data will be limited to the purpose of the Quad-19;</seg>
<seg id="23">Security and anonymity of information must be protected and based on evidence;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must prevent discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Sharing information with third parties must be defined in law;</seg>
<seg id="26">To respond to abuse, there must be protections against abuse and the rights of citizens;</seg>
<seg id="27">Significant participation is required by all “relevant stakeholders,” including public health professionals and marginalized groups. The German Disorder Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Seven Greensin Reporters) (RSF) also published checklists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google / Apple plans to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device's operating systems when it is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and has the ability to prevent tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all centralized systems with centralized servers need to have access to personal location data; A number of privacy protection systems have been developed that use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system without an application was used to perform contact tracking.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined it to alert potentially sick people via text messages. .</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to alert potential contact persons, the government should release public access to location information, which has been allowed due to extensive changes in the country's privacy laws since the outbreak of MERS. ده.</seg>
<seg id="36">People have access to this information through a number of applications and websites. Other countries, including Germany, use centralized and confidentiality systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a considerable portion of the literature research being at least as close to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, dozens of groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth reduction. Use energy (BLE) so that the user gets closer to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and does not have a single protocol. In decentralized protocols, proximity protection privacy decentralization (DP-PPT / DP-3T), transient contact numbers (TCN, fka contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols, and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) ) And others.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">Privacy Group creates SafePaths in the MIT Media Lab when it collects and uses intersecting data for location or paths to track COVID-19 spreads, a platform for using privacy protection techniques.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is a platform based on research published in the March 2020 White Paper entitled "Apps Gone Disease: Protecting Privacy in Cholera." Is a company that makes privacy technologies and was originally created at MIT Media Lab as well.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses hardware-secure technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the confidentiality of this information.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups that combined similar approaches and broadly broader protocols aimed at reducing analytics, and globalization in tracking and alert applications. Facilitating collaboration is a key aspect of achieving broad-based use goals.</seg>
<seg id="45">On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has released the BlueTrace protocol as an open source tool used by their official government application.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claimed would protect privacy and reduce Bluetooth-less energy technology and Privacy will be based on cryptography synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the specifications of the original technologies used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system is expected to be implemented in three phases:</seg>
<seg id="49">Implement tools to enable governments to develop official privacy coronavirus tracking applications</seg>
<seg id="50">Integrate this functionality directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple Plan to first update the operating system by distributing the system and then in the same way by removing the data when the threat is over. Solve initial and ongoing monitoring problems.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Regular hand washing with soap during "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread from the hands to the mouth through fecal matter. Is transferred.</seg>
<seg id="3">People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (e.g., mucous membranes). .</seg>
<seg id="4">The five most sensitive times of the day during which it is important to wash your hands with soap are as follows: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's lower extremities or after changing the pump, before feeding the baby , Before and after meals and after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.</seg>
<seg id="5">If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following situations:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after the preparation of food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after patient care.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or cleaning babies who have defecated.</seg>
<seg id="9">After a runny nose, cough or runny nose.</seg>
<seg id="10">After handling with animal, animal feed, or animal waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene habits related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand washing before prescribing medication or medical attention can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main health goal of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is especially important for people who have access to food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for all people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; Prevention of all causes of diarrhea; Reduction of respiratory diseases;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reducing infant mortality at home.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing habits may lead to smaller improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple habitual changes, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ways that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by almost three-quarters, and this is related to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea may be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if it is done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, a major component of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, taking the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhea and pneumonia kill about 3.5 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to UNICEF, regular hand washing before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical procedure, and can lead to half the deaths due to diarrhea and respiratory infections. A quarter of deaths from infections can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is often associated with other hygiene practices as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing also protects against dead grains that are transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only minor detrimental effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, especially among health care workers. In between this condition is common.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frequent hand washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five important times during the day during which hand washing with soap is important in reducing the transmission of disease from feces to the mouth: after using the toilet (to defecate or defecate). ), After cleaning the baby's lower extremities (changing the pump), before feeding the baby, before and after the preparation of food and after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.</seg>
<seg id="31">Other conditions where proper hand washing techniques should be used to prevent transmission of the disease, such as before and after treatment for a cut or wound; After sneezing, coughing and runny nose; After animal waste or animal handling; And after touching the debris.</seg>
<seg id="32">In most countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 hand washing study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that the rate in Saudi Arabia was the highest at 97 percent; The average in the United States is about 77 percent; And the lowest in China is 23 percent. There are many ways to change the habit now to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at important times. Massive hand washing for school children at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to make hand washing a habit in children.</seg>
<seg id="34">The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a level playing field for children’s health and educational development.</seg>
<seg id="35">Treating worms twice a year, washing hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride are the main goals of this national program.</seg>
<seg id="36">The program is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergent to water.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce impurities in the solution, and to increase the solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone is not effective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Proper flow of water only helps with cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soaps, due to their reusable properties, may retain bacteria obtained from previous applications.</seg>
<seg id="42">A few studies that have looked at the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the chances of this transmission are very low because the bacteria are cleaned with soap foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still says that "it is better for most people to use liquid soap for hand-to-hand contact control."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted among health-conscious people.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the proposed use of antibiotic or non-antibiotic drugs is optimal for an antibiotic-resistant organism in nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antiseptic soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of types of resistance to the organism.</seg>
<seg id="47">So if antibiotic-resistant strains are not chosen for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as the ones being marketed.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skin preservatives, as a pH regulator, complex formulas such as the antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin conditions (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract) may contain acidic acids (acetic acid) , Ascorbic acid, lactic acid). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that simple soaps are just as effective in preventing disease and removing bacteria from hands as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps. That contain triclosan.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 ° C).</seg>
<seg id="51">But hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial pressure in the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene substance without water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, as a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol hand wash, hand wash antiseptic, or hand sanitizer) Got fame.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most depend on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed with concentrated substances in the gel such as carbomer (an acrylic acid polymer), or a hemostatic such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam to facilitate use and the drying effects of alcohol. To reduce.</seg>
<seg id="56">Addition of hydrogen peroxide concentrated liquid further enhances the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcoholic synergistic bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungicides.</seg>
<seg id="58">An alcoholic sanitizer containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% of bacteria (equivalent to a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) 30 seconds after tapping on the hands and 1 minute after tapping on the hands. 99.99% kill the tree up to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hand-alcohol sanitizers are completely ineffective against norovirus (or norovac) type viruses, which are a major cause of sarcoma. Adequate antiseptic or alcohol should be applied to the hands to keep both hands well covered.</seg>
<seg id="60">The sanitizer should be rubbed on the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and until the end for about 30 seconds to allow the liquid, foam or gel to dry.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingertips should also be washed well, and rubbed on both cheeks. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are very dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Excessive use of these substances depends on their ease of use and rapid killing action against microorganisms; But they should not take the place of proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Repeated use of hand-held sanitizers can cause dry skin without a skin softening or moisturizing formula.</seg>
<seg id="64">The skin drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and / or other softeners to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain softeners cause less itching and dryness of the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.</seg>
<seg id="66">Sensitivity to contact with dermatitis, contact with urticaria syndrome or severe sensitivity to alcohol or hand rubbing are rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower tendency to stimulate itching with dermatitis has become more noticeable than washing hands with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">In addition to their effectiveness, non-water-repellent materials do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply make them antiseptic.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens still remain on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and texture, and has historically been used less than alcohol and alcohol on hands.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to be more persistent and more antimicrobial after use, and less effective after repeated use, which may have been shown to be more persistent on the skin. Be due to negative reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Most people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dust instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or dust may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, ash is an antiseptic because it combines with water to form an alkaline solution.</seg>
<seg id="76">The World Health Organization has suggested aero or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct hand washing technique proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the transmission of the disease has the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wet hands with warm or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because standing water in a bowl may be contaminated, while water temperature does not make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="80">Apply enough soap and soap to the hands, including the backs of the hands, the middle of the fingers and the underside of the nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people like to wash their hands better when they have soap instead of just washing their hands with water.</seg>
<seg id="82">Rub it for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Moisture creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and for a long time Moisture removes more germs.</seg>
<seg id="84">Rinse well under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">The bowl can be re-contaminated by washing hands.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry your hands with a clean handkerchief or hold them in an air dryer.</seg>
<seg id="87">Down and wet hands can be easily re-contaminated. The most common residual areas of the hand are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the underside of the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and beaten nail polish may pave the way for microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands dry. Dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of disease transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">In developing countries, where tap water and / or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be created to make hand washing easier, for example, water leaking from a hanging barrel or pumpkin that Have proper holes and / or use aero if necessary. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are again water conservation solutions, such as "tap taps or dropped buckets" and other low-cost options.</seg>
<seg id="91">A tippy-tap is a simple technique in which a bowl is lowered with a rope, and the wood moving by the foot pours a small amount of water on the hands, along with soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some discussion on the most effective type of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">Extensive research suggests that paper towels found in most bathrooms are healthier than hand-dried electric machines.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, funded by the paper manufacturing industry, called the European Tissue Symposium, to develop paper handles, hot air hand dryers and other hand tools. Compare the hygiene levels offered by jet air dryers.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing hands and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the fingertips and up to 254% on the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="96">Drying hands with a jet air dryer has resulted in an average 42% increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips and a 15% increase in the number of bugs.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing hands and wiping with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips dropped to 76% on average and to 77% on the scalp. Scientists also performed tests to determine if Does any method of drying result in the possibility of contamination between other toilet users and the bathroom environment?</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet blower, which allegedly blows air at speeds of up to 180 m / s (650 km / h ؛ 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and possibly up to 2 meters away from other toilets. Pollute users and the bathroom environment.</seg>
<seg id="99">The hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 m from the machine.</seg>
<seg id="100">No specific release of microorganisms has been observed in the paper smal. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many manufacturers of hand-drying machines, and the hand-drying machine in terms of hand-drying is comparable to a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="103">The use of wet hand sanitizers for hand washing is an alternative when traveling in the absence of soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">Hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">Medical hand washing became mandatory after a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semilovis found hand washing effective in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="107">One study found that using them reduced the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="108">The medical hand washing method is for at least 15 seconds, and adequate soap and water or gel should be used to soothe and all parts of the hands should be washed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands should be rubbed by inserting the fingers of both hands into each other.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there are bumps under the fingernails, a brush should be used to remove them.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since germs may stay in the water on the hands, it is important to clean the hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and if necessary the exit door should also be opened with paper).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents re-contamination of the hands from those areas.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of hand washing in a health care center is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Medical Journal reports that in many medical environments the rate of hand washing is at an unacceptable level, with many doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, and thus Transmits germs.</seg>
<seg id="116">One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of catheter-related circulatory disorders by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper outlining standard practices for hand washing and hand washing in the healthcare sectors.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization has also published a draft manual on hand hygiene for public comment on its website.</seg>
<seg id="118">The review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="119">Commercial instruments can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to prove compliance with regulations.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to the World Health Organization, hands should be washed in the following "five conditions":</seg>
<seg id="121">After contact with blood / body fluids</seg>
<seg id="122">Before performing antiseptic work, and</seg>
<seg id="123">After the patient's treatment. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soaps ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives the hand-washing substance the power to kill.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such an act of killing germs may be required before performing surgery or in medical facilities where the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms is highly likely. To clean one's hands for surgery it is necessary to have a tube that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or washing iodine should also be present, as well as the hands after washing. There is a healthy handkerchief for drying, a healthy brush for wiping and a healthy tool for cleaning the underside of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">According to this method, the hands should be washed for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">Hand massage for long periods of time (10 minutes) is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="128">When pouring water, water should be prevented from flowing from the side to the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the hand washing is complete, the hands should be dried with a healthy cloth, and the surgical clothing should be wiped off.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand disinfectant before and after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="131">For staphylococcal disease control in hospitals it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20% of hand washing and the slightest additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand washing exceeded 35%. .</seg>
<seg id="132">Washing hands with plain soap causes three times more transmission of bacterial infections to food than washing with antibacterial soap. Applying an alcoholic solution on the hands for an average of 30 seconds and washing hands with an antimicrobial soap has been shown to reduce the risk of microbial contamination by 26% more than the alcohol content of hand rubs.</seg>
<seg id="133">But soap and water are more effective than hand-washing alcoholic beverages for reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands. Improving hand hygiene in health care centers can include educating staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol in hand washing, and providing written and verbal reminders to staff.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed on which of these approaches are most effective in different health care centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a low-cost and essential tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to the challenge of making hand washing a global common practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in many rural areas of Africa hand washing pipes near private or public toilets are very rare, while there are inexpensive options for building hand washing places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, lower levels of hand washing may be the result of a poorly formed habit rather than lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and change people's long-term habits.</seg>
<seg id="140">Monitoring and evaluation are essential for this to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based behavior is effective in increasing hand washing habits in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the promotion of hand washing in schools is the "three star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.</seg>
<seg id="142">Once the minimum standards are met, the school can go from one star to three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">The creation of hand washing sites can be part of hand washing campaigns to reduce the incidence of disease and infant mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of habit change. As a result of the 2019-20 Corona virus outbreak, UNICEF has developed a selection of hand-washing emojis.</seg>
<seg id="145">Several studies have considered the general impact of hand washing costs related to the prevention of DALYs in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation methods.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or injured soldiers - Hand hygiene was first introduced in the mid-19th century. Recognized by two leading physicians: Hungarian Dr. Ignaz Semilovis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale who was English and is the "founder of modern nursing".</seg>
<seg id="148">Many people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called measles.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, foodborne illness and health care-related infections forced the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">The swine flu epidemic in 2009 and the Coed-19 epidemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soaps to protect themselves from such contagious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, posters called "Proper Hand Washing Techniques" have been hung near handkerchiefs in public toilets in Germany and in bathrooms in office buildings and airports.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase “washing your hands” of something means that someone is dissatisfied with taking responsibility for that thing or is complicit in the crime.</seg>
<seg id="153">The text originates from the Gospel message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used phrase in English societies.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth forcibly washes her hands in an attempt to cleanse the imaginary stain on her body, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed, and her husband's. Encourages to do so.</seg>
<seg id="155">It has also been found that people, after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, are forced to wash their hands more often than at other times, and value hand-washing equipment more.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after thinking like this are less likely to engage in other forced cleaning activities, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religions offer hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, that is, the use of water to wash hands without soap, is part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions, such as the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tolstoy, and the Nettlet in Judaism, the Lubbock in Christianity, and so on. Ablution in Islam. Religions also recommend a healthy hand wash, especially after certain activities.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam enjoin washing hands after using the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam enjoin washing hands before and after every meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Outbreaks of coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have so far affected up to 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world. Many have died and more than 80,000 have been infected. This is a catastrophic outcome for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to this homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by nocturnal scurvy and produce similar symptoms through the same mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is more prevalent and affects older people than young people and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on chronic diseases, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will cover the basics of disease prevention, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eliminating the threatening disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and for several weeks due to the outbreak of the new disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coronavirus (CoV) is highly homologous for the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that developed in 2003; Thus, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The disease started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to the rest of the country and around 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, the virus has generated more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "1st degree enemy of the people" and is probably more powerful than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published on its virological pediatrics, etiology, diagnosis, and Treatments have been published including. Since the first report on January 7, 2020, the sequence of the virus was determined to have been excluded from most patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review seeks to summarize research progress in a new and rapidly evolving thematic field.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some of the remaining urgent questions we have learned so far.</seg>
<seg id="16">CoVs have traditionally been known to kill non-communicable diseases in humans, usually causing 15% of the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century, we have twice encountered high-risk human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which actually started in China in 2003 and again in 2012. The disease spread to Saudi Arabia and soon spread to many other countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third most widespread case of CoV in human / human recorded history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1.1, a pneumonia cluster with an unknown source was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.</seg>
<seg id="20">The CoV sequence was released seven (7) days later.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first homicide was reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, health care providers reported the infection, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed with the closure of all public transport.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of onset of the disease from an unknown animal source. .</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, the WHO declared it a global health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and had spread to about 50 other countries around the world. (Fig. 2).</seg>
<seg id="28">As the situation develops rapidly, the final scope and intensity of the expansion will become more apparent.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a new updated description of the disease as follows (https: //mp.weixin). qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SSARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but most are between 30-65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="31">About half of the infected persons (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected patients were under 10 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 affects more men (0.27 / 100,000) than women (0.31 / 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">CoVID-19 was mainly distributed in and around Hobby in clusters.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average duration of contamination was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the regulated R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected people has risen dramatically since January 23. 2020, compared to the big transition time before the Spring Festival in China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (59% 4-02.2: 95% CI).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60), and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoVs are a subfamily of large and covert viruses that have a sensory RNA unit.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four types, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs have been known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">Spike packet (S) glycoproteins for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diphtheria peptides 4 (DPP4) of these cell receptors, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Virus RNA genome released in the cytoplasm After the virus's genome is reactivated, the genomic RNA forms virulent vesicles with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then intercept the plasma membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">SARS-CoV-2 was found as a new type of beta CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identification among the 10 random samples collected from the Hwanan maritime market in the expanding mainland Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="47">SARS-CoV-2 is inherently more similar to SARS-CoV than MAR-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Through transmissible bacilli microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultraviolet parts of the human airway epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the SARS-CoV-2S protein is much weaker than SARS-CoV in human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less common in patients with SARS-CoV than in SARS-CoV. Causes severe infections.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form an unknown short protein that is propagated by orf3b and excreted by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and in the case of IFNβ; However, orf8 has no known active domain or format.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al, reported a full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM structure in a 2.9% contract in the complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex, which has open and closed conditions, was collected as a dimmer and that a mixture of ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, which provided evidence for CoV identification and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be the target of treatment for drug testing to bury SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Source and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in the evening scorpions and were transmitted to humans by cats and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, Shapiro was the main host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs in -SL-CoVZX45. Name recognized. bat - SL-CoVZX21</seg>
<seg id="59">However, what the intermediate host has helped the virus to overcome is a kind of barrier to infecting humans, and the route of transmission is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="60">G, et al, Maran proposed to humans from the late Shapiro as a carrier of the virus which was included in the homologous group within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-mouthed, lamb-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potentially intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 in CoV. 99% based on congenital homology found in penguins and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the spread of the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; Thus, the results of factual evidence are awaited (Fig. 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and can remain under 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity for up to 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="66">SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 C for 30 minutes; Or 75% ethanol, chlorinated, antiseptic, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solutions, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively neutralize the virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">The entire human population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this unknown virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, no detailed research has been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">Typically, after a virus attacks a host, it is first recognized by the host's immune system through sample identifiers (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, all types of receptor TLR. (NOD) as Recipient (NLR), and - (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">In a variety of ways, the virus promotes inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of I-type interventions (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the spread of viral antigens to macrophage phagocytosis.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, the immune response is integrated into the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, including T4 lymphocytes, play an important role in defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8 + T cells directly kill the infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by stimulating T cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nerve immunity Complements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a are also essential against viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, a healthy patient's antibodies replace MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, overwork of the immune system produces large radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 disease, starting with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">It is common for people who are infected with a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to be infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 - 14 days, most of which are 3-7 days based on a preliminary study of 425 cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the contraction period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is very important for health officials to regulate the effective timing of quarantine on a regular basis, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but uninfected people to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a general practice, individuals who have contracted or contracted the disease usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is usually a major and early symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, limb / muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, sneezing, chest pain, diarrhea. Can be combined with nausea / vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experience dyspnea and / or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, patients developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and high fever, even without visual abnormalities of the lungs, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spina bifida, and 3% for diarrhea. Was. ٪ 8 patients need open air.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters caused by transfusions from a non-muscular patient.</seg>
<seg id="95">Relatively, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these require air intake support, more than COVID-19 patients and higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen with MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">In SARS patients, it has been reported that fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), dyspnea (40% - 42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13% -25) had major symptoms and about 14% -20% of patients. Fresh air was essential.</seg>
<seg id="99">On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="100">Relatively speaking, SARS deaths in November 2002 accounted for 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, death was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47 with a 95.7 (CI) interval of 5.71-7.23%, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4. .</seg>
<seg id="103">Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher diffusion capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the last two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, disease control of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">The onset of clusters often occurs in the same family or in the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have contact history in Wuhan or other affected areas for two weeks prior to contact with infected persons or patients.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from hospitals can re-transmit the virus, which has sent a call to increase the quarantine time.</seg>
<seg id="109">Patients have normal or low levels of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &amp;lt;4 × 109 / L, lymphocyte number &amp;lt;1 × 109 / L, and elevated spherical aminotransferase levels and varicose veins were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="111">Liver / liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels in the blood of liver patients were elevated, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte degradation was increased in the blood of most patients.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, which are a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, are elevated, and lymphocyte counts are gradually reduced.</seg>
<seg id="113">Abnormalities in chest radiography were found in most COVID-19 patients and were obscured by a shadow of a bilateral patch or ambiguity of the ground glass in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress (ARDS) syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, irregular controlled inflammation, fluid retention, and advanced fibrosis impair gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Disruption of type I and type II pneumonia lowers surfactant levels and increases surface pressure, thus reducing lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Therefore, radiographic findings of malignant breasts often parallel the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 was performed on synovitis, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multiple diseased synovial cells in a patient's lung that had died of the disease, according to the pathology. . Similar to viral infections and ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, due to the high error-negative levels, which may accelerate the disease, clinical manifestations have been used to diagnose (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) used in China on February 13, 2020. Done.</seg>
<seg id="121">The same thing happened with the diagnosis of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings are essential for an effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is synthetic SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol / L at 200. RNA detects fragments. -18 10-18 mol / L (10-100 copies per microliter of the Internet) Use Diptic in less than an hour without the need for explanatory tools.</seg>
<seg id="124">Hopefully, the new technique could dramatically improve sensitivity and ease if confirmed in clinical samples.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience with uncommon CoV, physicians can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while attempting a variety of treatments that have already been used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These treatments include current and potential therapies including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from acquired patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">Plasma was even suggested for use in patients receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may even attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, respiratory illness and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, respiratory support is important for reducing symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, flawless ventilation, and disease severity.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extraporous membrane oxygen (ECMO), a heart stabilization technique used to treat life-threatening heart and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintenance of electrical balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It has been recognized that cytokine surges result from over-activation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="135">The cytokine storm is part of a systematic inflation response triggered by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release more free radicals, a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunizations are essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tosylazumab, an antibody to IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunity treatments for cytokine storms include T cell-guided immune response modification; Inhibition of IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF; JAK prevention blinatumomab Cytotine signal suppression 4 and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids, as an immune force, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids in high doses were not helpful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">Instead, they may cause serious side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short to moderate corticosteroid short courses are recommended to use COVID-19 with caution in critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous administration with remediation, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remediesweed is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilad to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlberg viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">Subsequently, the recall also showed possible inhibition of other single-infected RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on this, Gilad has set up a center in China to conduct this pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, baricetinib, enteroron α, lupinevir / retinavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhea, inflammation, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combined treatment with lupinevir / retinovir.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction of these therapies with other medications used for patients should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma formation of acquired patients and antibodies</seg>
<seg id="153">Collecting blood from patients infected with an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or preventing the disease in healthy persons has a long history.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, healed patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immune system made by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other foreign substances, and in such diseases recognize specific molecules and directly neutralize them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected in 10 serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammatory and viral pressures and increased oxygen concentration in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, confirmation and clarification are required before specific treatments have yet been developed to suggest a method for large-scale use.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, considering the therapeutic effects, some of the plasma-related lesions must be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can boost the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight global disease is extremely expensive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is very serious and practical to separate B cells from diseased cells and to identify effective antibodies or test codes or genetic codes against the virus's essential proteins.</seg>
<seg id="164">Thus, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a range of diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effects largely depend on the composition of many components in the formula that depend on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most effective components remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and validate the same ingredients or their preferred combinations.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is a great alternative treatment for light-to-moderate patients or those who have returned from a difficult phase.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shen Feng Zhi Do Capsules and Lian Hu Qing Wen Capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The best treatment rates for COVID-19 patients were found in several provinces in China where TCM is used in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningya (50%), and Hanan (50%). , While Hobby the province, which used TCM in only 30% of these COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a bit of a comparison as many other impact factors such as number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) treatment with WM and TCM combined.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM + TCM group than in the WM group alone.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most impressively, the level of symptomatic severity (severe from light) was significantly lower for the WM + TCM group than for the WM-only group (46.2% compared to 7.4%) and mortality compared to the WM + TCM group alone. Was low in. Group (8.8% compared to 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaited in well-controlled trials on large scales and other centers.</seg>
<seg id="176">It would be important to specify the mechanism of action and the effective components of TCM treatment or, if possible, their combinations.</seg>
<seg id="177">Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a great deal of fear of a highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience fatigue, loneliness, anxiety, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of the disease such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause a great deal of anxiety and mental distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of SARS, a series of mental illnesses including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental illness, psychiatric symptoms, depression, and even suicide have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="180">Necessary contact follow-up and quarantine, as part of public health responses to COVID-19 disease, can make people more anxious and guilty about the contagious disease, quarantine, and stigma effects on family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people in contact with them as well as the general public as needed.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic tools and applications to avoid close contact with each other. Be included.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are needed to intervene in the transmission process from animal resources and infected humans to infected organisms and are often complementary to antiviral therapies in controlling diseases caused by viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Efforts are underway to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and potent neutral antibodies and / or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Live-fed vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older persons and the death challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection were still determined before clinical studies could begin.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, MERS-type cases and clusters occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions where zonotic resources persist in unusual regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vitreous, nanoparticles, viruses, particles and regenerative protein subunits and some were evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and serious task to control the ongoing epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, it is challenging to overcome the problem as it takes a long time (on average 18 months) for vaccine development and dynamic conversion of CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an undiagnosed disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course over thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually recover without difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be related to or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor in diagnosing SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">CoVID-19 usually occurs in the age group of 30-65 years, accounting for 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in 8,866 case studies.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients in need of intensive care had the most likely disorders and were significantly older than those who were not between the ages of 66 and 51 years of age, with COVID-19. Patients suggest progestogen as a factor for outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 compared to 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Disorders and disorders: Patients with CoVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to have severe heart disease and arrhythmias.</seg>
<seg id="202">Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver / liver damage in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is important to note that age and the underlying disease are closely related and may interfere with each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Unusual laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammatory or tissue lesions and suggests a possible diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">Correlation of CRV levels with COVID-19 severity and diagnosis has also been suggested.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated lysate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Thus, it is a traditional indicator for heart or liver / liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Major clinical signs: Chest radiography and short-term improvement of clinical signs should be considered, among other issues, to predict and complicate the outcome of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="211">Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immune disorders that are used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors have experienced isocular osteochondrosis with a lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and for short-term use in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="214">Stress: As mentioned above, most patients with COVID-19 have experienced abnormal stress as they often endure confinement and long-term uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and friends. Is.</seg>
<seg id="215">It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replicating in low respiration, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively induce reactions in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild to moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection, unlike other CoVs that Causes a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, patients infected in the first stage or during the incubation period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses a great difficulty for disease control.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are critically ill, while most transitions do not occur in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">Major efforts are currently underway in China, including the ongoing quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the entire population, to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these practices are dramatically hurting the country’s economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the prevalence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end in March and the decline will last for 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">Still, other experts are less optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter, et al, predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, would not be phased out by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Langini, et al., Developed a model for predicting disease outcomes and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in patients with moderate turbinitis and in both throat ducts who recovered 2 weeks ago and were discharged from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could cause Cyclic events like influenza can occur.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, promising signs have emerged based on the declining number of new cases in China, indicating that the current strategy may work.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half a million deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through severe quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weakened in infection and eventually die or remain associated with a low-risk virus in humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Comparison of COVID-19 disease with SVS and Mers (Fig. 55) provided below.</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with a virus-contaminated substance.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in human feces, raising a new possibility of oral-to-oral transmission.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by potentially non-communicable diseases, including 17 other patients with other chronic illnesses and 40 health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="236">Thus, great care must be taken to protect humans, especially those in contact with health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even patients or infected people.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of disease is by wearing a face mask; The use of both a surgical mask and a N95 respirator mask (Series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially diseased organs from traveling through the air or entering material surfaces, where it can be transmitted to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only the N95 (Series # 1860s) mask can protect against respiratory infections of small viruses ranging from 10 to 80 anemometers, with only 5% of viruses being able to enter completely. SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Because particles can insert up to five surgical masks together, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health care providers should wear fit insole clothing to further reduce exposure to viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also infect someone through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; The virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Thus, health care providers must also wear transparent face masks or goggles when working with patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves more often than usual with pesticide soap, try to stay indoors to protect themselves, and limit contact with potential patients. To do.</seg>
<seg id="246">Staying three steps away from the patient is considered a suitable distance for people.</seg>
<seg id="247">These actions are effective methods that reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, its superior homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 should have caused a high alert to China in 2003. The spread of SARS may have been caused by her deep memory.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until January 2020, the director of disease control in Wuhan will reassure citizens that the novel virus has a low human-to-human transmission and is limited in what it can do to prevent and control the disease. No problem.</seg>
<seg id="250">The message calmed people’s anxiety calmly, especially as the whole country prepares for the Spring Festival, and lost important time to prevent the disease, at least in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="251">Disease control agencies in China may learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these agencies should be (1) very careful when making public announcements because every word is valuable to the people and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) More restriction for having a potential illness in the beginning rather than giving people relief. And (4) frequently conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of infectious diseases and periodically inspect and improve the community response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">COVID-19 disease was caused by the unknown virus SARS-CoV-2, which began in late December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, at the time of writing, the disease has spread to China and 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a feeling of SARS recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">CoVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are higher in older people than in young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are critically ill, which causes a much greater difficulty in spreading COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This in part explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, treated patients can be positive for the virus again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">With such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain unresolved, the types of which are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% of the genetic homolog was found between CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 and two shopper's SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the shopper's.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal was the medium-sized animal that transmitted the virus from the original host to the human?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without understanding the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transition, and these events can recur at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular modeling and biochemical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter air cells and subsequently cause pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also linked to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the disease last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it be called worldwide, die like SARS or rise like a flu at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="275">This is necessary but may take some time to find answers to the above and many more questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, at any cost it can, we have no choice but to stop the plague as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The b’A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019.</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no clinical trials have been completed on any of the vaccines, much effort is being made to develop such a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="3">In February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a related or causative virus, in less than 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were five vaccine nominees in the Phase I safety study in April.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cowade-19 was introduced in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">The disease became highly prevalent worldwide in 2020, which resulted in significant investment and research activity in the development of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations are using published genomes to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As demonstrated in April, the CEPI initiative for vaccine development requires acceleration, manufacturing capacity, provision of a certain amount of information, and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, scientists reported that in early 2020 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">The major objectives of the Platform that have progressed in Phase I safety research are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine nominee: Moderna, MRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral vector (first phase developer and vaccine nominee: consonant biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). And 39 others have been announced but with little public information available (considered to be under planning or in the process of being drafted).</seg>
<seg id="14">The Phase I-II test, which is the primary test for safety and immunogenicity, is generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and performed at different sites / locations, with very accurate and effective doses. / Is also a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III tests are usually very participatory. These participants included a control group, the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring for side effects in the hopeful dose / medication.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates approved in the active development phase since early April 2020, 74 have not been tested in a human evaluation (still in the pre-clinical research phase).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around 24 April 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring a possible molecular vaccine vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to trigger an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan or Video-Interview announced the start of work on a vaccine, aimed at launching human trials in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The vaccine development project was announced on January 26, 2020 at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and on January 28 at the University of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around January 29, 2020, the Johnson Pharmaceutical Company, led by Honey Scottmaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Johnson, his biotechnology partner, is making a oral vaccine with the help of Vauxhall.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergency Biosolution announced a production partnership with Vaccart to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On February 8, 2020, the Encyclopaedia Laboratory in Romania presented a research paper on the design of a vaccine with the same technology used for the treatment of cancer with neonatal vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="24">On March 25, the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and began testing.</seg>
<seg id="25">On February 27, 2020, the generic subsidiary company, Nogenerics Immuno-Oncology, announced that they had launched a vaccination project to develop a Li-K peptide vaccine against COVD-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">They want to produce a selective vaccine that can be tested on humans within 90 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 inhibits the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, which contains the metal enzyme and is located on the surface of endothelium and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and the C-terminal cleavage renal amino acid transfer domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single invasive I type membrane protein, which has an enzymatic active domain, and appears on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shidas, and the final soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted through urine or urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 in most organs is connected to the main lung II type ovarian cells, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial cells in arteries and veins, and smooth muscle cells in arteries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ACE2 mRNA form is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum corneum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a balance for ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE secretes angiotensin II into the hormone angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp- Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, apylene, neurotransmitter, denorphine A, and glycine.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates membranes that are neutral amino acid carriers SLC6A19 and have been implicated in heartburn.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63 ؛ SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); And SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 Speck S1 proteins to the ACE2 enzyme domain at the cell surface causes endocytosis and transmission to both viruses and enzymes that reside in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">This induction process also requires the provision of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a possible treatment. This has led some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight the disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, a number of professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE controllers and ARB treatments.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE controllers who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than the general risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Human synthesis of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new treatment for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory tract syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect (duration) for 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who do not tolerate classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients where angiotensin II is elevated. RhACE2 injection for the treatment of acute respiratory tract syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019–20 coronavirus epidemic is a continuation of the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic, which is caused by the acute respiratory illness Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The pandemic was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and on December 30, due to international concerns, the country was declared a public health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, it became a global pandemic again. .</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, an estimated 1.60 million cases of coronavirus had been reported in 210 countries, killing more than 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="5">The death rate in China was 4%, followed by Algeria at 13.04% and New Zealand at 13.04% worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="7">Severe and complex symptoms of the disease include pneumonia, various symptoms of obstruction of the respiratory system, and loss of function of many organs of the body resulting in weakness or death.</seg>
<seg id="8">Symptoms usually appear within five days of infection but in some cases take two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first treatment is symptomatic. It is beneficial to lose the patient and help him. The recommended precautions are important, such as washing hands, holding something in the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from each other, and avoiding suspects. Separation is important.</seg>
<seg id="11">Authorities around the world are enforcing laws such as travel bans, quarantines, curfews, and workplace risk control.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plague has caused severe economic turmoil in the world, ending sports, religious, political and cultural events and a widespread decline in the fear of buying.</seg>
<seg id="13">Universities and libraries are closed on a national or local basis in all 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.</seg>
<seg id="14">Misinformation about the virus has been shared online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, including people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and areas where the virus is endemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">Air pollution and carbon emissions have declined due to a shortage of transportation and the closure of large factories.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of the cases are related to the seafood of Hwanan and it is said that the origin of the virus is zoonotic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cholera-spreading virus, known as SARS-CoV, is a newly discovered virus closely related to the Shapiro Coronavirus, Pangolin Coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person to be infected on December 1, 2019. No contact</seg>
<seg id="19">Two-thirds of the first reported incidents in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.</seg>
<seg id="20">An unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post newspaper on March 13, 2020 in China said that the incident was found in a 55-year-old man in Hubei province on November 17, 2019. Incidents have increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea. For the first time, incidents outside of China have escalated.</seg>
<seg id="21">Cases may be rarely reported, especially in cases with minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">On February 26, fewer cases were reported among young people, including 19 and under-2.4% of the world's population, according to Patrick Valence, the UK's chief scientific adviser.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases refers to people who have been tested for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, not a single country had tested 3% of its population, and most countries had a policy of not conducting low-grade laboratory tests, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a study published on March 16, as of January 23, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and that non-communicable infections accounted for 79% of all cases. Was the source.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to her statistical analysis released on March 30, the number of people infected with coronavirus in Italy is much higher than reported.</seg>
<seg id="27">The basic production number before the initial measurement of COVID-19 is RO (1.40) to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most people recover from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="30">It takes 6 to 41 days for the symptoms to develop, and for most people it is 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 billion deaths have been caused by CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, as of February 5, 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing heart disease and diabetes, generally "officially positive." Provides protocol for testing.</seg>
<seg id="33">The death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher, as it will not include those who have died without testing, for example in homes or nursing homes and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="34">Preliminary data from Italy show that the death toll from COVID-19 is 5x-4 higher than the official death toll.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that (the death toll) had been underestimated. H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first deaths outside the Chinese mainland occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">February 28 Dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy, outside central China.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories and every continent except Antarctica have reported deaths, with more general measures being taken to measure deaths.</seg>
<seg id="39">These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by test volume, quality of health care, treatment options, time after the first incident, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health. The time allotted reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global mortality rate is 6.0%.</seg>
<seg id="41">The numbers vary by region.</seg>
<seg id="42">China's mortality rate has dropped to 0.7% from 17.3% (of those with symptoms between January 1 and January 10, 2020) (those with symptoms after February 1, 2020) Other measures include accidental mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths from the disease, and disease incidence rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of sick (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people. Who have died of disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics have no time limit and specific populations follow from infection to solution.</seg>
<seg id="44">A number of scientific institutions have tried to use these data for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">The University of Oxford Center for Medicine has based evidence that the incidence rate for epidemics ranges from 0.1% to 0.39.</seg>
<seg id="46">The highest levels of this range in Germany are consistently diagnosed with COVID-19, and a statistical study is measuring the effectiveness of the diagnosis on CFR.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization has shown that cholera can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The duration and timing of the disease is uncertain and the location varies accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni of Penn State University says that untreated infectious disease usually begins to fade and then recedes when the disease passes from the existing host.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is not possible to predict when this will happen.</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nashan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argues that this will end by June, if all countries follow the advice given by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Typical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could spread by a year or two.</seg>
<seg id="53">Neil Ferguson, in a study at Imperial College, says it would be necessary to keep a distance and take more precautions "until the vaccine is available (in the next 18 months or more)."</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's possible that this corona virus - because it's easily contagious - will disappear completely and it's possible to become a seasonal disease." Come back every year.</seg>
<seg id="55">The return of the virus will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively "undefined" and patients can go without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are 88% fever and 68% dry cough.</seg>
<seg id="58">A few common symptoms include fatigue, phlegm, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cancer, conjunctivitis, hemostasis, patches or cyanosis. The World Health Organization says one in six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has compiled a list of urgent symptoms that include respiratory problems, chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty falling asleep, and blushing on the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended for those who have these symptoms. The disease can be exacerbated by severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and even death.</seg>
<seg id="60">These patients will have no symptoms and no medical symptoms, but the diagnosis will show the disease, the researcher advised, to keep an eye on those who have been in close contact with the sick. And research to eliminate the infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China has a 44% cure rate without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="62">The time between symptoms and contamination is 14 days, up to a maximum of 5 days, in which case the uncertainty is such that in COVID-19 people the sense of smell is 30% and then 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some explanations for how the disease spread are still in the process of being determined.</seg>
<seg id="64">The first disease is spread through close contact with people, spitting in the air, or by talking to people 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) away.</seg>
<seg id="65">The findings show that coughing in the open air can spread the virus from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">Some people suggest that the virus can also be transmitted in the form of small droplets in the air because it stays in the air for many hours, which does not leave the cell during speech, and respiratory droplets also occur during this breath. But when it comes down to it, the deadly virus doesn't grow naturally in the air.</seg>
<seg id="67">The drops may settle in the mouths or noses of nearby people or may pass into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), also aerate the respiratory fluid and release it into the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">The virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, including the skin, by touching the eyes, nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is also concern that the disease may spread to waste manure but this risk is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have spread from the virus. There is a possibility of pre-publication.</seg>
<seg id="72">People tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of seizures, with the possibility of transmission before significant symptoms develop.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only asymptomatic case reports confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmissions have been identified by some countries during contact-finding investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads easily, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus lives on for hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the virus was detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steels for up to three days, on a board card for one day, and in copper for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">It does, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as with other surfaces that may have been associated with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new virus that has been contracted for the first time in three patients with acute respiratory pneumonia in Wahan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All parts of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in the corresponding corona virus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.</seg>
<seg id="80">The virus is said to have originated in animals.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis reveals that the corona virus is genetically clustered with the beta corona virus genus in the subgenus sorbic virus (lineage B) with two double-stranded strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">It is 96% identical to other cochlear virus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the genome level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in some parts of the genome series there was only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans.</seg>
<seg id="84">A comparison of the entire genome with the date found relatively 92% of the genetic material shared between the pangolin corona virus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficient to prove pangolin to be a medium host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection by the virus can be briefly diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by substitution of the infected product or CT images by polymerase chain reaction.</seg>
<seg id="86">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wahan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its reactions have been associated with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening for COVID-19 diagnosis."</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first published on January 17th.</seg>
<seg id="89">The test uses a real-time reverse transfer polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">Results are usually available in a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Typically this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab while a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are conducting serological tests, which detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of this has been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">Serological tests developed by Selex in the United States are only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Imaging features that are symptomatic in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral grade apoptosis and absent optimization factor.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Association of Radiologists is compiling an international online database of photographic findings for confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to its prevalence with other infections such as adenovirus, photography without confirmation by PCR has limited specificity in recognizing COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large study in China compared the results of CT to PCR and showed that although the reaction is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, considering it as a screening tool in epidemiological areas. Suggests.</seg>
<seg id="99">Strong neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been created to detect viral reactions with both radiographs and CT.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, preventing hands from touching hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and placing tissue directly in the waste container. .</seg>
<seg id="101">People who may already have an infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.</seg>
<seg id="102">Physical distance measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many states restricted or advised all unnecessary travel to countries and regions affected by growth</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading in large parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they became infected. Health care providers care for those who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact confirmation is an important method for health officials to determine the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">Privacy concerns have been raised by governments over the use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose, with Amnesty International and 100 other organizations calling for such monitoring restrictions in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile apps have been implemented or offered for voluntary use, and from April 2020 to 20 expert groups will be working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to bring users closer to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Users then receive the message if they have a close relationship with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spread about how to prevent the disease. For example, nasal cleansing and mouthwash are not effective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is no CoVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop this vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC recommends that people wash often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are exposed. Before eating And after blowing the nose, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bubble.</seg>
<seg id="112">The CDC further recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water were not readily available.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization tells people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth until they have washed their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">Faces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (immerse the stainless steel face in a virus cleaner for at least one minute) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1 Contains% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC indicates that in any office or other location where there is a suspicious or mature corona case, all rooms, bathrooms, shared seating areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, tablets, remote controls and ATM machines that are infected All that is used should be free of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="117">Health organizations call on you to cover your mouth and nose with a piece of cloth or a cloth when coughing or sneezing, and then handle the cloth immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1">Workplace-19 risk control measures in the workplace</seg>
<seg id="2">Workplace risk control measures in the workplace include the use of occupational safety and health methods to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Coved-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Significant risk control measures in the workplace, risk assessment of sources of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for each employee based on the risk of contracting COVD-19. Possibly, depending on the place of work and the job</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA), low-risk occupations have a low working relationship with the public and other employees, leading to the need to take precautionary measures to prevent the disease. Is recommended. Take precautionary measures, tell staff to stay home if they become ill, take precautionary measures against respiratory illness, and clean the work environment on a daily basis. Disinfection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moderately high-risk jobs are those that require constant and close contact with strangers and people suspected of being infected with COVD-19, but may be ill due to ongoing social transmission and international travel. شی.</seg>
<seg id="6">This work environment includes employees who interact with people, such as schools, crowded work environments, and crowded retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to initial disease prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective ventilation of air filters, plastic or glass curtains to prevent parasites, personal protective equipment or devices as may be required from such a person. Even if you are infected with Covid-19, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="8">The United States Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) estimates that healthcare and burial workers, who deal with and suspect suspects of coed-19 disease, are at higher risk of contracting the disease. If staff apply procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles in people with COVD-19 and to collect or use samples from them for testing, the risk of contracting the disease is higher. رسوي.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures that are appropriate for these employees include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and job-appropriate personal safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="10">The release of the Covid-19 could have a number of implications for the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may not be able to come to work due to illness, the need to take care of others, and the fear of getting sick.</seg>
<seg id="12">The way business is done may change. These practices may vary depending on the demand for the goods and the means by which the goods are obtained (e.g., shopping at low volume, or delivering / delivering to the customer on your own or by car). Provide fast services by motorcycle)</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, from geographical areas that have been severely affected by Cove-19, the transport routes may be cut off. A contagious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide safe action.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plans address risk levels related to a variety of workplaces and occupations, including the risk factors for infection, home-based risk factors, and social spaces, as well as the risk factors for older and chronically ill employees.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, the plans identify control measures to address the risks and provide contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may require national and regional recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Responses to the spread of an infectious disease include reducing the rate of transmission of the disease among employees, rescuing people at risk of more complex health conditions, continuing work activities, and other agencies in the supply chain. Is to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="18">The severity of the disease in the community in which the business activities take place affects the reactions that take place.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hierarchical series of risk control measures is the framework that is widely used to classify risk control measures in terms of efficiency in job safety and health.</seg>
<seg id="20">In places where it is not possible to eliminate the risks of CWED-19, the most effective control measures include engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering controls, without relying on employee performance, are the separation of employees from work-related hazards, and may be the least costly solution to implementing this work.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative controls are changes in labor policy or procedures that need to be implemented by the employee and the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal safety equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal safety must be determined based on the perceived risk to the employee, properly installed (e.g., respiratory devices), worn consistently and correctly, inspected regularly, maintained, and as needed. Should be replaced, and should be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The United States Department of Labor Safety and Health (OSHA) says low risk of contracting the disease is a low working relationship with people and colleagues in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first steps to prevent the spread of the disease, which is recommended for all workplaces, are to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, telling them to stay at home if they are sick, and to cover their breath, including coughing and sneezing. Through measures to prevent the transmission of the disease, to prepare containers for paper towels and used items, to prepare for telephone calls or to change shifts if necessary, to prevent employees from using other tools and equipment, And keeping the work environment clean and disinfected on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="27">The most important step in protecting employees, customers, observers, and others in the workplace is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infected people.</seg>
<seg id="28">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home as long as the fever does not reduce or eliminate the symptoms. Dry for at least 24 hours using the medication, the fever symptoms go away, and other symptoms go away. Holiday policies must be flexible, staff must be allowed to care for sick members at home, and staff must be aware of these policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA), moderately high-risk occupations include employees who work with people who are not infected with or suspect of contracting COVD-19. Not cut, 6 feet (1.8 m) in distance or in close contact, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to disease transmission in the community around workplaces or from Due to the disease, the man recently traveled the world to a place where Coved-19 is widely distributed.</seg>
<seg id="30">These include employees who are in general contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density working environments, or in retail stores or places where the number of customers is very high. Engineering controls for these and high-risk groups, efficiently installing air filters, increasing the number of ventilators, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic curtains, speeding up customer service by car / motorcycle Is to do. Recommending sick staff in administrative controls for this level and high-risk groups to stay at home, hold face-to-face meetings through virtual communication, create different work shifts, to places where Quad-19 disease occurs. Dissemination of emergency travel plans, including the creation of a community to respond to employee concerns, emergency communication plans, and the provision of up-to-date information and training to employees on CWED-19 risk factors and safety practices. Provide training on how to use safe clothing and equipment, provide resources and a work environment that includes personal hygiene, the need to wash hands frequently, restrict customer and public access to the workplace, and hand washing Includes installing posters on washing and other safety measures from Cove-19. Employees with a moderate risk of illness should wear personal protective equipment, including gloves, medical clothing, and face masks or goggles.</seg>
<seg id="31">Employees of this high-risk group need very little breathing air.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone is ill on the plane, appropriate controls for the safety of staff and other passengers, to keep a distance of 6 feet from others, to separate from other passengers and staff, to offer a mask to the sick person, and to avoid the patient. Asking the person to cover their mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">The passenger in the cabin should use disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touch liquid or potentially contaminated surfaces, and use other personal protective equipment if possible. The patient may have a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Handkerchiefs and disposable items should be placed in red / hazardous bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. Transportation hazard controls on merchant ships, including long-haul and other passenger vessels, include travel delays when someone is ill, and if someone has a fever and other symptoms of illness on board. It should be separated from the others and the medical personnel on board should be notified immediately.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basically medical supervision should be done in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and child care centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may recommend short-term school leave for cleaning and disinfection if a sick person has a social illness. The publication came to the school without consideration.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a low chance of reducing social transmission, social distance strategies should be implemented, such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or canceling parties at church meetings or cafeterias, up to the tables. Increasing the distance between, changing return and return times, limiting / reducing unwanted visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="37">When the transmission of the disease continues strongly in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distance strategies. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the level of emergency health risk is lower for law enforcement personnel who perform day-to-day activities.</seg>
<seg id="38">Rule of law officials, who may be in contact with CWED-19 suspects or suspects, are advised to follow relevant guidelines, such as emergency medical personnel, including appropriate personal safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in close contact during detention, personnel should clean and disinfect their belts and military uniforms on home-made antiseptic sprays before re-use, and protect and dispose of used personal protective equipment. And follow standard operating procedures for handling and washing clothes.</seg>
<seg id="40">The United States Department of Labor Safety and Health (OSHA) estimates that health and funeral workers are at high risk of contracting the disease.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk job occupations include health care and support providers, laboratory, and medical transportation personnel dealing with and suspecting people with COVD-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">If staff implement procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air and to collect or use samples from them for testing on people with COVD-19, the risk of contracting the disease is higher. رسوي.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles include inserting a tube into the body, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, as well as collecting a large number of samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">Highly contagious burial duties include staff engaged in the preparation of the bodies of people who have been identified or suspected to be infected with Covid-19 at the time of death. If these workers do an autopsy, their risk of contracting the disease is much higher. Additional engineering controls for this hazardous group include room separation for patients infected with CUVID-19 and suspected as well as procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.</seg>
<seg id="45">Special pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and burial centers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be taken considering the previous measures of Biosafety Level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be placed in a separate waiting room in view of the suspected CWED-19 case. In addition to other personal safety equipment, the United States Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) recommends respiratory equipment for employees who work with SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected patients within 6 feet and Employees who perform procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 facial respiratory masks or better should be used in a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program. The program includes appropriate, training and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of breathing apparatus can be used for optimal safety and to provide convenience for the employee. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend coverage, as Covid-19 is a respiratory disease. The disease is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The World Health Organization recommends only medical masks for door-to-door examination personnel.</seg>
<seg id="51">The World Health Organization (WHO) provides surgical masks for those who take respiratory samples from Covid-19 patients, care for them or move them from one place to another without having to perform procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air. Recommends goggles, face masks, medical clothing and gloves / gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">If a procedure is performed to prevent the production of airborne particles, a respirator mask of N95 or FFP2 should be used instead of a surgical mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given that the global availability of personal protective equipment is inadequate, the World Health Organization is creating long-distance hygiene and physical barriers such as, clean windows, reducing the need for personal protective equipment, allowing only those who use personal protective equipment -19 Performs patient care directly, only for specific essential tasks, such as using personal protective equipment without removing a respirator mask while caring for the same patients, supply / supply chain of personal protective equipment Recommends monitoring and coordination, and not prescribing masks for those without symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">B. coronavirus disease 2019 or CoV-19 is an infectious disease that causes coronavirus 2 with symptoms of acute acute respiratory illness.</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asthma.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The onset of symptoms is about five days, but may take two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">While most cases have normal symptoms, some include viral pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million accidents were reported from 210 countries and territories worldwide, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have been rehabilitated. The virus is first spread through small drops during close contact between people, often through coughing, sneezing and talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">While these droplets are produced during respiration, they usually fall to the ground or other surfaces, but are not viruses transmitted over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People can also get the virus by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on different surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is most contagious and contagious within three days after the onset of symptoms, although the virus can spread before symptoms appear or even in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosing the disease is performed by inversion transcription polymerase chain reaction using a nasopharyngeal swab / fill.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of masks is again recommended for those who suspect of having the virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations for the use of masks vary among the general public, with some recommending non-use, some recommending use and some recommending use.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment to treat the Covid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">The disease is transmitted locally to the World Health Organization (WHO) in all six regions, in most countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may have no obvious symptoms or may not have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and asthma.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and pressure, numbness, difficulty waking up, red face and lips; It is recommended to seek emergency medical attention if these signs or symptoms appear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unusually, upper respiratory system symptoms include runny nose, runny nose, or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, vomiting, and diarrhea / diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Initially, in some cases in China, only chest tightness and heart palpitations were observed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease progresses to pneumonia, inactivation of many limbs, and death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation phase.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation phase of the Coved-19 is usually six days but may vary between two and 14.</seg>
<seg id="24">It takes 11.5 days for 97.5% of people with symptoms to show signs of infection. Reports indicate that not all people infected with the virus show symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">Without these symptoms, the role of transporters is still unknown. Nevertheless, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of those infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is under investigation. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remained hospitalized without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since April 1, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) has also started recording non-symptomatic cases in daily cases. Of the 166 people infected with the virus on the same day, 130 or 78% did not show symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was a high level of the virus in the sputum as well.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speaking louder than normal releases more drops.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that an uncontrollable cough can move mouth drops up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although the virus is not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biovirus transmission may be possible and air-collecting devices installed in corridors outside people's rooms have found samples that carry the virus. NA was positive.</seg>
<seg id="32">Certain medical procedures, such as tube insertion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, may cause aerosolisation of the respiratory tract and subsequently spread the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although there are concerns that waste has been transmitted, the risk of this risk is low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms and signs. While symptoms are more likely to spread before they occur, the risk may be lower.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while it is clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people with the virus. The virus survives on the surface for hours or days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the virus can survive up to one day on paper boards, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and air temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soaps and detergents that are used properly are very effective; The soap-related material removes the virus double protective coating, inactivates it, as well as removes it from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconite are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, walking samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="39">In six out of five patients, the first sample showed elevated levels of the virus, and the sixth patient showed elevated levels of the virus on the second day of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="40">Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute coronavirus with acute acute respiratory symptoms, the first of three pneumonia patients belonging to the group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan. Separated.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are caused by coronaviruses related to their nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Outside of the human body, the virus is killed in homes using soap, which breaks the protective cover of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original form of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organs of the body that are most affected by CVD-19, as the virus gains access to the host cells through the enzyme-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which accumulates more in the perforated cells of the second type of lung.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus uses a superficial surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) and attaches to the ACE2 enzyme and enters the cells associated with that enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="45">Acute heart attack was found in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan Province, China, and such incidents are more common in severe illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cardiovascular symptoms are higher during the course of the disease due to vascular inflammatory response and disturbances in the immune system, but heart muscle injury may be related to the ACE2 enzyme receptor / receptor in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors / receptors appear in the heart and perform their function in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the emergency room, high blood clots (31%) and coronary artery disease (25%) were found in people with COVD-19, which may be due to a lack of awareness of the disease. . Evil changes in the structure of the lungs were found in the dismemberment of dead bodies due to covid-19, and lymphocyte-containing inflammation enters the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although the SARS-COV-2 virus has a defense system for the respiratory system for epithelial cells that exhibit ACE2, patients with severe COV-19 have symptoms of systemic high-grade inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, disease-causing GM-CSF secretory T-cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6 secretory monocytes in patients infected with the CoVD-19 virus and with severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in carcasses has also been reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">The World Health Organization has published several diagnostic protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Armahall inverted transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the standard method of examination.</seg>
<seg id="54">Typically, the examination is performed on a respiratory sample obtained through a nasopharyngeal pus. However, nasal pus or mucus samples may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">Examination results are obtained in a few hours and two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">A blood test can be performed, but this test requires two blood samples. The second sample is taken two weeks after the first sample and it takes very little time to get the results of each sample.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate and propagate a genetic sequence of coronaviruses, so that laboratories around the world can independently test polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the disease through the virus independently. To do.</seg>
<seg id="58">On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which include active disease and whether or not a person has already been diagnosed with the disease) were being developed, but have not been widely used.</seg>
<seg id="59">The accuracy and accuracy of the Chinese experiments with the test is only 60 to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">The United States FDA approved the first care test for use on March 21, 2020, later this month. The diagnostic guidelines, published by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical signs and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Bilateral glaucoma is common in emerging, contradictory, and late-onset diseases.</seg>
<seg id="62">Suboptimal dominance and crazy paving (thickening of the lumbar membrane with variable filling of the lung alveolar or hole), and aggregation may appear as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few data on the microscopic tap and pathophysiology of the Coved-19 are available.</seg>
<seg id="64">The key findings of the autopsy are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary edema and pulmonary oedema or accumulation of fluid in the airways and tissues of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="66">There are four types of viral pneumonia:</seg>
<seg id="67">Normal pneumonia: pulmonary oedema or accumulation of fluid in the airways and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large abnormal pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration along with interstitial / perforated inflammation, and large multicellular cell formation.</seg>
<seg id="68">Acute pneumonia: Inflammatory secretions in the pores of the lungs along with abnormal changes in the structure of the lungs (DAD).</seg>
<seg id="69">Abnormal changes in lung structure (DAD) are caused by symptoms of severe respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Reconstructive pneumonia: Inflammatory secretion and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in the lung cavities.</seg>
<seg id="71">Bleeding: Extensive intravenous hemorrhage (DIC); Lucorithroblastic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the chances of contracting the virus include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining a good respiratory system, and Unclean hands are to avoid touching the mouth, eyes, and nose.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing. It is also recommended to cover the mouth and nose in the absence of a paper towel.</seg>
<seg id="74">Proper hand hygiene should be followed after any coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">Also, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using face masks in public places to reduce the risk of virus transmission from a person with symptoms. The goal of social distance strategies is to reduce the level of contact of HIV-infected people with more people by closing schools and workplaces, imposing travel restrictions, and canceling large public gatherings.</seg>
<seg id="76">Distance guidelines also require that people be at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is clearly no effective cure for COVD-19 yet. Although the vaccine is not expected until 2021, the key to preventing COVD-19 virus is to reduce the spread of the disease to a high level. Attempts, known as "curve leveling".</seg>
<seg id="78">The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands several times for 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their hands are dirty / dirty, before eating and after eating. After nasal cleansing, coughing and sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">The center also recommends the use of a hand sanitizer / disinfectant containing 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are clearly not available. In places where hand-held commercial sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulas for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">In this formula, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to help kill bacterial eggs. It is "not an active substance to kill germs on the hands".</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a diluent.</seg>
<seg id="83">People are managed with supportive care. These care include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and assistance to other vital organs / organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people with the virus wear a simple mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Oxygenation outside the body (ECMO) is used to treat the problem of impaired respiratory function, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="86">Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive treatments are useful for those who have normal symptoms in the early stages of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) and China's National Health Commission (NHC) have issued recommendations for the care of people who are bedridden due to Covid-19 infection.</seg>
<seg id="88">Intellectual and pulmonary specialists in the United States have published treatment recommendations from various agencies as a free resource, the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some physicians recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first use to relieve symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautionary measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities when performing procedures such as inserting a tube into the body or manually inhaling a patient that may be in the air. Produce particles.</seg>
<seg id="92">For health workers caring for people infected with the CVD-19 virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) includes standard precautionary measures, contact precautions and airborne precautions, including airborne virus isolation room (AIIR). Recommends placement of a sick person in. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during cholera.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended items and equipment are: personal protective medical clothing, respirator or face mask, goggles / eye protection device, medical gloves / gloves. If possible, a respirator should be used instead of a face mask.</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of the mask under the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">These masks are designed to protect against particles such as dust and grime in the air, but their effectiveness against a particular biological virus is not guaranteed, without marked use.</seg>
<seg id="96">When there are no masks, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using home-made face protectors as a last resort.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most cases of Cowade-19 are not severe enough to require a mechanical respiratory ventilator or an alternative device, but in some cases these devices may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">Types of respiratory assistance to reactivate respiratory system in patients with COVD-19 have been actively studied in the hospital. Some evidence suggests that pipe insertion should not be used during nasal breathing pipe or ambient air positive pressure machine (BiPAP).</seg>
<seg id="99">Whether these two methods will work equally well for those who are critically ill remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors prefer to use a mechanical ventilator through the mouth because this type of technique greatly limits the distribution of airborne particles rather than inserting a respiratory tube into the nose. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60, and especially those over 80).</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries do not have enough beds in hospitals for everyone. This limits the capacity of the health system to control the sudden rise in the number of Cove-19 cases that need to be hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5% of patients were hospitalized in the ICU, 2.3% needed ventilator mechanical assistance and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">In China, about 30% of patients with COV-19 are hospitalized in ICUs.</seg>
<seg id="104">Mechanical ventilators become more complicated when the symptoms of acute respiratory illness are exacerbated in Covid-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ventilators with a pressure control mode and PEEP capacity should increase oxygen delivery levels, while also reducing the risks of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.</seg>
<seg id="106">High-level PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on a possible treatment began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs are being tested in clinics.</seg>
<seg id="108">Remediation seems to be the most promising cure.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although the development of new drugs may continue until 2021, many of the tested drugs have already been approved for further use or are already being tested in an advanced form.</seg>
<seg id="110">Antiviral drugs may be tested on severely ill people.</seg>
<seg id="111">The World Health Organization calls on volunteers to take part in tests on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. In cases where the patient's life is severely and urgently threatened, the FDA has granted temporary official permission to give a repaired patient plasma as an experimental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="112">This experimental treatment has not been tested in clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to help fight the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are asked to enter their name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The application can detect “close contacts” and the potential risk of infection using monitoring data.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of the other three users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a potential hazard is found, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health authorities. Large-scale data analysis on mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence are used to monitor sick people who have made contact with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor the mobile data of people who may have Corona.</seg>
<seg id="119">The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom shared mobile location data collected with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to conduct research on the virus and prevent its spread.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia employs facial recognition technology to identify and locate quarantine breakers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galleira, said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of the population was moving around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government granted a 48-hour holiday over the weekend in the presence of more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kirsty Kozulin has called for a five-pronged solution to the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience depression due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or illness / virus.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline are hurricanes hurting people's mental health and well-being."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease may pass in a normal state in addition to the presence or absence of certain symptoms and in the presence of other common throat diseases such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Normal events usually get better within two weeks, while severe and severe events may take three to six weeks to heal.</seg>
<seg id="129">Based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk due to the severity of Covid-19 disease, but there are no relevant data on Covid-19. The lungs of some people infected with COVD-19 may be affected and cause pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In severely affected people, the Covid-19 virus may rapidly develop symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARDS) resulting in a failure of the respiratory system, the spread of the virus throughout the body, and in many parts of the body. Cause a drop in activity.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications related to CVD-19 include the spread of the virus throughout the body, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.</seg>
<seg id="132">Blood clots, especially during protrusion of prothrombin, have been found in 6% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19, while abnormal renal function is found in 4% of this group. Has been observed in patients.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20–30% of people with liver transaminase enzyme levels showed an increase in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days in addition to five days in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="135">In addition, people who were transferred to the ICU room had an average time between bedside and death of seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to an early case study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with the total duration of patients becoming ill and the total time leading up to death being six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study by China’s National Health Commission, the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological examination of lung samples after death showed lesions of both lung tissues as well as inflammatory secretion of cellular fibromyxoid in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Cytopathic changes in the virus were observed in pneumocystis.</seg>
<seg id="140">The picture of the lungs was similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory disease.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, troponin levels and heart-related heart disease have been overlooked.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the United States, according to March data, 89% of bedridden patients had pre-existing symptoms. Access to medical resources and the socio-economy of an area may affect casualties.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of death from such a situation vary not only because of regional differences, but also because of methodological differences.</seg>
<seg id="144">Showing a lower number of normal events can lead to higher than expected death rates.</seg>
<seg id="145">Nevertheless, the fact that deaths due to infectious events in the past mean that the current death toll is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Non-smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be severely infected with the Covid-19 virus and about 2.4 times more likely to be hospitalized and die in the ICU. Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">Hong Kong hospital officials noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in people who had recovered from the disease and showed organ damage in a lung scan.</seg>
<seg id="148">This may affect the patient's physical, mental, and emotional symptoms after he or she leaves the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="149">Until March 2020, it was unknown whether or not previous illnesses would have an effective and long-lasting immunity in people recovering from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">Depending on the behavior of other forms of coronavirus, changes in immunity are likely to occur, but cases of coronavirus surviving CoV-19 after positive tests have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="151">The belief in these phenomena is that they lead to the worsening of chronic disease rather than new germs.</seg>
<seg id="152">The belief about the virus is that it is a natural virus and originates from animals through a wide range of microbes.</seg>
<seg id="153">The original source is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost completely from one human to another.</seg>
<seg id="154">A study of 41 confirmed cases of CWED-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The earliest date for the onset of symptoms in the World Health Organization is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">A number of measures are commonly used to determine the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="157">These numbers vary based on each region and over time and include the volume of examinations, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the disease, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender. , And all health is affected.</seg>
<seg id="158">In late 2019, the World Health Organization used ICD-10 disease emergency codes. Code U07.1 for deaths confirmed in the laboratory to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and Code U07.2 for deaths that have been clinically or epidemiologically infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The laboratory was diagnosed without confirmation. The death-to-event ratio includes the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time.</seg>
<seg id="159">As of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate is 6.9%, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics.</seg>
<seg id="160">The numbers vary from region to region. Other measures include accident mortality which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease, and viral mortality which reflects the percentage of people infected with the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed) from one. Have died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not prepared in a timely manner and monitor specific people infected with the disease through recovery.</seg>
<seg id="162">While antibodies are not produced in many sick people, the presence of antibodies may provide information on why so many people become infected.</seg>
<seg id="163">A small village in the center of disease onset in Italy, Castiglin de Base, home to 4,600 people, has already died in 80 (1.7%).</seg>
<seg id="164">In Ganglit, the disease was spread through carnival festivals, and spread to the younger generation with a relatively low mortality rate and thus the deaths of all those infected with Covid-19 may not be officially hidden. .</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German health system has not yet come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="166">According to blood donor assessments, perhaps 3% of people in the Netherlands had antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">69 confirmed people (0.004% of the total population) have died from Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">Cholera effects and mortality rates vary between women and men.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to research in China and Italy, the death rate is higher among men.</seg>
<seg id="170">Their risky age for men is 50 years, with the gap between men and women closing at only 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="171">In China, the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="172">The main reason for this gender difference is not known, but genetic and functional factors may be the reason.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-based immunological differences, which are less prevalent in women than in men, and the presence of multiple diseases at the same time in men than in women, such as high blood pressure in adolescence, may increase their mortality. .</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from CWED-19 were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not monitored the sex-related data of CoV-19 diseases.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS viral diseases affect men and women separately.</seg>
<seg id="177">A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of contracting the virus.</seg>
<seg id="178">The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "Coved-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adanom Gabriasus, revealed that the name CO comes from Corona, VI virus, D disease and 19 for the time the disease first started and was identified: 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid referring to a particular geography (such as China), zoo, or a group of people. The name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations aimed at preventing defamation. The virus that causes Covid-19 is called coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2, which has symptoms of acute respiratory illness.</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, the World Health Organization has used "covid-19 virus" and "covid-19-causing virus" in its general statements.</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".</seg>
<seg id="183">At the onset of the disease in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were known as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 Guideline on Diseases and Diseases.</seg>
<seg id="185">Official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers make health products and accessories such as nasal cleaning cotton fillings and respiratory parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, when a hospital in Italy saw the need for a respirator, and the supply company did not provide it on time, a new operating company made 100 caps in one night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the first outbreak of Covid-19 disease, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the source, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans can transmit viruses to certain animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Research has failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in ducks, hens and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">International research on Covid-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched a “isolation test” to assess the therapeutic effects of four available antiviral compounds in the hope of efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no vaccine available, but many agencies are actively developing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Previous work on SARS-CoV has benefited because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine development strategies are under study.</seg>
<seg id="197">The goal of the researchers in the first strategy is to create a vaccine for the entire virus.</seg>
<seg id="198">The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is to stimulate the human body's rapid response to the new Covid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy involves the development of sub-vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system against the sub-components of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies should be used for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began in Seattle on four volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains a genetically harmless code from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent potentiation has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has sparked much debate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Since April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials will be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">In seven trials, evaluations of previously approved treatments for malaria were performed, with four studies being performed on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Many Chinese studies have included studies of other ailments, with nine countries conducting Phase III tests on the remediator as of late April, according to reports in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic study of clinical development for the Covid-19 vaccine and drugs has been conducted. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of the Covid-19 are under evaluation and research. Including remediver, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinevir / eritanvir and lupinavir / retonavir as well as interfera beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">There has been experimental evidence of remedial effectiveness since March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical progress has been observed in the treatment of rehabilitated patients with low use of remediation.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">Nevertheless, a joint review of the research is called for.</seg>
<seg id="212">Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">In addition, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while prescribing a dose of one gram per day, notes that taking a dose of this drug twice a day can be extremely dangerous and possibly fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent request for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat patients infected with Covid-19 in response to physicians' requests. , Ribavirin, or eumifenovir use is also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data show that excessive use of ribavirin is necessary for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in test sites.</seg>
<seg id="216">Extensive research of nitrazoxanide in test sites was recommended after the SARS-CoV-2 virus showed a low concentration of inhibitors. It is important to enter SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="217">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine research with and without azithromycin have many limitations that have prevented the health community from using them in therapy without further research. Oscillomavirus does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in trials and has no apparent role in the treatment of CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms can complicate the health situation in the severe and late stages of CUVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine antifungal properties. Following the completion of a small study, the Chinese National Health Commission also included the drug Tosilizomab in its treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">After showing positive results in acute patients, Phase 2 of the randomized test is performed nationally in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="221">The purpose of this test, which is related to the examination of serum ferritin blood to detect cytokine storms, is to prevent developments that are thought to be the cause of death in some affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine symptoms based on previous case studies that are caused by any isolated cause, CAR T cell, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="223">So far, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that toxilizumab should be considered an effective treatment for CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">Transfer of pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVD-19 to those in need is being studied as a non-vaccine method of inactivated immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tested for SARS without results.</seg>
<seg id="226">Virus neutralization is a promising mechanism of action by which inactivated antibody therapy strengthens the immune system against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="227">But other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis, are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of inactivated antibody therapy The use of monoclonal antibodies is also under development.</seg>
<seg id="229">The production of serum from recovered patients, which involves the removal of fluid from the blood of healthy patients and the use of specific antibodies to the virus, can increase the number for rapid spread in the body.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia have lowered their supply of toilet paper</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings the Australian shopping chain Wolverhampton and Coles eased restrictions on the sale of toilet paper to two or one package at a time at all stores nationally.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a package limit on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These limits were set in the form of warning messages at exit entrances and on the chain's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report, the buyers were stockpiling for fear of being quarantined due to Quaid-19.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Wolverhampton also lowered the purchase limit for a toilet paper house to one bag.</seg>
<seg id="7">The changes come after the last four beds were introduced by Wolverhampton and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles said in a March 8 media report that, given the four-pack limit, "most stores sell their items within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented," on the other hand Aldi on Tuesday He called it a "surprise" in a Facebook post.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Wolverhampton spokesman said sales were "very high" last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Costco store in Canberra also limited the authorized quantity limit to two last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">To mitigate the shortfall, Coles asked suppliers to increase large packages and deliveries, Wolverhampton ordered additional stock, while Aldi provided stock for the planned special Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmermann, chief executive of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase stockpiles, but that this was due to a local council ban on trucks.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects production prices to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, Alde announced that after the stock ran out, some stores would not be able to run on special Wednesdays.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer of the Queensland University of Technology says the stores cater to the crowd every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that toilet paper is a big item, and in small quantities, and that when sold, the space in the large cupboards becomes empty, giving a sense of lack of stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Klose and Wolverhampton have an idea that if there are more items in the closet, and if there are more items such as toilets and sanitizers, there may be less risk.</seg>

<seg id="6">This month we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Covid-19 epidemic is something that illuminates our global human internal relations and the responsibilities we have towards each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We do not have a history of these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of international sympathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cooperation and attention we have received from our colleagues through emails, phone calls, and online conversations is the remarkable credibility and trust of those passionate human beings who fortunately work with one of them.</seg>
<seg id="10">I can't thank you enough and I'm proud to count you among my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, someone shared with me an appreciation for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They reminded me of how important it is for the world to know that we can turn to Wikipedia, and as an important resource it is a powerful symbol that is online and accessible to all.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is made possible by your work whether you leave the website open or take money from colleagues or want to keep the community safe.</seg>
<seg id="14">More than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a moment that, no matter what we do or how we do it, may have a meaningful effect on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments in the way we work together starting next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjust to your work and schedule</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our strategy and timetable for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">In these conversations, we thought that what we think would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and in doing so would be the best way to keep the organization or institution stable and firm.</seg>
<seg id="20">Strongly we wanted to relieve the pressure and support our mission in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to dial it again, no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors, and contractors:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily work expectation is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until the next news.</seg>
<seg id="24">We don't have any vacations - if you can work more than normal hours, the mission can use you.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the world today is not very predictable, and for us your well-being is a priority, whether you care for your well-being, buy a home business or go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not monitor your time.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are sick, do not work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has to be done without saying, yet we tell you.</seg>
<seg id="29">No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedules to make sure key parts of the work are covered.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you find the Cove-19 result to be positive, please let Brian T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help you and make sure your situation is properly addressed by management).</seg>
<seg id="31">Hourly employees are paid in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have said before and again respect the commitment of our contractors and hourly staff.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each will be paid based on their normal hours under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also included if you are sick and unable to work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people around the world take advantage of their work as a way to shift their pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do is incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like it is now.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it means taking care of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="39">Your request is that you talk to your manager, that you know what to expect and that you can adjust yourself accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some things are considered important.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are some things we need to do.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp;, safety and investment attraction teams (among others) are doing important work that may require further assistance.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin a process with all agencies to assess current objectives and focus on supporting what is important to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are so many agencies doing this for us, we should all focus on the most important projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">For now there is no pain after soaking.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not plan to "double the time to prepare" for the end of the plague.</seg>
<seg id="47">You are not expected to do this extra work to meet the deadline, as this is now imaginary and unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="48">We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and schedules.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens with annual planning?</seg>
<seg id="50">In line with our new reality and in line with the expectations of daily working hours, we plan to align with the timetable for presenting our 2020-2021 annual plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time for budgeting and gives employees the opportunity to prioritize important work, self-care, compassionate care, while their Placement that seeks to work in the coming weeks with a reduced schedule.</seg>
<seg id="52">Extending scheduling greatly reduces the volume and pressure of current planning work throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update the delegation and teams on new initiatives upon receipt of approval.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office status, illness coverage, and cleanliness</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we received news that our SF-related staff might have been infected with the Covid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nevertheless, taking a series of precautions, we deployed an anti-virus cleanup team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They use a hospital-level antiviral solution to disinfect every surface as well as the lobby and the left side of the floor that leads to our floor.</seg>
<seg id="59">The maintenance work in the building uses protocols and uses materials that contribute to the safety of the tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel comfortable that the office will be properly prepared upon our return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located at WeWork which has shared the Quid-19 protocol with us and DC related staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">Since last week, our DC office has been relocated entirely to a remote location in accordance with a shared guide with San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As our relevant partners in New York City know, we are discussing and renting a space in Brooklyn on our own.</seg>
<seg id="64">The talks are ongoing, but may be delayed.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is the first time some of our colleagues have worked in remote areas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our long-distance colleagues understand that this may be a form of discipline, and would like to offer you some advice:</seg>
<seg id="67">Limit the length of the meeting time to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If longer meetings are needed, consider how these meetings can be divided into several parts over the course of several days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Be clear about the purpose of the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading material before the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="70">Shorten videos using Google Docs and Zoom tools to create live help and collaboration and connectivity.</seg>
<seg id="71">Choose a leader to organize each meeting. Someone to monitor conversations on questions and follow up on the speaker list and someone to help take notes (or take notes jointly).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a comfortable microphone or headphones, send an email to the Technology Support section.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your convenience payment for breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Human Resources Activities Team looks at a webinar-based ergonomic guide to support distributed work across the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week we asked recipients of community-related contracts to cancel Wikimedia-funded public programs, such as Editatons, until the World Health Organization (WHO) has eradicated the plague. Announced.</seg>
<seg id="77">We have informed them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for us to carry out activities based on their contract and that no one will be allowed to delay these activities and change the objectives. Is fined.</seg>
<seg id="78">We will begin monitoring other guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and community thematic conferences next week.</seg>
<seg id="79">The general sense of the international community seems to be frustrated by the chaos, but relaxed in its clarity and ability to focus on its communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">Going forward, CRT is working on creating a page in Metawiki to create an environment for the community to monitor the impact and track our interactions with them.</seg>
<seg id="81">Dealing with related issues of Kwid-19</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar on Thursday, 14:00 UTC / 07: 00 PT, for a special working meeting.</seg>
<seg id="83">We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions and spend time interacting with each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are together in this and if so we can help each other.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, you can continue to find information in this email address and find other important information related to Quad-19 in the Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will post up-to-date information on these pages and keep all information in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We also work to maintain ongoing contact with employees who currently live in the most affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about travel, programs, major work processes, coverage-related challenges, or anything you need help with, you can without hesitation know CRT or work with them.</seg>
<seg id="89">We want to offer help and build relationships if needed.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have confidential and sensitive information, please send it by email to Brian Juden, Head of International Human Resources Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">No change should be seen as a relinquishment of work and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rather, it is a kind of recognition that at such a time our work and responsibilities must be organized in a way that was not previously organized.</seg>
<seg id="93">These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue our work, manage our activities with the help they need, and serve the world in a way that they can. Can be trusted.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will be waiting for us in due course.</seg>
<seg id="95">For now it is time to support each other and create an atmosphere for the important work that may be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need you to achieve this goal, and we ask you to take care of yourself and your family, so that you will be ready and equipped when the need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!</seg>

<seg id="1">Updates on COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" are required</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, we released a quick consultation guide to the diagnosis and treatment of our new new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) contagious disease, and these guidelines presented our experience and the worldwide spread of this common contagion. Provides good information to combat the disease.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, coronavirus is a new disease of 2019 (COVID-19), our awareness and knowledge is increasing regularly based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experience; Therefore the diagnostic and treatment strategy is constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter we provide an overview of our guidelines and provide new diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition). Is, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, which is now officially named Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named Coronavirus, a severe respiratory disease. 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was inserted.</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a common communicable disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and published it online on February 06, 2020 in Military Medical Research.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.</seg>
<seg id="9">But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is constantly increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experiences; Therefore the diagnostic and treatment strategy is constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), January 16, 2020 and March 2020. 3, has published all seven editions, some of which have been extensively modified.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now that our guidelines have been reviewed by Zhou et al, they have offered a score based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and is valuable information for this common infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">We appreciate their hard work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, information on their functions should also be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines and recent studies for COVID-19 (Trial VII).</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), in order to confirm a suspected case, the epidemiological history must be combined with two pieces of clinical evidence to form a comprehensive analysis, or must complete three pieces of clinical evidence. If there is no apparent epidemiological history.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious Disease History: (1) Travel or Residence History in and around the city of Wahan, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 diffuse cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) Patients from Wahan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where they have reported COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease with a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Had (4) a history of contact with confirmed case groups; 2 cases with fever and / or respiratory symptoms in a small area such as home, office, school classroom, etc. within 2 weeks Came to</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection with pictorial form; (3) The number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased, or decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case based on one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence materials: (1) real-time positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) Virus sequencing the entire genome showing high resemblance to the new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody and SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody in serum examination; Either the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody goes from negative to positive, or the material ≥4 rises in the recovery phase until it is in the hard phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples has been added in the second (January 18, 18) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) versions; And then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to search for a kit to detect high levels of nucleic acids for quick diagnosis, and to take blood samples from the respiratory tract, which added to the presence of differentiated samples, and confirmed Supported to bring particularly positive results in the standard.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, there is additional evidence that we should treat patients with normal symptoms and asymptomatic care.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, Zhou et al. Work map information should be updated, as those without clinical signs were classified as “low risk”.</seg>
<seg id="24">The scoring system should also be approved in other clinical works and studies.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, we hope to see more direct evidence and ask readers to comment.</seg>
<seg id="26">To diagnose “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we propose to follow and obey the new guidelines of our countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team has updated their guidelines over time to provide assistance.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the deaths of five more people due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bangladesh Epidemic Control and Research Agency (IEDCR) yesterday released a report on people infected with the corona virus, including 114 people who are still infected with the virus, and 33 cases. Also included is that the disease did not heal and it remained in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="5">A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online news briefing, IEDCR Director Dr Mirjadi Sabrina Flora said the dead included four men and a woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dr Meerjady said two of the dead were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that two of the victims were residents of Dhaka.</seg>

<seg id="2">The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday announced an outbreak of the Coed-19 epidemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-Co-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on governments to take action if the word "plague" spreads the disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">All countries can still change the duration of the epidemic.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are methods in laboratory laboratories for the 2019 Coronavirus respiratory disease 19-COVID and the existing 2-SARS-CoV virus by which the presence of the virus is detected and the body produces antibodies against the virus. .</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR that diagnoses the corona virus RNA.</seg>
<seg id="3">In March 2020, the original protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified as a target for post-infection treatment.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to identify the most recent and active culprits.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody (serology) detection can be used for both diagnosis and care.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, both those with very mild symptoms and those with obvious symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact rate of death due to the disease and the level of public safety can be determined by the results of this test.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to limited testing, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus among its people until March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, not a single country had tested more than 3% of its population. Most countries had a policy of not conducting laboratory tests with the lowest symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">This diversity also has a high impact on reported mortality rates, which may be higher in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">The test uses a real-time reverse transfer polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="12">Results are usually available in a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="13">An RT-PCR test performed on a throat sample is valid only in the first week of illness.</seg>
<seg id="14">The virus can then disappear from the throat and enter the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">For those infected who are being tested in the second week, alternate samples are taken from their deep respiratory tract using inhaler tubes or septum.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the first PCR tests was performed at a charity in Berlin in January 2020 using a series of real-time descriptive reverse polymer reactions (rRT-PCR) and donated 250,000 thermal thermometers to the World Health Organization. Pave the way for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UK also conducted a test on January 23, 2020. On January 28, 2020, a company in South Korea called Kogenibeuch conducted a clinical scale to determine the temperature based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2. Make the device.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is looking for E genes and specific SARS-CoV-2. released by the beta coronavirus. 2. Obtained a license to use a temperature detection device. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Accurate Time Diagnostic Tool (RT-PCR) to its public health laboratories through internationally recognized sources. .</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the three genetic tests of the old test kits resulted in inaccurate results due to poor performance and caused a test interruption at the CDC in Atlanta; This led to only 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">As of February 28, 2020, tests performed on two instruments were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted until state and local laboratories allowed the tests.</seg>
<seg id="21">These tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration through an emergency use permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are available nationwide with the benefit of RT-PCR.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostic also provided access to COVID-19 tests across the country on March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions were announced, sample collection and processing should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">COVID-19 tests in Russia were developed and conducted by the State Research Center for Virus Recognition and Vector Biotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="26">The test was registered on February 11, 2020 by the Federal Service for Health Care. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic announced a COVID-19 diagnostic test. On March 13, 2020, Roach Diagnostic Company received a license from the FDA to conduct such tests on a large scale in three and a half hours, so that approximately 4,128 tests will be performed in 24 hours through a single machine.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA allowed Abbott Laboratories to make emergency use of the Abbott m2000 test. Similar licenses have already been issued by the FDA to some laboratories, such as Halogic, Lab Corp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, Seafide was also licensed by the FDA for a 45-minute emergency use test.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA approves tests that use thermal nucleic acid fortification technology instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">This method can detect positive results in at least 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes as there is no need for a series of alternating heat cycles in this method.</seg>
<seg id="31">About 18,000 of these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to speed up production of these machines to perform 50,000 tests a day. A test method is being developed in Taiwan that uses an individual antibody that binds to the coronavirus nucleoscoped protein (N protein). Take 15 to 20 minutes like a quick flu test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 literature review concluded that "chest radiography has little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may be present even before the onset of symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="33">Bilateral glaucoma is common in acute, contagious, and late-onset diseases.</seg>
<seg id="34">Suboptimal dominance and crazy paving (thickening of the lumbar membrane with variable filling of the alveolar or perforation of the lungs), and aggregation may appear as the disease progresses.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wahan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its reactions have been associated with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="36">By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening for COVID-19 diagnosis” Until March 2020, the WHO proposed the following definitions of cases :</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to germs is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These cases are used to monitor people, to identify the immune system, and to diagnose those who show symptoms in the first 7 days or so. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through a care test (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">Highly automated systems in most clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the cost of production for each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">A membrane blood sample for CLT is commonly used, although continuous samples are used for immune system photography.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by perforating the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike the PCR method, the pre-test exit phase is not necessary. As of March 26, 2020, the FDA has named twenty-nine companies that have provided notification to the agency as needed and is now able to dispense their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA through an emergency use license. At the end of March 2020, the Eurovision Medical Laboratory and the Epitope Diagnostic Laboratory received European approval for their test instruments, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and therefore the viral RNA is much faster than the PCR test.</seg>
<seg id="45">Antibodies are usually diagnosed 14 days after the onset of the disease. In early April, the UK found that none of their purchased diagnostic tools were useful.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has set up a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they insult him, send him back and after a while will get the test result. The UK's NHS has announced that it is developing a scheme for testing suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient becoming ill if an ambulance or ambulance is needed. Drive-by-trial testing for COVID-19 for suspected cases, the healthcare specialist sampling using appropriate caution.</seg>
<seg id="47">In-car diagnostic centers have helped South Korea make its tests faster and more comprehensive than in other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Physical Physicians of Legal Health Insurance said on March 2 that it has a capacity of about 12,000 tests through planetary diagnostics and 10,700 tests were taken last week.</seg>
<seg id="48">Expenses are borne by health insurance when the request is made by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests a week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, tests were proposed to be conducted in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">The total number of tests conducted as of March 26, 2020 was not known as only positive event figures were released.</seg>
<seg id="52">Preliminary laboratory surveys showed that by the week of 2020/12, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been performed and that 33,491 sample cases (6.9%) were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including this week. In Israel, researchers at the Technin and Rambam Hospitals have developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients at a time, which is done by combining multiple samples, and testing positive in combined samples. Performs further tests if events occur. On February 5, 2020, BGI in Wuhan set up a 2,000-square-meter emergency diagnostic laboratory called Huyan (Chinese: 火 眼 or fire eye in English) in Wuhan. Will process more than 10,000 samples.</seg>
<seg id="53">By overseeing the construction and taking 5 days time by BGI founder Wang Jin, the modeling shows that the cases in Hubei had increased by 47% and the cost related to quarantine resolution would have been doubled if this testing capacity had not been maintained at the same time. Wow.</seg>
<seg id="54">Wuhan Labs was immediately followed by Huan Labs in all 12 cities in China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.</seg>
<seg id="55">As of March 4, 2020, the test capacity was 50,000 tests per day. In summary, Origami Assisted has published designs that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be performed in small laboratories without the need for a mechanical liquid catcher.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, the lack of knowledge and insufficient amounts had become a problem for mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">Some authors were forced to explore sample preparation protocols that included temperature samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 min to release RNA genomes for further examination. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people per capita for coronavirus than any other country, and had reached the level of screening people that had tested most of its population.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was through the combination of capacity from the patient’s location, and the purchase of a group-level group-based testing laboratory from the 42nd and BGI groups (based on the Wei “Hu-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">Established in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first laboratory in the world to conduct such tests outside of China.</seg>
<seg id="60">The genetic profile of the corona virus targeting different segments and performing different testing procedures developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a German approach to producing cats in low-income and resource-poor countries.</seg>
<seg id="62">German policy published on 17 January 2020 The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not developed until Jan. 28, which delayed existing inspections in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the validity of test kits at the onset of the epidemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="63">Conversely, experts say the wide range of screening possibilities in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Large-scale inspection capacity in private sector laboratories was built by the South Korean government over a period of several years.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for speeding up screening programs, which is the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 cholera. The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of soaps and chemicals has been tightened.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem in their inspection kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, test kits created by the CDC had "flaws," after which the government again removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private laboratories from conducting tests. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioavailability Biotechnology, but later found that the results were incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company responded that the erroneous results may have been due to a problem in collecting the sample or improper use of the kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said it would return the kits that had erroneous results, and instead would receive different inspection kits from Shenzhen Biosphere Company. 80% of cats give wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China after the results were found to be incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matthews suggested that it should be turned into the Danube. Atish Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said there were "high-level errors" in test kits purchased by Turkey from China and that "they were not used". The UK imported 3.5 million test kits from China. Purchased but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were unusable.</seg>
<seg id="71">Tests with positive results, patients were quarantined and follow-up of those who had contact with people with SARS-CoV-2 positive results, the results were positive.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first death site for COVID-19 in Italy, have twice examined the entire population, about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected patients were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">Due to the limited travel to the community, the new disease was completely eradicated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Following unsolicited contact, restricting domestic travel, inspections, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus disease in Singapore progresses much slower than in other developed countries, and such as forced closures on restaurants and retail stores. There are no serious restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many ceremonies were canceled, and Singaporeans advised people to stay home until March 28, but schools reopened on time after the March 23 holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the disease by pursuing random contact, restricting internal travel, inspecting, and quarantining, but with lower rates of lockdown.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that in terms of the number of deaths, the death rate is much lower in countries that have undergone more tests, perhaps because these countries are better able to identify people who are only few or No symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 submit their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO for approval. Send clients to 16 laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the 16 client laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the chart below, the column “Positive as a% of inspection” column is effective from the country’s inspection policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country that only examines people who visit hospitals has a higher positive% of examinations than a country that examines all people, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things are equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapid Outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the European Union and the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">Cases of the coronavirus coronavirus (COVID-19) show similar cases in EU / EU countries and the UK confirming this, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is all over the country. Spread rapidly in countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and care unit units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 20, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported to the agent a new coronavirus now known as Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been termed Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, for example shortness of breath with or without pneumonia, and most are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 14% of Ca cases, COVID-19 develops a very serious illness that requires a hospital bed while the remaining 6% of cases experience a serious illness that requires serious care.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hospital mortality due to COVID-19 is 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we evaluate the total incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) country and UK and compare it with Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK in Italy between 31 January 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">COVID-19 cases in the UK and EU / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, COVID-19 spread geographically and the COVID-19 epidemic is now dynamically trailing the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">At Euro Surveillance 2020 on 5 March in Spiteri et al, the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Europe according to the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in returnees from Hubei, China, and Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU / EEA countries and the UK, while between 31 December 2019 and this date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported. Of the 17,750 cases, 1,441 deaths were reported from Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Obtaining the total number and accumulated cases of CoVID-19 cases</seg>
<seg id="19">At the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), confirmed cases of COVID-19 are counted in every country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities. And the World Health Organization (WHO) broadcast daily at 8:00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="20">This information has been used to assess COVID-19 incidence in the EU / EEA and the UK, and it is being compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a sign of the expansion of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a 14-day low total incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus looking at the COVID-19 natural course during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020. Captured in every EU / EEA country and UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">We present the total number of confirmed cases in each country on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 AM, compared to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">COVID-19 cases in the UK and EU / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="24">Over a 14-day period this process was followed by an increase in COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK generally following Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the total incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased significantly around February 28, 2020 (supplemental items).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is often due to a rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU / EEA countries and the UK have shown similar increasing levels of COVID-19 (complementary material) aggregate cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries in the UK and in the UK for the period January 31-March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">It points out that, at 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU / EEA countries and the UK had reported similar cases to Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">The severity observed in COVID-19 cumulative cases suggests a comparable progression of cholera in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, with differences in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions across countries, different protocols for patient selection and follow-up testing that must be tested for COVID-19 approval. Be done.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed serious care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these areas already had their own Reached high capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">Admission data documents for COVID-19 cases in the hospital and / or intensive care unit are currently available at EU / EEA level only for ٪ 6 and ٪ 1 cases, respectively (data not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they should be systematically collected to complete the current monitoring documents / records that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A 2010 study found a significant difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with beds ranging from 29.2 per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less the same resources as Italy (care and intermediate care beds were 12.5 per 100,000 population in 2010-11).</seg>
<seg id="37">Modeling scenarios related to health care capacity control, with estimates from each EU / EEA country and hospitalized in UK hospitals. Risk assessments are presented at the sixth ECDC.</seg>
<seg id="38">As cases are still clustered in EU / EEA countries and some regions in the UK, and hospitals and care unit units usually determine the local catch population, information on cases and care beds should be preferred. Be prepared in the name of field units. Level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Countries, hospitals and care unit units should thus prepare themselves for health care for the continued social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, who need to focus on health care, and in particular The species requires serious care, as is the case in affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As noted in the ECDC Accelerated Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a control condition to a mitigation method, as the expected rapid increase in numbers Cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to design, accept and implement their response if they do not act ahead of time.</seg>
<seg id="42">Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the disease to mitigate the effects of the global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a short window of opportunity while countries are likely to step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health care stress.</seg>
<seg id="44">Failing that, the health systems of other EU / EEA countries are likely to face an increase in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zonotic origin / sources of human corona viruses</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutations and adaptations have co-ordinated coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause minor illnesses, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spread of Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become a coin metal that shows how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has once again brought CoVs to the forefront and we are surprised by its high transmission side but more psychological than its sister SARS-CoV. Reduced the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">HCoV infection is zoonotic and understanding the zoonotic principle of HCoVs will serve us well.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoVs originate from shoppers where they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intermediate storage hosts of some HCoVs have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="9">Animal host identification has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insights into CoV-induced disease in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on their discovery history and the main sources of their zones and intersection transitions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compare different HCoV viruses with virus evolution and genome recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">Current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this section.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the need for a successful host and the effects of virus evolution on disease severity have also been highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Corona viruses (CoVs) belong to the Corona viridae family, which is a group of infected, positive-feeling, single-stranded RNA viruses.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes in the group of RNA viruses and are called "CoVs" because of their crown-like morphology under an electric microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoVs have uncut parts genomes that share the same organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-ended open-reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyproteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designed nsp1 ~ 16</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Access proteins belonging to a series are encoded by different numbers of CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on differences in protein configurations, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta CoV), in which the beta CoV gene contains the most HCoV and is divided into four series ( A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Polygenetic evidence has shown that scorpions and mice act as the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta CoVs, while birds are the main sources of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoVs have been constantly evolving from a variety of disorders and some have emerged as major human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 Alpha CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause common symptoms, such as the common cold and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a higher chance of developing upper respiratory tract disease.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first patient of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the common cold in the mid-1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, more information has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, the concept was widely accepted that being infected with HCoVs is generally harmless until the onset of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="33">SARS, which occurred in 2003, is the deadliest case in recent history, and has infected more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% of all cases.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has caused a persistent infection in the Arabian Peninsula and will spread to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 2019 novel (HCoV (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and As of March 3, 2020, it has infected 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm bells are ringing and the world must be prepared for the next epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin from shoppers, mice or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">The lines of evidence support the evolutionary principle of all HCoVs from shoppers, where viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 disease presented great medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the original sources of HCoVs zones provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors of type coding.</seg>
<seg id="41">This may make it easier to guide or search for SARS-CoV-2 reserves, intermediate and expanded animal hosts (s), which have important implications in preventing future spoilers.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review we present the zonotic principle, the intersection transition and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we address the common issue and discuss that parental viruses of HCoVs are non-infectious, especially in their natural host hosts but become diseased after transition to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also look at the evolutionary state of HCoV in which an increase in transmission capacity often accompanies a decrease in disease.</seg>
<seg id="45">The ongoing results of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed in this section.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E B814 was inhaled from the nostrils of patients with normal human disease, various CoVs were isolated in various diseased animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, ducks, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract patients during 1966, and was then applied to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, bronchitis, sore throat, fever, and cough seen in 10% to 20% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and subsequently from cerebellar passages in the brains of lung mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which in other respects are inseparable from microbes with the respiratory disease triangle such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they are transported during warmer climates in warmer climates.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, the transition time of these two viruses is less than a week, and the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to a human voluntary study, healthy people who were infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few immune patients showed severe low respiratory influenza.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "epithelial pneumonia", is the first widely known infectious disease caused by HCoV in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was discovered in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="60">As a result of SARS disease, 8,096 cases have been reported with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to the high prevalence, it was estimated that each case progresses to approximately 4 secondary cases, the duration of intercourse ranging from 4 to 7 days and the weight gain of the virus appears on the tenth day of illness.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients with SARS-CoV develop initially with myalgia, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lymphopenia, liver / liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="64">Reducing alveolar damage, increasing epithelial cells, and increasing macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately ٪ 20-30 patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to shortness of breath, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be affected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with impaired immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of relatives of an index patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from the Netherlands in late 2004 from a 7-month-old baby.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was initially found in adolescents, adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="71">The presence of chorea, conjunctivitis, fever, and lung germs is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study in the Netherlands exemplified the isolation of the underlying virus in the pneumonia of an 8-month-old boy.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is really distributed globally.</seg>
<seg id="74">HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and its highest incidence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibitory laryngitis, also known as croup.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was removed from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute ischemic disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">HCoV-NL63 Similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing less respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four of these socially acquired HCoVs are well-normalized in humans and are generally less likely to cause more pathogenic diseases, while the incidence is caused by unknown causes such as HCoV-NL63 more viral subtypes. Occurs in a variety of events. It has recently been reported to cause shortness of breath in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and keep themselves constantly in humans, they also become less dangerous or diseased.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first removed from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in 2012 who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="82">While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, import cases have sometimes been reported in close European relations in various European countries and Tunisia.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary illness occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is particularly specific to MERS in HCoV-induced diseases.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients present with gastric symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases reported a high of .4 34.4 million, making Mers-CoV the most deadly virus known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From mid-December to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients identified with SARS-CoV-2 disease were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 a respiratory illness, a global public health emergency, and renamed it COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of crude / unconfirmed death cases.</seg>
<seg id="91">Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China is ٪ 4.2, while outside of that it is ٪ 1.2.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory illnesses such as CoV and MERS-CoV, which are presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.</seg>
<seg id="93">Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can lead to the development of acute respiratory disease syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of ٪ 82, they are clustered in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a less cancerous disease but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows several benefit differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the incubation period and HCoV disease duration are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this section, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general condition of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, COVID-19 signaling intensity exists between SARS-CoV and four socially acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show forms that are more common during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of undefined, mild, or even no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting ways in which both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV are characterized.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least significantly higher than that of community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity decreases after transplantation in humans as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 must be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">Oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however, plays an important role as evidenced by future studies in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may explain the seasonality as in the case of community-acquired HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the SARS-CoV-2 form will be effective for the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 after its transmission in humans, including its transmission, disease and continuous spread.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four community-derived HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well administered in humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown better compatibility with these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans. And humans who developed severe HCoV disease have been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this to happen, HCoVs must be sufficiently replicated in humans to allow adaptive changes to combat host limitation factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">This means that the longer SARS-CoV-2 disease persists and the more people become infected, the more likely it is that it will become fully known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well known, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, the community’s four acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, becoming common cold in immune subjects.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal stock.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, high carcinogens - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well accepted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to conserve and propagate in their zoonotic resources and look for opportunities to promote dubious human goals. Possibly through one or more medium and advanced hosts.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has a form similar to both SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and HCoV obtained from four communities.</seg>
<seg id="123">It's as transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is much less pathogenic / diseased than community-acquired HCoVs and less susceptible to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether this will fully apply to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the main animal sources of HCoVs, it would be helpful for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoVs evolution, natural resources, medium and expansion hosts.</seg>
<seg id="127">An animal acts as a host of the evolution of HCoV if it is related to close ancestors that share a high homology in the number of nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="128">The old virus is often well-known and non-communicable in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the storage host maintains HCoV continuously and for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host has a natural disease and is the natural host of HCoV or as the parent of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">Conversely, if HCoV is introduced to humans before or around the introduction of a new host to a new host, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often contagious.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a hosting role by transmitting the virus and then transmitting it to humans by increasing the size of the human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can carry out a death-end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission to the central host.</seg>
<seg id="134">In contrast, HCoVs can coordinate with a medium-sized host and even generate long-term profitability.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural resource host.</seg>
<seg id="136">Considering the epidemiological data it has been revealed that the case of SARS index has a history of contact with animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent surveillance studies revealed that animal traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the livestock market, masked squirrels (Pygoma larvae) and raccoon dogs were first identified to transmit SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly supported by the fact that there were no more SARS reports after killing all the sieges in the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, the report that masked fish from wild or farms without access to livestock markets was largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked fish may only be a medium-sized host but not a CoV. - SARS is not a natural resource.</seg>
<seg id="141">Significantly, since 80% of different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that small mammal species may also serve as the host of a moderate increase in SARS-CoV. .</seg>
<seg id="142">It all seems to host the end of SARS-CoV death.</seg>
<seg id="143">In search of a natural host for the SARS-CoV, the nearest related CoV evening revealed Shaperk, referring to the SARS-related Rhinolofs CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is available in Chinese horseradish shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="144">These shoppers are positive for the genome sequencing of SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 and SARS-CoV antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other Schroeder CoVs share 92-88% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have laid the groundwork for a new concept that cat hosts the evolving human cortex.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several SARS-type corona viruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the late Shapiro, but none can be isolated as a live virus except for one virus identified as WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a SARS-CoV receptor.</seg>
<seg id="149">Unpublished samples from the nostrils of the nostrils showed in WIV1 that the virus used the nocturnal sphincter, Zabad, and the human ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">It is noteworthy that the serum or blood of SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in the nostrils, with 95% nucleotide series similarity.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although there are many similarities between the two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV and that the evening squirrel is not a close protector host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV in the same group as the nocturnal CoV-HKU4 and the nocturnal CoV-HKU5.</seg>
<seg id="154">Both the nocturnal Schwartz CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host, the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.</seg>
<seg id="155">RNA - The series of MERS-CoV-related RNA polymers is closely related to the phylogenetically similar beta-CoVs known in Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in the wild evening squirrels.</seg>
<seg id="157">The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the nocturnal CoV-HKU25, have only 87% nucleotide series similarity.</seg>
<seg id="158">So the evening show may not be the closest host to MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arabian camels have positive results for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, just as saw camels in many African countries are Middle Eastern camels.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, is isolated from the nasal fluid of Arabian camels, suggesting that camels are the main protectors of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that for the experiment, MERS-CoV-infected camels generally showed mild symptoms but the virus was more widespread.</seg>
<seg id="162">Infected camels not only infect the respiratory tract but also in the mouth, which is also the main source of the nocturnal herpes virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, questions remain as most of the confirmed cases of MERS have no history of any contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, apparently attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown routes of transmission that are unknown. Included are animals that have MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide resemblance to the lateral Shapiro CoV RaTG13, isolated from the Rhenolofus aphenis evening Shapiro.</seg>
<seg id="165">In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the series difference or distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to determine the genetic link.</seg>
<seg id="166">This means that the evening scorpion may not be the host of the SARS-CoV-2 long-range protector unless the near-term coronavirus is also found in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host animal must have been purchased at the Henan Seafood Wholesale Market and among the slaughtered wildlife, to the extent that most of the first cases of COVID-19 were related to the animal. Nor is it a sign of a possible human-to-human transition.</seg>
<seg id="168">A number of recent studies based on the metagenomic series have suggested that endangered small animals known as lamb sisters (Manis yawanika) may also have inherited beta-CoVs linked to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These genomes of the new pangolin CoV have a combined series of nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2 from 85-92% of homology.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are similarly closely related to RaTG13, which is about 90% similar to the nucleotide chain.</seg>
<seg id="171">In the phylogenetic genealogy, viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are grouped into two sub-family groups, one of which has a very similar recipient mixing area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, which is 97.4. % Amino acid series is similar.</seg>
<seg id="172">Significantly differentiated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD, although the size of the genome-wide homology range.</seg>
<seg id="173">A previous study of diseased sheep eaters also reported finding a viral disease from the lungs, which is similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study used different methods of integration and manual fabrication to produce a three-dimensional genome sequence whose synthesis is approximately 86.3% full-length of the viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">We also cannot rule out the possibility that the lamb sister is one of the host animals of the SARS-CoV-2 mediator.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the currently differentiated series between SARS-CoV-2 and lamb sister SARS-CoV-2 that are related to beta-CoVs, the origin of the lamb sister and SARS-CoV-2 is straightforward. There is no supporting evidence.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that of SARS-CoV-2 and lamb sister SARS-CoV-2, which are related to beta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="178">The growth pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in beetles, sheep and other animals has not yet been found.</seg>
<seg id="179">While a high homology range has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and sheep sister, high-grade genomes between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 -The wide range has shared homology.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly probable that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is due to the enhanced integration of optimal mediators.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another proposition then advocates reproduction between lamb sister SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a promoter of growth power, reproduction among beta-CoVs is very widespread.</seg>
<seg id="183">Judgment of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still a long way off.</seg>
<seg id="184">Animal origin of high-dose patients HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from succulent CoVs, while the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 hereditary viruses may have originated in the mouse family.</seg>
<seg id="186">The ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically related to another covalent CoV, named Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19/2008, which was found in Ghana, while in the camel family it is the host of the medium. There is also doubt.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, a summary of the currently available information on the origin of HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Historically phylogenetic analyzes have provided evidence to support the transmission of HCoVs between animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">When HCoV-OC43 came to humans from domestic animals around 1890, an infectious respiratory infection was recorded.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of HCoV-229E transmission between animals is less clear.</seg>
<seg id="192">Alkaline alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">Among these is alpaca alpha-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="194">A number of different pieces of evidence support the transmission of viruses between smokers and humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, it is possible that humans in the ecosystem did not have contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="196">However, humans have a close relationship with the alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, drinking alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are different and do not cause disease in drinking, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Consequently, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpaca acquires HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, alcoholism is a direct source of human-borne viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Neptune virus, and the Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while sucking alpha-CoVs act as a source of HCoV-229E inheritance, alpacas and a buffalo camel may be the intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, such as those infected with MERS. -CoV shows the case.</seg>
<seg id="203">Drinking MERS-CoV is a good example of the spread between a goat and a goat from humans to animals.</seg>
<seg id="204">The origins of MERS-CoV growth from drinking have been identified in the early stages and have been supported in recent findings.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is clear that sucking is a rich source of viruses between animals to spread between hereditary pieces and animals.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity, overcrowding, close social interactions and strong ability to fly are all supportive factors that make a drinker a suitable spreader of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="207">MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been transmitted to a buffalo camel over the decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It has become well accustomed to these animals that have transformed from an intermediate host into a stable and natural resource.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very low levels of disease and largely maintains a low level of mutation in these animals.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its random transmission to humans is a phenomenon and humans are the host of the end of MERS-CoV because its spread cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id="211">In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of camel sister, if any, is different in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, sheep's beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in sheep.</seg>
<seg id="213">In the case of SARS-CoV to cat families, they may be a host of end-to-end beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="214">The possibility of differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans in future studies in animals should be accepted or not.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, the virus may be the source of the same host as the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may have a common environmental area similar to drinking through butchery or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, sheep eater may be an increasingly intermediate host to whom the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with the virus through butchery and eating prey.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many animals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">A survey of domestic and wild animals is required for antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, the re-synthesis and habituation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in third animals that interact with both mammals and sheep.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also underway.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to the different types of host animals, three important viral factors are also important for facilitating the transmission of CoVs to animals.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, the higher the rate of change in RNA reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, the estimated conversion rate of CoVs may be "moderate" to "high", and the average conversion rate is -4 10-4 per 2 fields per year, and that The new host depends on the CoV stage.</seg>
<seg id="226">CoVs have an exorbitant nucleus correction, the removal of which results in a high degree of change and reduction or non-continuation.</seg>
<seg id="227">Significantly, the nucleotide analogue remediator has been identified to inhibit the reproduction of CoV through this exorbitonuclease and RNA-related RNA polymers.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remedyswire is highly potent against SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested clinically.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the conversion rate of CoVs is almost one million times higher than their host.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, conversion rates are higher when CoVs are not well accustomed to the host.</seg>
<seg id="231">With a higher rate of mutation than SARS-CoV, it is observed that the rate of conversion to SARS-CoV-2 is lower, which means higher levels of habituation in humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It may already be accustomed to a host close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant for MERS-CoV, which is well accustomed to a buffalo camel.</seg>
<seg id="234">Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutations will soon prove ineffective against vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and antivirals.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the large RNA in CoVs uses more flexibility in genome mutation through genome mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of joint-growth between animals, which is beneficial for the formation of new CoVs when the conditions are right. .</seg>
<seg id="236">This support features 3% encoded open reading frames at the end of the genome and more specific function of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, CoVs modify random and reproducible templates during RNA reproduction through a special “prescription selection” mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="238">In a host that serves as a joint vessel, wire change occurs frequently during CoV RNA recording.</seg>
<seg id="239">High-level similar full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be reunited to produce new CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and HCU-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Transmission-related virus-host communication</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the transmission between animals is another important factor in the viral relationship with the host.</seg>
<seg id="243">Therefore, re-synthesis of SARS-CoV has been taken as a common example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during animal-transition events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on comparative analyzes between SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV in humans and cats, it is thought that the rapid transduction of RBD mutations in different hosts, particularly S proteins, is thought to occur.</seg>
<seg id="245">Typically, the S protein RBD of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, the RBD in the S1 fragment is contained in 318 to 510 amino acids that bind to human ACE2 and other receptors for viral entry.</seg>
<seg id="247">SARS-CoV, RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including cats, cats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to spread between animals.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, it has been observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD differ from humans and wild cats and 4 of them are located in the recipient-linking scheme for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">Cat SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the susceptibility of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, mutations in both of these amino acids may be important for humans to get used to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has similar cell receptors to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the human may have altered the tendency of the S protein to bind to ACE2.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a cryo-EM study has shown a high level of binding interest from 10 to 20, as far as between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.</seg>
<seg id="254">It will also be of interest to determine if any of the partner recipients may be required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but to a different part of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are several receptors for HCoV, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">After spreading from their animal host to the animal they may also be considered for the successful habituation of these CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell recipients, the outcome of the spread of HCoVs between animals is also governed by other host needs and limiting factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">The differentiation of these host proteins between HCoVs such as aphids, a buffalo camel, mice, humans and a host of natural resources may be a barrier to the spread between animals.</seg>
<seg id="260">For successful spread among animals, HCoVs must go beyond host need factors and eliminate host limitation factors.</seg>
<seg id="261">Therefore, molecular factors in this important area of ​​virus-host interaction still need to be identified and explained.</seg>
<seg id="262">The use of state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-wide randomization of SARS-CoV-2 host requirements and barrier factors.</seg>
<seg id="263">Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the original place</seg>
<seg id="264">Many types of drinking CoVs provide many opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="265">Therefore, drinking HCoVs is the source of the HCoVs gene pool.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also contribute to the growth of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this series.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, acquiring or losing new protein-encoding genes has the potential to drastically alter the viral phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among the SARS-CoV companion proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human habituation, as the SARS-CoV-related adipose viruses have been isolated but found to encode different proteins of ORF8.</seg>
<seg id="269">The removal of a 29-nucleotide characteristic of SARS-CoVs can be found in isolated viruses that initiate human infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="270">This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a habitual change in the induction of host switching.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of a possible recombination of the family Alpha and Gamma-CoVs, where small areas of RNA-related RNA polymers have been found to regenerate.</seg>
<seg id="272">The return synthesis locations are also known in nsp9, many nsp10, and nsp14 segments.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV infectious disease has experienced a relapse among different families, occurring in a camel in a buck in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition, the re-synthesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in their non-natural structure genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be borne in mind that artificial selection may play an unintended role in altering viral genomes, to a large extent resulting in the release of viruses from the induced stressors, such as by the host immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="277">While complete ORF4 can be seen in sucker and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, an individual nucleotide of alpaca alpha-CoV binding is shown, resulting in mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">As a result, the growth of new HCoVs in their host resources is also driven by selective pressures.</seg>
<seg id="279">Asymptomatic disease or only mild to moderate disease has been found when drinkers are infected with CoVs, indicating a joint habit between CoVs and drinkers.</seg>
<seg id="280">Drinking seems to be automatically and physiologically accustomed to CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, disorders in inflammatory response activity in rats actively reduce pathological activity by CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in rats is inhibited due to the inhibitory activity of natural killer cell receptors NKG2 / CD94 and low levels of basic equivalent I grade molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced due to the high metabolic activity of the drink can prevent both CoV regeneration and the correction effects by exorbitonicles, so when a highly hostile virus hosts a new host Being transferred to provides the preferred pressure for production.</seg>
<seg id="284">Most infected CoV viruses may change with re-synthesis, and take new proteins or protein forms to get used to the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">Therefore, it is unlikely that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">CoVs are non-morbid in their host's reservoirs such as beetles and camels or cause less disease.</seg>
<seg id="287">They reproduce quickly without the host immune system responding strongly.</seg>
<seg id="288">So there is a mystery as to why asymptomatic patients are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to the high activity of the immune response and the cytokine storm, which means that the stronger the immune response, the greater the risk of lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">In other words, the immune response in asymptomatic patients is isolated from the reproduction of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="291">A similar immune response isolation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">The interferon response in the drink is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, administering type I interferon in the early stages of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, NLRP3 has an inflammatory effect on inflammation in rats.</seg>
<seg id="295">With this argument, prevention of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theory that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.</seg>
<seg id="297">While it has been found that a single beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is also a single-drink bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">While cats and other animals have been found on the market that carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the near-medium host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">Finding that sheep's beta-CoVs are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that sheep eaters may be intermediate hosts or that sheep's beta-CoVs may be responsible for SARS-CoV-2. Participate with gene fragments in the resulting sample.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or inadvertently created by humans.</seg>
<seg id="301">CoVs have once again become common due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">Studies of CoVs in beetles and other animals have greatly altered our understanding of the transmission of HCoVs to humans and the importance of storage and animal origin in animals.</seg>
<seg id="303">The general evidence has shown that the main source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is ingestion and is transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that the origin of the SARS-CoV virus is from the interaction between humans and cats in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the killing of cats could have effectively eradicated the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">Based on the same argument, sheep feeders should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal spread, as sheep feeder beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of links have been found.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through rats or other animals should be clarified in future research.</seg>
<seg id="307">MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long been present in a buffalo camel.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels serve as an important source of transport for the local people as well as a central source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wet markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To prevent the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to create an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV, among other measures to control the spread of camels.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we cannot eradicate the virus, new genotypes can emerge and spread.</seg>
<seg id="313">There are many types of CoVs in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="314">Drinking CoVs in particular have many species with animal potential.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities to alter and synthesize these animal CoVs, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are highly contagious in the future and / or fatal in humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be avoided in order to reduce the need for human-animal interactions.</seg>
<seg id="317">A preparedness and response plan should be developed for SARS, MERS and COVID-19 problems.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They remain in their natural resources as long as they have the opportunity to spread.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although aphids have many forms that contribute to the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with aphids and other wild animals can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.</seg>
<seg id="321">Continuous monitoring of animals is essential to gain awareness of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of the host, which in future releases will prove useful in preventing the spread of the virus from animal to human.</seg>
<seg id="322">Consequently, the most effective way for humans to prevent animal viruses is to stay away from the natural resource environment of animal viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">A number of fragments in the SARS-CoV-2 animal origin puzzle are still missing.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if the hereditary SARS-CoV-2 spreads to hedgehogs, it would be interesting to see under what conditions suckers and ewes may share the same environmental area.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if drinking has a direct role in spreading to humans, it must be understood how humans come into contact with drinking.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third animal acts as the host of the main mediator, how it interacts with various animals, including humans, reptiles, and sheep-eaters, it should be clear.</seg>
<seg id="327">Consequently, since many animals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental transmission should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a beetle, a sheep or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or hereditary viruses that are closely related will be introduced into its natural host in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Ongoing research in this area will explain the growth pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control outcomes of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
