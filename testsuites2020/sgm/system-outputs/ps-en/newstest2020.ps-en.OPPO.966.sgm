<seg id="1">B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to help track contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus disease, for example, the process of identifying individuals ("contact") who may have been in contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some regions and powers, various apps were developed or proposed with the official support of governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many frameworks have been developed to create a contact tracking app.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems developed based on tracking the geographical location of app users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Few compromise alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to get the user inside other cell phones in close proximity.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether or not they were in contact with people who have Covid-19 disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.</seg>
<seg id="9">The app was developed by the local IT community, which is published as a free source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia launched a Bluetooth based app called "StopKorona!" To detect contact with potential patients and provide a quick response to health care authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">Until 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 April, the government said the contact tracking app is in its final stage of development, and will be available in a few weeks. A similar app is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app in Moscow for patients suffering from Covid-19 disease, and is being developed to ensure they don't go out of the house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems in app-based systems, including those false positive results and a possible lack of efficiency if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add Coronavirus-related apps to the Apple Store. It has restricted them only to "official" or, in other words, popular organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners expressed their concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly regarding whether the established surveillance infrastructure to combat the Cronavirus outbreak would be destroyed when the threat ended.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The above mentioned organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Supervision should be "legal, compulsory and proportional";</seg>
<seg id="21">Extending supervision and supervision should have an end point;</seg>
<seg id="22">Data usage will be limited to Kuwait-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and uncertainty should be kept safe and protected based on evidence;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and getting to the edge;</seg>
<seg id="25">Sharing information with third parties should be defined in the law;</seg>
<seg id="26">There should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse.</seg>
<seg id="27">Meaningful participation by all "relevant stakeholders" is required, including public health experts and editorial groups. The German Disciplinary Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Seven Greens) (RSF) also published checklists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google / Apple is considering a proposed plan to solve the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when no more is needed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of the app, which eliminates the need to download the app and is capable of preventing tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all centralized systems require having centralized servers that have access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been developed that centralized servers use only for internal connections (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, the system was used without the app to perform contact tracking.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a specially designed app, the system collected tracking data from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined it to inform potentially ill individuals through short messages.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to inform potential contactless individuals, the government freed public access to location data, which has been allowed to do so due to very extensive changes in data privacy laws following the release of MERS in the country.</seg>
<seg id="36">People have access to this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries including Germany use centralized and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until 6 April 2020, no details have yet been released about this.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy protection contact tracking is an established good idea, with a sufficient part of the literature research closely tied to Hedule 2013. Until 7 April 2020, dozens of groups of experts worked on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to get the user closely inside to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and lacks a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracking of proximity privacy protection (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) and more.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these protocols, a diagnostic personal information never leaves the device, and all comparisons are done on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Privacy Group collects and uses location or way of reinforcement data when tracking the spread of COVID-19 to create SafePaths in the MIT Media Lab, which is a platform for using privacy protection techniques.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is the platform developed in March 2020 based on research published by WhatsApp titled "Apps Gun Rouge: Protecting Privacy in Wuba". Another similar effort is the creation of the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, which is a company developing privacy technologies and was originally also developed in the MIT Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses hardware safeguards technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising on the privacy of that data.</seg>
<seg id="44">On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Alliance was formed by a number of groups that joined around the same procedures and large-scale protocols aimed at reducing partition, and providing international collaboration in tracking and alert apps that are a key aspect of achieving widely used goals.</seg>
<seg id="45">On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced it had freed the BlueTrace protocol as a free source used by their official government app.</seg>
<seg id="46">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track connections, which will protect privacy by claiming they will be built based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy protection cryptographs.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the characteristics of the original technologies used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system is supposed to be implemented in three steps:</seg>
<seg id="49">Launch such tools so that states can create formal privacy protection coronavirus tracking apps.</seg>
<seg id="50">Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to first solve the problem of monitoring the system by updating the activation system and later in the same way as when the threat ended by removing the data.</seg>

<seg id="1">Washing hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning their hands to clear debris, oils, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Constantly washing hands with soap during "important moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and nausea, which are transmitted from the hands to the mouth by the substances of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="3">People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (i.e., exposed membranes).</seg>
<seg id="4">Five sensitive times a day during which washing hands with soap is important as follows: Before and after humidity relief, cleaning the following parts of the child or after changing the pumpkin, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is no water or soap, hands can also be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following situations:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before preparing food, during and after it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after patient care.</seg>
<seg id="8">After switching diapers or cleaning those babies, the need is removed.</seg>
<seg id="9">After burning the nose, cough or worms.</seg>
<seg id="10">After handling animals, pet food, or animal waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing an arm before regulating medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main health purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is particularly important for people who have access to food or work in the medical field, but also for all people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhea; reduction of respiratory diseases;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reducing infant mortality rates during childbirth in homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that refined handling habits may cause minor improvements in height growth in children under the age of five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple habitat changes, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple practice can lead to a 50% reduction in the death rate from these diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">Methods that promote hand-washing can reduce asthma cases by nearly three-quarters, and this is associated with providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if the practice is carried out automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sampling, which is a major part of ARI, is the primary cause of death among children under five years old, taking the lives of around 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of around 3.5 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to UNICEF, washing hands before and after eating and using the toilet has become its constant habit, saving the lives of more people than any vaccine or medical method, and reducing the death rate by half from diarrhea and respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Washing hands is often associated with other health care methods as part of the Water, Cleanliness and Sanitation (WASH) program.</seg>
<seg id="26">Washing hands also protects against radar that is transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only small harmful effect of hand washing is that washing the load of the hands can cause skin damage due to skin bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive washing of hands can cause irritation, a skin rash condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatititis, which is particularly common among health care professionals.</seg>
<seg id="29">Loads of hands are also known as a symptom of compulsive vascular disorders (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important in reducing the transmission of diseases from the stomach to the mouth: After using the toilet (to relieve acne or dizziness), after cleaning the following parts of the child (changing the pumpkin), before feeding the child, before and after preparing food or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Other situations where the correct hand-washing technique should be used to prevent disease transmission such as cutting or injury before and after treatment; after worm, cough and nose burning; after pet waste or pet handling; and after touching waste.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is very low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households love their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the rate in Saudi Arabia was the highest 97 percent; the average in the United States is nearly 77 percent; and the lowest in China is 23 percent. Several habitat change methods are currently available to increase the habit of handling soap at critical times. Mass handwashing for school children at selected times of the day is an option in developing countries to curb handwashing habits in children.</seg>
<seg id="34">The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the level of action to promote children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">Treating chinese twice a year, besides washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth with fluoride is the main objective of this national program.</seg>
<seg id="36">This program is also successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be enhanced by adding soap or dietary agents to the water.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main practice of soap and derivatives is to reduce obstacles in solvency, and increase solvency.</seg>
<seg id="39">Only water is not effective in cleansing the skin because oils and proteins, which are part of the organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Proper water flow only helps with cleanliness.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may protect bacteria derived from previous uses.</seg>
<seg id="42">Some of the few studies that looked at bacteria transmission from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the likelihood of this transmission is very low because bacteria are cleaned with soap foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still says "liquid soap is best for use by many individuals to control the touch of hands free".</seg>
<seg id="44">Anti-inflammatory soap is widely promoted among people with knowledge of health.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the prescriptions used on antibiotic or non- drug drugs are better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, anti-antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial substances like triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance types against organism.</seg>
<seg id="47">So if antibiotic-resistant varieties of antibiotic-resistant soap are not selected, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to the ceramic and skin-protecting substance, as a pH regulator, complex formulations like anti-microbial activated benzoic acid and other skin conditions (El Vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extraction) may contain acid acidity (acidic acid, acrylic acid, lactic acid). A verbal analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health points out that simple soap consumers grade as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from their hands.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water that is suitable for washing hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria grow faster in the body's (37 ° C) temperature.</seg>
<seg id="51">But in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular beliefs, scientific research has shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing microbial stress in the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a cleansing substance without water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, it found popularity as a cleansing substance of hand alcohol without water (also known as hands soluble with alcohol, hands soluble antiseptic, or hand sanitizer).</seg>
<seg id="55">Many depend on isopropylene alcohol or ethanol mixed with gluten in the gel such as carboomer (acrylic acid polymer), or hemocytes such as glycine in the liquid, or foam to ease use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding fluid to hydrogen peroxide glands further increases the anti-microbial activity. Hand sanitizer containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol is effective in killing antibacteria.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcoholic sanitizer bacteria, multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and kill fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Alcoholic sanitizer that contains 70% alcohol kills 99.97% of the bacteria after 30 seconds of hitting the hands (3.5 lag deficiency, equivalent to 35 doses of bacteria) and 1 minute after hitting the hands kills 99.99% of the bacteria (4 to 5 lag deficiency). The sanitizer on the hands is more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hand-alcoholic sanitizer is completely ineffective against the type of neurovirus (or norovirus) which is the main cause of infectious gastrointestinal tract. On the hands, there should be enough antiseptic or alcohol to cover both hands well.</seg>
<seg id="60">The sanitizer should be displayed for around 30 seconds on the face and back of the hands and between all the fingers until the liquid, foam or gel dry.</seg>
<seg id="61">The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a sanitizer, especially when the hands are too dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Most of these substances depend on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; but they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="63">The use of a hand-held alcoholic sanitizer bar can cause skin to bleed without having a soft or moist formula on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="64">The drying effects of alcohol skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycine and / or other soft ingredients to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, hand-held alcohol sensitizers containing soft ingredients cause less skin irritation and bleeding than soap or anti-microbial derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="66">The sensitivity of contact with dermatititis, contact with urethicaria syndrome or severe allergic reactions to alcohol or hand-shaking can occur less.</seg>
<seg id="67">The lower tendency for itching with dermatititis is significantly greater than washing hands with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">In addition to their effectiveness, the material without water does not purify the organic material from the hands, but simply counteracts the phrase.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is the reason that in preventing the spread of many pythons, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water, as pythons still remain on their hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of clean hands sanitizer from alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and historically less on alcohol and less on hand-held alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, formulas that use benzalconium chloride have shown that unlike alcohol, the microbes function more sustainably and more after use, and their effectiveness has decreased after repeated use, which may be due to continuous negative reactions on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and use ash or soil instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or soil may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Unlike soap, ash is also an anti-inflammatory substance because in conjunction with water, an alkali solvent is formed from them.</seg>
<seg id="76">The World Health Organization has proposed ero or sugars as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct technique proposed by the United States Center for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease has the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Touch your hands with hot or cold water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because standing water in the cassava may be contaminated, while water temperature does not make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="80">Cut the back of the arms, including the middle of the toes and the bottom of the nails to the hands with sufficient amounts of soap and stir.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that people want to wash their hands very well while only washing their hands with water instead of soap.</seg>
<seg id="82">Find it for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">The scalp creates a cabin, which helps to remove microbes from the skin, and for a long time the scalp removes many microbes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash it well under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">It can then be contaminated by washing hands in the cassette.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry your hands with a clean handle or hold it to an air drying machine.</seg>
<seg id="87">The bottom and middle arms can easily be contaminated. The most common remaining places of the hand are the throat, wrist, spaces between the ankles and the underside of the ankle nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and beaten nails may provide microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">Moisture lotion is often recommended to protect hands from bleeding; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmitting the disease.</seg>
<seg id="90">In developing countries, where tap water and / or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be developed to ease washing of hands, for example, draining water from crushed bushes or puddles that have proper holes and / or the use of ash if necessary. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are then water conservation solutions, such as "tap taps or crushed bushes" and other low-cost options.</seg>
<seg id="91">Tippy-tap (tippy-tap) or fallen sugar is a simple technology in which a sack is drawn with a rope, and the moving stick by the foot puts a small amount of water on the hands and there is also soap besides it.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effectively drying hands is an essential part of the hands-on hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective type of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">Large-scale research suggests that papyrus scales found in most bathrooms are much healthier than hand-drying electrical machines.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, which was financed by a paper-generating industry called the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene recommended by paper-sized, hot air handling drives and more advanced hand-held jet air drives.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing hands and drying hands with a hot air drive, the overall number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the heads of the toes and up to 254% in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="96">Drying hands with a jet air drying machine led to an average 42% increase in the number of bacteria and 15% increase in fermentation.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing hands and drying with papyrus, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the heads of the toilets and by up to 77% on the lawn. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether any drying method resulted in pollution between users of other toilets and the toilets environment.</seg>
<seg id="98">The Jet Air Dryer, which claims to extract air at speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph), is capable of flying microorganisms out of hands and unit and is likely to pollute users and toilets of other toilets up to 2 meters away.</seg>
<seg id="99">The hot air hand-drying machine spreads microorganism from the machine to 0.25 meters.</seg>
<seg id="100">No specific spread of microorganisms has been observed in the paper. In 2005, in a study conducted by TuV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="101">Following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands were observed:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many manufacturers of hand drying machine, and the hand drying machine in the field of hand drying is compared to paperwork perfection.</seg>
<seg id="103">The use of hand-cleaned flame salts is an alternative during the journey in the absence of soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">A hands-on alcoholic sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">The washing of medical hands became mandatory after a Hungarian doctor named Agnes Simelius found the washing of hands effective in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.</seg>
<seg id="107">A study found that infection rates decreased using them.</seg>
<seg id="108">The medical handling method is for at least 15 seconds, and enough soap and water or gel should be used to squeeze and all parts of the hands should be disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands should be shaken with both hands inserting fingers into each other.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is tentacles under the finger nodes, then a brush should be used to remove them.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes may remain on their hands in water, it is important that the hands are cleaned well and dry clean with perfection.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, paperwork perfection should be used to block water (and if necessary, the exit door can also be opened with paper).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents the recycling of hands from those places.</seg>
<seg id="114">The goal of washing hands in a health care center is to eliminate pyrogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent them from transmitting.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Medical Journal puts that the rate of not washing hands in most medical environments is at an unacceptable level, with many doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, and thus carrying microbes.</seg>
<seg id="116">A study has shown that washing hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheteria-related blood flow diseases by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standard methods of handling and handling in health care sectors.</seg>
<seg id="117">A hands-on hygiene guide designed by the organization is also published on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">This related review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="119">Commercial tools can measure and verify hands-on hygiene, if required to prove compliance with regulations.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to the World Health Organization, hands should be washed in the following "five situations":</seg>
<seg id="121">After contact with blood / body fluid</seg>
<seg id="122">Before performing anti-inflammatory work, and</seg>
<seg id="123">After patient treatment. Adding anti-inflammatory chemicals in soap ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) gives the strength of killing the hand washing substance.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such a practice of killing microbes may be required before undergoing surgery or at medical centers where the possibility of spreading antibiotic-resistant organisms is greatly increased. For surgical operations, it is necessary to clear someone's hands so that there is a pipe that runs and stops without touching hands, some chloroxidine or washing iodine should also be available, alongside a healthy scent for drying hands after washing, a healthy brush for shaking and a healthy tool for cleaning the underneath the nails of the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">According to this method, the hands should be washed for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">Shaking hands for longer periods (10 minutes) is not necessarily necessary.</seg>
<seg id="128">When pouring water, it should be prevented from drinking water towards the hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the washing of the hands is completed, the hands should be dried with a healthy toe, and the surgical clothes should be worn.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use anti-inflammatory substances before and after the treatment of a patient.</seg>
<seg id="131">It has been found to control staphylococcal disease in hospitals that the biggest benefit of hand-washing has come from the initial 20% washing and the additional benefit from less was achieved when repeated hand-washing increased by 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Washing hands with simple soap causes three times more transmission of bacteria infectious diseases to food than washing them with anti-microbial soap. Beating alcohol soluble on hands for an average of 30 seconds compared to washing hands with anti-microbial soap showed that hand-shaped alcohol content reduces the pollution of microbes by 26% more than anti-microbial soaps.</seg>
<seg id="133">But soap and water are more effective than hand-washing alcoholic substances to reduce the H1N1 influenza A virus and cholesterol defibrillation spores. Hands-on hygiene at health care centers can be improved in ways that give employees an understanding of hand-washing, increase the availability of hand-wrapped alcohol substances, and provide written and literary reminders to employees.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed to determine which methods are most effective in different health care centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is known as a low-cost and compulsory tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and places of work has led to the challenge that washing hands can become a universal general habit.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, hand washing tubes near private or public toilets in many rural areas of Africa are very rare, while there are cheaper options to make hand-washing spaces.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, low levels of washing hands can be a result of poorly constructed habitat compared to lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">The promotion and support of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to a change in people's long-term habits.</seg>
<seg id="140">To ensure this work is effective, monitoring and evaluating is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based behavior is effective in increasing the habit of handling in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of hands-on promotion in schools is a "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that pupils love their hands with soap among other healthy desires.</seg>
<seg id="142">When adjustment criteria are achieved, schools can move from one star to three stars eventually.</seg>
<seg id="143">The creation of hand washing sites can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="144">World Handling Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign to achieve the goal of habitat change. As a result of the spread of the 2019-20 coronavirus virus, UNICEF promoted the selection of hand-washing emoji.</seg>
<seg id="145">A couple of studies have considered the overall impact of the cost of handling related to DALYs prevention in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, a review suggested that the extension of hand washing with soap is more evaluated than other methods of water and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as mothers who have recently given birth in hospitals or injured soldiers - was first recognized by two leading doctors of hand hygiene in the middle of the 19th century: Dr. Agnes Simelius of Hungary who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nantagel, who was English and is the founder of "Modern Nursing."</seg>
<seg id="148">Many people at that time believed that this infection was caused by the odd viruses called mosquitoes.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, diseases caused by food and health care related infections forced the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hands-on hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">Pig influenza disease in 2009 and the outbreak of Coved-19 in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, posters called "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung in German public bathrooms and office buildings and airports near the bathrooms.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "wash your hands" from one thing means that someone expresses discomfort by assuming responsibility for that or shares himself in this crime.</seg>
<seg id="153">The text originates from the Bible message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate wrapped his hands from the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used phrase in English societies.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's dissertation, Ms. McBath compulsively moves her hands in an attempt to clear the imaginary stain seen in her body, representing her sinful conscience over the crimes committed by her and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="155">It has also been found that people, after remembering or condemning unethical acts, are often forced to wash their hands more often than others, and give more value to hand-washing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other compulsory "cleaning" tasks, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religions also offer hand-washing for healthy and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, namely the use of water to wash hands without soap, is part of the idea of hand-washing in many religions such as the Bahraini faith, Hinduism, television and the Natural Memorial in Judaism, Luke in Christianity, and the Holy Spirit in Islam. Religions typically also recommend washing a healthy hand after certain practices.</seg>
<seg id="158">After using the bathroom, Hinduism, Judaism and Islam order the washing of hands.</seg>
<seg id="159">And Hinduism, Buddhism, secularism, Judaism and Islam order handshakes before and after eating all the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The spread of Krona virus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Krona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and infected more than 80,000 of them. This is a disaster for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to this Homolecular virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may spread through evening showers and develop a similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 is less severe and deadly than SARS but is more prevalent and affects younger persons and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid number of publications with a debilitating illness, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing topic of research.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will cover the basics of disease prevention, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction, and disease prevention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although many questions still require answers, we hope this review helps to understand and eliminate threatening diseases.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 2020 January 25 Spring Festival has become a unique and unforgettable destination for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors for the entire holidays and many weeks due to the spread of the new disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is highly commonplace for the krona virus (CoV) which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11,2020, and the related disease was named CoV infection -19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The disease began in Wuhan city of China and quickly spread throughout the country and around 50 other countries worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 22,2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">Who warns that COVID-19 is a "Grade 1 enemy of the people" and is potentially more potent than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https: / / www. Ncbie. Niho. Gov / pubmed), more than 200 copies of COVID-19 have been published in less than two months including its viral epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. The first report since January 7 2020 determined that the virus sequence had been isolated from many patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in a new and faster growing case area.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some endless urgent questions we have learned so far.</seg>
<seg id="16">Covs are traditionally known to humans as non-fatal diseases, usually causing 4% of normal colds.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human covs, for example, SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, which actually caused the spread in China in the first SARS 2003 and then in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread this disease and death to many other countries with fear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, current COVID-19 is the third widespread CoV incident in the recorded history of humans / humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">As demonstrated in 1,111 form, a cluster of chest bugs with an unknown source were first reported from Wuhan on December 31,2019, to the National Health Commission of China.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven (7) days later the CoV sequence was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan city on January 15,2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the disease quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, infections from health care providers were reported, suggesting that transmission from human to human was possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, Wuhan City was closed to all public transport.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered an area of disease starting from an unidentified animal source.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, WHO declared it a global health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of this report, the disease had already spread in China and had also spread to more than 50 other countries around the world. (Figure 2) 2.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the situation develops rapidly, the final tread and intensity of expansion will be further determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11,2020, a multi-center study on 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients including 8,866 patients presented a new update of the disease as follows (https: / / mph. Weixinn. Qq. Com / s / ULBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">Premature SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but most are over 30-65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="31">Around half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years old, a very small number were under 20 years old, and only 14% of patients infected were under 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 has affected more males (0.27 / 100,000) than females (0.31 / 100.000).</seg>
<seg id="33">CoVID-19 was originally spread out in clusters in and around Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average duration of pollution was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The initial ratio number (R0) was 3.77 (% 95 CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased drastically before Jan. 23,2020, compared with the time of major transmission before the Spring Festival in China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The death toll of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (% 95 CI: 1.10-1.86), and the death toll of all patients was 3.06% (% 59.4-02.2: CI 95%).</seg>
<seg id="40">Three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (PH7-60), and severe chest bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="41">Covs are a subset of large and covered viruses that have an emotional RNA unit.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four species, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">Spark Pocket (S) glycprotein is associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively for this cell receptors injectable conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) and deeptidal peptides 4 (DPP4), and subsequently fusion occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Viral RNA genome is spread in cytoplasm; after replicating the virus genome, genomic RNA forms varicose vibrations with lymphatic glucose proteins and nucleotoxic proteins, which then position the virus to release along the plasma membrane.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is reported on 10 January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">SARS-CoV-2 was found as a new type of beta CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% among 10 sequenced samples collected from the Huawei seafood market in Wuhan, the main area of the expansion.</seg>
<seg id="47">SARS-CoV-2 is virtually identical to SARS-CoV compared to MAR-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Through microscopy of transmission bacteria, particles of SARS - CoV - 2 were found in ultrasound parts of the human airborne epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">Human ACE2 was found to be the recipient for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much weaker than SARS-CoV associated with human ACE2, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also make nasal short proteins that are spread by orf3b and discharged by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogen capability and infect the case of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known active domain or shape.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18,2020, Zhou, Eat All, a full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM structure in a complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1 reported.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex, which has open and closed conditions, is assembled as a dimer and a mixture of ACE2-B0AT1 can bind to two S proteins, which provide evidence for identifying and infecting CoV.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may become a treatment target for a drug test to offset SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Source and Intermediate Hosting</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening showers and were transferred to humans through cats and tears respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through philosophical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other covs, evening shows were the main host of SARS-CoV-2 because 96% of the new virus is similar to the two SARS covs known as -SL-CoVZX45. Bat - SL-CoVZX21</seg>
<seg id="59">However, what has helped the medium-sized host virus to overcome the species' obstacles to infecting humans, and its path of transmission remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="60">G. I., Maran presented the virus as a virus carrier to humans from evening showers that involved the molecular mass within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that penguins - long mouthwash, mouthwash mouthwash mouthwash mouthwash mouthwash often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a potential medium-term host of SARS-CoV-2 in CoV based on 99% of the genetic mouthwash found in penguins and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the spread of 1% variation in two genomes is still a big difference; thus, awaiting the results of true and accurate evidence (shape. 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still not widely known.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and stay under 20 ° C and 40% humidity for up to 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, chlorine containing, anti-inflammatory, parasitic acid, chlorofluorocarbons and other fat solvents, but chloroxidine cannot effectively deactivate this virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">The entire human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this nasal virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, no detailed research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other covs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure. (Figure 4) 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">Typically, after the virus attacks the host, it is first identified by the host domestic immune system through sample identification recipients (PRRs), including C-type lactin-like recipients, all-type recipient TLR (NOD) recipients (NLR), and - (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">In various ways, the virus encourages a combination of inflammatory factors, the completion of dermal cells, and type I interventions (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the microphilosophy of viral antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape from immune reactions.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, an immune adaptive response joins in the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T4 lymphosphates play an important role in the defense of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells encourage B cells to produce specific antibodies of the virus, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">T auxiliary cells produce protein flammable cytokines to help defense cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can prevent T cell functions by stimulating T cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nerve immunity supplements like C3a and C5a and antibodies are also needed against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, a healthy patient's antibodies replace the MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, doing too much of the immune system locally creates large radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other nerves, and, in the worst case, cause multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SARS-CoV-2 mutation, initiated with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">It is common that for people who are infected with a large number of viruses or have their immune functions compromised, they have a greater chance of getting infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">The estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of which are 3-7 days based on the first study of 425 cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study on 1,099 cases showed that the duration of contraction was an average of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is very important for health authorities to regulate the effective time of contraction based on the rule, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but unsymptoms to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected to this disease are usually required to be vigilant for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the conviction period be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is often the major and early symptoms of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, pain of organs / nerves, headache, headache, difficulty, rashes, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea / vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experienced dyspnea and / or hypoxemia a week after the disease began.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, patients developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acids, and coagulipathy rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with tuberculosis and / or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without abnormal lung impairments, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spina, and 3% for diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters caused by transplants from a non-muscle patient.</seg>
<seg id="95">Relatively, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dysfunction (55%) were their main symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and correspond to higher mERS deaths compared to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and chronic pain (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">In SARS patients, it was identified that fever (99% - 100), dry cough (29% - 75%), diarrhea (40% - 42), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13%) -25) were major symptoms and nearly 14--% of patients were 20. Fresh air was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, the COVID-19 death toll was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.</seg>
<seg id="100">Relatively, the SARS death toll in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, death was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47% with a 5.71-7.23% 95 interval (CI), while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4%.</seg>
<seg id="103">Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with their symptoms, deaths, and R0 were presented in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher prevalence rate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, SARS-CoV-2 disease control is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster starts often occur in the same family or similar meetings or vehicles as cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often have a travel or residence history in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients two weeks before contact.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without cause for more than two weeks and hospitalized discharged patients can re-transmit the virus, which sends a zinger to increase convulsion time.</seg>
<seg id="109">Patients have normal or low numbers of white blood cells (especially lymphs) at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, the number of white blood cells &lt; 4 × 109 / L with lymphosphenia was found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphosphate number 1 × 109 / L, and high peripheral immunotransmitter levels and varamia.</seg>
<seg id="111">Levels of liver / blood and muscle enzymes and maggot increased in the blood of liver patients, and C- reaction protein and progesterone fermentation increased in the blood of many patients.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, which are a product of fibrous degeneration in the blood, have increased, and the number of lymphomas has gradually decreased.</seg>
<seg id="113">Abnormalities in breast radiation were found in most COVID-19 patients and in the lungs were impaired by two-dimensional patchy shadows or ground glass.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop epilepsy, severe lung injury, and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, irregular controlled swelling, fluid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis damage the gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Typhoid I and typhoid II pattern disorders reduce fertilizer levels and increase surface pressure, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Therefore, the radiographic findings of bad breasts often align with the extreme extent of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18,2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 showed the influence of cinomatoes, hyalene membrane formation, and interstellar lymphosphate, and several diseased cinnamon cells in the patient's lungs that died due to the disease, according to pathologists. The viral infection was similar to ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as major criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, due to high error - negative rates, which may accelerate the disease, clinical expressions used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13,2020.</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar condition also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining disease history, clinical expressions, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is necessary for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14,2020, Feng Jiang's group outlined a protocol using the CRISPR based SHERLOCK technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA spots in 20 × 10-18 Mole / L from 200. -18 10-18 Mole / L (10-100 copies per microwave of the internet) without using a desktop in less than an hour without requiring an explanatory device.</seg>
<seg id="124">Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically improve sensitivity and ease if certified in clinical samples.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to lack of experience with Nasa CoV, therapists can provide support care to COVID-19 patients while attempting various treatments that have already been used or prescribed for other covs therapies such as SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV and other viral infections (table (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These medicines include current and potential treatments for antiretroviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support from acquired patients.</seg>
<seg id="127">Even plasma from the recovered patients was prescribed to be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs in the first place and may also attack, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the stomach system and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, respiratory illness and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, respiratory support is important for reducing symptoms and saving lives and this includes general oxygen treatment, high flow oxygen, deficient ventilation, and the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with oxygen (ECMO), a heart fixing technique used to treat a life-threatening heart and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, electrical balance protection, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It has been recognized that cytokine storms result from excessive activity of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storms are part of a systematic inflammatory response spread by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNPTFE, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines encourage the immune cells to release many free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and nerve failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunity is necessary to treat cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and toselizomes, an antibody of IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immune therapies for cytokine storms include manual immune response adjustment by T cell; IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling bridge 4 and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids, as an immune force, have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids at higher doses were not useful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">Instead, they may cause serious side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids ranging from low to medium range were recommended to use COVID-19 carefully for serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="144">Until the time of writing, no effective antiretroviral treatment has been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, vessels administered with rheumatoid, a nucleotide inhaler, were found to be effective with COVID-19 in an American patient.</seg>
<seg id="146">Ramadsar is a novel antiretroviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlboro viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, the recall also showed possible exposure to other single-infected RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on this, Gilead has provided the center to China to conduct this pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.</seg>
<seg id="149">Additionally, Barryosynthesis, antiretroviral α, Lupinavir / Ritonavir and ribavirin were presented as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhea, inflammation, vomiting, liver damage, and other negative reactions can occur after joint treatment with loophole / retonavirus.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interactions of these medicines with other drugs used for patients should be investigated thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma is used to treat obese patients and antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="153">Blood collection from patients who have come from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or have a long history of protecting healthy individuals from preventable diseases.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, healthy patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immune force created by B lemphosphates to fight diseases and other external objects and know specific molecules in such diseases and directly affect them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this, plasma came from the blood of a group of patients who were healed from COVID-19 and were treated in 10 serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms grew within 24 hours, with decreases in inflammation and viral strains and the growth of oxygen synthesis in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, confirmation and explanations are required before specific treatments are yet developed to offer a method for large-scale use.</seg>
<seg id="159">Additionally, given the therapeutic effects, some of the damage associated with plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can promote immune reactions and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening poison.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large enough to treat serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">Rapid production of special antibodies to fight against global disease is extremely expensive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is very serious and practical to separate B cells from patient cells and to identify effective antibodies or immune codes against virus essential proteins.</seg>
<seg id="164">Thus, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">TCM has been used to treat a range of diseases in China for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effects largely rely on a combination of many parts in the formula based on TCM theories related to diagnosis of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="167">Many effective components remain unknown or vague because it is difficult to extract and verify the same ingredients or their favorite recipes.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative therapies for patients with moderate to light symptoms or for those who have returned from severe stages.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, the capsule of Shen Feng Xie Du Capsule and Lean Ho Kang Wen capsule were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="170">Preferential treatment rates in COVID-19 patients were considered in several Chinese provinces that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Nanjing (50%), and Hainan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in just 30% of its COVID-19 patients had the lowest treatment rate (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is somewhat relatively comparable because many other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18,2020, Billy Jong and colleagues published a study to compare WM and TCM combined therapies with Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time required to regenerate body temperature, symptoms, and hospital bed was much shorter than in the WM + TCM group alone.</seg>
<seg id="174">More effectively, the symptoms worse (serious than light) were significantly lower for the WM + TCM group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality was only lower in the WM + TCM group compared to WM. Group (8.8% compared to 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaited in well-controlled trials at major tracks and other facilities.</seg>
<seg id="176">It will be noteworthy to determine the mechanism of action and determine the effective parts of TCM therapy or their combinations if possible.</seg>
<seg id="177">Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and vulnerable people also experience fatigue, alone, nausea and anger.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of diseases such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and adverse side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by cardiovascular diseases can cause a lot of anxiety and psychological suffering.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the first phase of SARS infection, a series of mental illnesses including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental illness joints, mental symptoms, nausea, and even suicide were reported.</seg>
<seg id="180">Essential contact tracking and convulsions, as part of public health reactions to COVID-19 infection, can make people more concerned and confused about the effects of infectious diseases, convulsions, and malnutrition on family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the creation of multinational psychological health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are needed to interfere with the range of transmission from animal stocks and infected humans to infected habitats and are often supplemented with anti- viral therapies to control the disease caused by established viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Efforts have been launched to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and potent non-genetic antibodies and / or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lifesaving vaccines were assessed in animal models for SARS.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in older persons and fatal challenge models and their protection against the deadly zoonotic virus were still defined before clinical studies began.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is probably because SARS was removed 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, cases and clusters of MERS occur in the Middle East and also spread to other regions that continue to source zonotic in unusual regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies were developed for mers using passive viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nano-partisans, virus-like particles and reproductive protein subunits and some were evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized persons is an urgent and serious task to control the ongoing outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, it is challenging to overcome problems because of the long time required for vaccine development and covs dynamic changes (on average 18 months).</seg>
<seg id="192">As an incurable disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its full clinical course across thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually become healthy without a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher infection and death in seriously ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-conscious areas.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or influence the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor for diagnosing SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">CoVID-19 is commonly developed in 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients ages 8,866 cases above 50 in the study.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who needed in-depth care had a lot of potential disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those who weren't aged 66 - 51 compared to the average age of years, which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: SARS - CoV - 2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 compared to 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Disorders and disorders: CoVID-19 patients who require in-depth care are more likely to have severe heart disease and arthritis.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiovascular events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be bound to ACE2 - positive cholangiosis, which may cause blood / liver loss in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth mentioning that age and real diseases are strongly related and may interfere with each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Unusual laboratory findings: C- reaction protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of swelling or tissue injuries and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, reaction to treatment, and ultimate recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">CRV level communication is also recommended with COVID-19 intensity and diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="207">Additionally, elevated lactate de hydrogenase (LDH), acupuncture immunotransmitters (AST), Allen immunotransmitters (ALT), and Cretin Keynes (CK) may also contribute to the prediction of results.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and blood / liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Thus, these are traditional symptoms for disabling the heart or liver.</seg>
<seg id="210">Major clinical signs: The temporary development of breast radiation and clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues for the prediction and complexity of COVID-19 results.</seg>
<seg id="211">Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immune diseases used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">Since high amounts of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from isolated osteoarthritis with disability and poor quality of life throughout their lives.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used on a low dose and in COVID-19 patients for a short time.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress during COVID-19 disease because they often suffer from asthma and chronic uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and friends.</seg>
<seg id="215">It is mandatory to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress to a healthy and normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">So far, according to demographic studies, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in low respiration, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively trigger a reaction in the upper respiratory tract and develop moderate or symptoms during the first stage of infection, similar to other covs that cause normal colds.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, patients infected during the first phase or the incubation period can develop large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the disease.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, while most transmission does not occur during the first phase.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">Currently, major efforts are underway in China, including the continuous SARS-CoV-2 transmission route of Wuhan and surrounding cities and nearly the entire population.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these practices dramatically damage the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the burden of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the pullback will last through March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, other experts are not so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter, Ill., has predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Evra Langini, and others, developed an example to predict the outcome of the disease and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in both the medium turbine and throat penalties of patients who were hospitalized 2 weeks ago and hospitalized, indicating that the newly identified virus can trigger a cyclone like influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that the current strategy may work.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half a million deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through severe convulsions and isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">It is possible, unlike SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become implicated in infection and eventually die or remain shared with humans with the less pathogenic virus.</seg>
<seg id="232">Comparing COVID-19 disease with SVS and mers is the following prepared form (shapes. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through cough or vomiting, and may be contaminated with the virus through direct contact.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus was also found in human targets, which raises the possibility of a new mouth transplant through the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were potentially caused by non-infectious diseases, including 17 other patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="236">Thus, it should be carefully protected by humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even in contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing a face mask; both use a surgical mask and N95 respiratory mask (Series # 1860s) to help control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">A surgical face mask prevents the potentially infected vessel's liquid droplets from traveling through the air or entering the surface of the material, where it can be transferred to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only the N95 (Series # 1860s) mask can protect against the inhalation of smaller viruses from 10 to 80 mg, only 5% of viruses are fully capable of penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are around 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks together, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health care providers must wear fibrous enzymes to further reduce contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also make a person sick through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22,2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Thus, health care providers also must wear a transparent face coat or scarf while working with patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to protect themselves and limit contact with potential patients.</seg>
<seg id="246">Staying away from the patient at three steps / steps is considered the right distance for people.</seg>
<seg id="247">These practices are effective methods that reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 has come to the human world as a new virus, its superior hotline to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7 2020 should have caused China to be on high alert due to its deep memory over the spread of SARS in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, not until January 2020, the director of disease control in Wuhan assures citizens that the novel virus has a low infectious and limited proportion from human to human and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.</seg>
<seg id="250">This message calmly reduced the division of the population, especially when the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and lost an important time to prevent this disease in Wuhan at least.</seg>
<seg id="251">Disease control agencies in China may take a hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because each word is valuable to the public and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reflective to extraordinary information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) initially more restrictive to having a potential illness rather than giving comfort to the public. And (4) more often publishes targeted and effective advice to raise awareness of infectious diseases and to temporarily examine and optimize the community response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 disease was caused by the nasal virus SARS-CoV-2 which began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, at the time of writing this disease spread in China and around 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and its symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a feeling of repeating SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are mandatory for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">CoVID-19 affects older individuals and more men than younger women, and severity and mortality rates are also higher in older individuals than younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="258">SARS has a higher death toll than COVID-19 (1.44% compared to 10.91%).</seg>
<seg id="259">COVID-19 patients carry the virus even when they have symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which causes a greater difficulty in spreading COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">Part of this explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Regular RNA Assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, medicated patients may still be positive for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues are still being addressed, including the types below:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% of genetic hooligans were found between covs like SARS-CoV-2 and two shopper SARS, we still can't reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is from shopkeepers.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal was the average animal that carries the virus from the original host to the human?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers of numbers 1 and 2, we can't effectively mitigate the transition, and these incidents can be resurfaced at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular modeling and biochemical writing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how exactly does the virus penetrate into airborne cells and later make pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also connected to ACE2 expression cells in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">What will this disease last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does this virus genetically develop during transmission between humans?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it be pulled out worldwide, die like SARS or come out like a pneumonia at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="275">This is mandatory but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, with whatever cost it can afford, we have no other option but to immediately stop the outbreak and bring our lives back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothesis vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019.</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no clinical trials on any vaccine have been completed, much effort is underway to develop such a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="3">In February 2020, the World Health Organization said that the organization does not expect to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a related or common virus, in less than 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April there were five vaccine candidates in the Fiz I safety probe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Covid-19 was introduced in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">Disease worldwide spread highly in 2020, resulting in significant investment in the development of a vaccine and research activity.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations use the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As demonstrated in April, the essential aspects of CEPI's initiative to develop a vaccine include acceleration, building capacity, providing a certain amount of information, and universal access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, scientists reported that in early 2020 10 different technology explorations were under investigation and development to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">The major audit targets that have been developed in the Fiz I safety investigation include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (First Fat Progress and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, M. RNA -1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral Vector (First Fat Progress and Vaccine Candidate: Canine Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">As reported by CPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 others have been announced but with little public information available (considered to be under plan or as designed).</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fiz I-II test, which is conducted in the first test of safety and immunogenesis, is generally randomized, plasma controlled, and performed at various sites / locations, while also a highly accurate and effective dosage / medicine selector.</seg>
<seg id="15">The participants include a control group, the effectiveness of a vaccine test to prevent the disease, while monitoring side effects in hopeful doses / medicines.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates in the active development phase approved since early April 2020, 74 of them have not been tested in human evaluation (still in pre-clinical research stages).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around 24 April 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that the university is investigating the possibility of a molecular nucleus vaccine that intentionally causes a change in viral proteins to trigger an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced the start of work on a vaccine, which aims to begin human testing in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vaccine development projects were announced on 26 January 2020 at the China Disease Control and Prevention Center, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around 29 January 2020, Johnson Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hank Scottmaker, announced that these companies have started working on developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Johnson, with the help of his biotechnology partner, creates a vaccine through the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 18 March 2020, Emerging Biosolution announced a productive partnership with Vaccaro to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="23">On 8 February 2020, the Incogen lab in Romania spoke to a research article about the design / design of a vaccine with an evenly used technology for the treatment of nucleotigene vaccination of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 25 March, the research institute announced that they had concluded the combination of the vaccine and started testing it.</seg>
<seg id="25">On 27 February 2020, Genetic Subsidiary Company, Ngenetics immuno-oncology, announced that they had launched a vaccination project to develop a lethal peptide vaccine against Coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="26">They want to produce an amyotrophic vaccine that can be tested on humans within 90 days.</seg>
<seg id="27">On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced a vaccination project.</seg>
<seg id="28">On 5 March 2020, both the U. S. Army Medical Research and Technical Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Springs in West Maryland announced they were working on a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">Around 10 March 2020, Emerging Bioscience announced that they were partnering with Novax Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Combined with the development and production of vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="34">The Amsterdam vaccine is a laboratory study alongside human tests planned in July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, The Guardian newspaper reported that US President Donald Trump had given Kwik more money for wider access to the Coved-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.</seg>
<seg id="36">On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German biotech company to develop an M. R. N. A. -based vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">The M. R. N. A. -based amyloid vaccine BNT162, which is currently undergoing clinical pre-examination, begins its clinical trials in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Italy on 17 March 2020, Taikos Biotech, an Italian company, announced that they will receive the results of the test before the clinic in April 2020 and will launch the versatile amphibious vaccine in human trials in the autumn / fall.</seg>
<seg id="39">On 19 March 2020, the Fifth Alliance of WHO Providers in France announced a $4.9 million investment for the Coved-19 Vaccine Research Alliance. The alliance includes Institute Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh with a total CPI investment of $29 million to develop the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other CEPI investment partners to develop the Covid-19 vaccine are Modena, Kauruk, Inova, Novix, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different amphibious vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers from Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a RNA vaccine for Coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Amsterdam vaccine was developed from China within 14 days of receiving the string.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Canadian government announced 96 research projects financing 275 million Canadian dollars on a number of ambitious anti-vaccination measures at Canadian companies and universities like the University of Madico and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="45">At the same time, the Canadian government announced a special 192 million Canadian dollar grant to develop the Coved-19 vaccine. It also includes plans to create a "vaccination bank" of various new vaccines to be used to spread / trigger another form of the coronavirus virus.</seg>
<seg id="46">On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the pituitary test. This is a possible vaccine of Covid-19 in mice. The report stated that, "MNA presented second-rate vaccines of SARS-Covid-2 is1 that stimulated specific antibiotic reactions to antigen [in mice] that appeared within 2 weeks after immunity."</seg>
<seg id="47">In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's pharmacy school announced the design of an ambitious DNA vaccine as a possible nose spray.</seg>

<seg id="49">In March 2020, the U. S. government, industry, and three universities, including Hewlett-Packard Interactive, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, combined and shared their resources to acquire supercomputers from eBay.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as unspecified side effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they can have other benefits besides preventing disease.</seg>
<seg id="52">In Australia, it wants to hire 4170 health care professionals for the following random tests.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is possible that the vaccine is not safe and effective while developing.</seg>
<seg id="54">The first research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using coved-19 related animal models, such as AI 2-transgenic mice, animals from other laboratories, and nonhuman animals, requires 3rd level biological safety measures and international coordination to ensure the effectiveness of vaccines using live viruses.</seg>
<seg id="55">The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in nonhuman or animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">Until 2020, no SARS therapy or safety vaccine has been developed to prove it is safe and effective for humans as well.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the introduction and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against SARS.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme connected to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 prevents the activity of injectable enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of injectins II and increasing antig (1-7), and thus becomes a promising drug for the treatment of heart diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injectable conversion enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, which has a metallic enzyme and settles on the surface of endothelial and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein consists of the N -terminal peptides M2 domain and the C terminal clinical renal amino acid transmitter domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single aggressive I type membrane protein, which has an enzymically active domain, and appears on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The outer domain of ACE2 is separated from the trans mammalian domain by another enzyme known as shadows, and the last soluble protein spreads in the bloodstream and is eventually extracted through cognition or mutations.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is connected to the main lung II type flu cells in most organs, small intestinal infections, arteries and veins endothelial cells and flat muscle cells of the artery.</seg>
<seg id="9">The appearance of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stereotype, hippocampus, and brain stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="10">The primary task of ACE2 is to act as a balancing force for ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ace virologist Angiotensin II separates the hormone in Angiotensin II.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxyl terminal amino acid fenylaline from the engineutensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and turns it into viscellular engineutensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also separate a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - Bridkin, epilepsy, neurotension, dinorphine A, and germination.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates membranes that are inflammatory amino acid transmitters SLC6A19 and are infected with hortenp.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a trans macular protein, ACE2 acts as the main place for certain coronaviruses to enter cells, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Specifically, closing the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spark S1 proteins on the surface of cells with the ACE2 enzymic domain causes endocytes and transmission of both viruses and enzymes that settle in cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the preparation of S proteins by host serene proteins TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential therapy for this exposure. This has led some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight the disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, many professional associations and regulatory agencies have proposed continuing standard ACE control and ARB treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11,2012 found that "the use of ACE controllers was associated with a significant 34% reduction in pattern risk compared to controls."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, "the risk of sampling" was also reduced in patients who were treated with ACE masters who were at higher risk of sampling, especially those who had brain stroke and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE skulls was also associated with a reduction in sample-related deaths, although the results were slightly stronger than the overall risk of sampling.</seg>
<seg id="22">The human combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is regarded as a new treatment for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulsed hemodynamics and oxygen appetite in the joints with the paralyzed severe acute respiratory syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="23">Half the age of rhACE2 in humans is around 10 hours and the start of action for 24 hours in addition to the effect (duration) is 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a hopeful drug for those who do not tolerate classic rhACE2 - injectable system seizures (RAS seizures) or in diseases where injectable II is elevated. The implantation of rhACE2 to treat acute respiratory syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019 - 20 Coronavirus outbreak is the continuation of the outbreak of the coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV), a severe respiratory disease spread by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The introduction of this expedition was held in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, and on December thirteenth, due to international concerns, the Lower Helmet Embassy was installed in the country, and on March 11,2020, the date of the Olympic expedition was reopened.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a measure dated April 10,2020, 1.60 million stories of krona virus were reported in 210 countries, leading to the deaths of more than 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Back then 364,000 people were healed from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="5">The death rate was recorded at 4% in China, and 13.04% worldwide in Algeria, .08% in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">General symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="7">Serious and complex symptoms of the disease include chest bleeding, various symptoms of respiratory system blockage, and activation of many organs of the body resulting in weakness or death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The symptoms of this disaster generally appear in five days, but in some stories it takes two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the new corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The symptoms of the first symptoms are the benefit of losing this patient and helping him, renewed precautionary measures are important, such as washing hands, taking something to the mouth during a cough, keeping a distance with each other, and separating suspects from themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Internationally, authorities enforce travel bans, quarantine, tourism, local danger control laws.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to poverty, severe wage and economic disruption have occurred in the world, there has been a widespread reduction in the transfer of fear of taking part in games, religious, political and cultural events.</seg>
<seg id="13">Universities and macabana were closed on a national or local basis in all 193countries of the world, which has affected around 99.4 percent of students worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Online references to the virus were shared with false information, and there have been incidents of animosity and discrimination against Chinese people, including east and south-east Asian breeding people, and significant areas of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon-emission due to the reduction of travel means and the ban on large labour.</seg>
<seg id="16">As of December 31,2019, an unknown epidemiological case of sanomonia was reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vast majority of cases are linked to the seafood of Hawaians and it is said that the origin of the virus is zonetic.</seg>
<seg id="18">Known as SARS-CoV, the newly discovered virus is closely related to the shocking coronavirus virus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person to be infected on 1December 2019 had no contact with this vet market.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the first reported incidents in December 2019, two-thirds of people were found to have links to the market.</seg>
<seg id="20">No confirmed report in China 13th March 2020 South China Mercury Post reported that HIV / AIDS had occurred in 55th century on 17th November 2019, reported a decrease in vaccination incidents in 26 February 2020 Dubai and China, but there has been an increase in incidents in Italy, Iran and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="21">Reporting cases may be very rare, especially in cases with minor symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fewer than 26% of cases were reported in adolescents aged 19 and younger, compared to 2.4% worldwide, UK outbreak scientific consultant Patrick Vance credited that 60% of England's waterborne diseases should be immunized prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of incidents is indicative of people who have been tested for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of 23 March, a country did not test 3% of its population, it was often the policy of countries that would not test the literature of symptoms, such as Athens, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a study published on March 16, it was said that as of 23 January, a measure of 86% COVID-19 disease cases had not been found and that this last cognitive infection was the source for 79% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the analysis of its data published on March 30th, the number of people infected with coronavirus in Italy is much higher than it was reported.</seg>
<seg id="27">The underlying production figure for COVID-19 is RO (1.40) to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most people are hospitalized from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="30">The practice of developing symptoms until death is 6 to 41 days, and for most common people this is 14days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97.000 billion deaths were caused by Coved-19 flooding.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, up to February 5, 80% of the deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of those already had cardiovascular disease, usually "formally COVID-19 vaccinated deaths from it" protocol for testing positive.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is possible that COVID-19 is actually due to an increase in the number of people who have died, for example in houses or nursing homes and other places.</seg>
<seg id="34">Preliminary data from Italy show that the number of official deaths due to COVID-19 is more than 5x-4.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesperson for the U. S. Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that (the number of people dying) was shown to be low, with an anecdotal report previously confirmed as less sensitive, such as H1N1 Swine flu outbreak in 2009. The first confirmed death was in Po Wuhan city on January 9,2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first deaths outside the Chinese mainland were in the Philippines on February 1, and the first deaths outside Asia came on February 14 in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">28 February outside the central land of China, dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of March 13,40 more countries and regions and every continent other than Antarctica have reported deaths, more general measures have been taken to measure deaths.</seg>
<seg id="39">These numbers change over time and time, and the volume of tests, quality of health care, treatment warnings, time after the first incident and is influenced by population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health, reflects the proportion of deaths divided into the number of diagnosed incidents during the given time period.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of death worldwide is 6.0% in the year to April 10,2020.</seg>
<seg id="41">This number varies depending on the area.</seg>
<seg id="42">The proportion of deaths in China stood at 17.3% (in which it symptoms 1 to 10 January 2020), a sharp decrease of 0.7% (which came after 1 February, 2020). Other steps include the incident death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease, and the incidence rate of the disease (IFR), which indicates the percentage of people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">These precautions do not have a time limit and are prevented from pursuing a solution.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some academic institutions have tried to use these data for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Oxford University Centre has measured evidence based on evidence that the disease rate for vaping is 0.1% to 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The highest rate of this range in Germany is frequently diagnosed with COVID-19, and a statin study measures diagnosis as effective as CFR.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the outbreak can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The increasing number and time of illness is uncertain and the place is fairly different.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni of Penn State University says that the disease of unchecked infection generally begins to ferret out and then decrease when the disease passes through the existing host.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is not possible to predict what kind of intelligence it will be now.</seg>
<seg id="51">The Chinese government's chief medical adviser Zhong Nashan argues that this will be terminated until June, if all countries comply with the advice given by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On 17 March, is Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Typical Medicine saying that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially take up to one or two years.</seg>
<seg id="53">Neil Ferguson in the Imperial College study said it would be a different distance and more precautions "unless there is no vaccination (in the coming 18 months or longer)".</seg>
<seg id="54">William Shaffer from Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this corona virus - because it is easy to spend completely will disappear and it is possible" to turn into a seasonal disease, to come back every year.</seg>
<seg id="55">The return of the virus will depend on the extent of immunity and change.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively "unspecified" and patients may have unpleasant symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">Two common symptoms are 88% fever and 68% dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="58">A small number of general symptoms include fatigue, bulimia, abdominal sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and abdominal cramps, chronic pain, headache, circulatory disease, convulsions, hematosis, pneumonia, or cyanosis. The World Health Organization says that one in six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of urgent symptoms, including respiratory problems, pain or stress in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in falling asleep and face or sprains in the lips. Having these symptoms commercialized immediate medical attention. This prevalence can also bring more severe symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, substance abuse and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">There will be no symptoms in these patients and there will be no medical symptoms, but in diagnosis the disease will appear, the researcher advised that those who have turned sick closely with those who have been sick will be kept informed and investigated to terminate the disease.</seg>
<seg id="61">China has spent 44% of the disease without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="62">There are 14days between symptoms and pollution, there were more than 5 days, in this case uncertain, whereas COVID-19 is 30 percent of the sensation of incorporation in people and then 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some descriptions about how to spread the disease are still in the specification stage.</seg>
<seg id="64">The first disease is spread by people living in close contact, due to weather drops, fog or nearby people talking 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).</seg>
<seg id="65">The findings show that due to cough in the open air, the virus can be transmitted from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 (27) feet.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some people suggest that the virus can also be transmitted in the form of small drops in the air because it stays in the air for a long time, which does not leave the mouth at the time of speech, respiratory drops are also found during breathing but when speaking, the following virus is not found powerful in the air.</seg>
<seg id="67">These drops can be found in the mouth of nearby people or in the nose or possibly go into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical practices such as antiviral and cardiopulmonary artery (CPR) are also respiratory moisture aerosols and can be spread in the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">The virus may also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces including the skin, eyes, nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is also concern that the disease can spread through waste fertilizer but this risk is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has denied the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has spread from contamination. The virus spreads more than three days after symptoms arise, although symptoms appear and there is a possibility of spreading before the betterment stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="72">People tested positive for the disease three days before the start of the influenza with the possibility of transmission before significant symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only reports of asymmetric cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymmetric transmission was identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads easily, a person usually infects two to three others. The virus lives on for hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the virus was found to be detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on board card for one day, and in copper for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pet animals and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that the animals carry the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with the animals, such as with other surfaces that could be linked to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">The severe and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new virus that was first taken from three patients with severe acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All outbreaks of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in a related coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which analyzes its protective lifespan. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is said that the virus drug is from animals.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis reveals that corona virus genetically clusters two stem cells together with the beta corona virus gene in the vegetable sarbic virus (ratio).</seg>
<seg id="82">This is 96% similar to other colloquial corona virus patterns (BatCov RaTG13) in the whole genome.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in some parts of the genome range there is only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans.</seg>
<seg id="84">Relatively 92% of the genetic material compared to the complete genome with the date has been found to be shared between the penguin corona virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the penguin to be a medium host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection by virus can be briefly diagnosed based on symptoms, although the confirmation is ultimately due to the reaction of the polymeric chain of infected products or CT imaging.</seg>
<seg id="86">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more susceptible to PCR, although less specific, with most of its reactions covered with other pattern and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Until March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or for screening" to diagnose COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first published on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Tests can be done on respiratory or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">Results are usually available from a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Typically these tests are conducted on the nasopharyngeal web while the throat web can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6,2019, none of this has proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, a serological test developed by Celtics was only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Characteristics of imaging in radio and computational tomography (CT) that are symptoms include irregular peripheral germ episodes and irreversible optimal factors.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiologists Association compiles an international online database of photographic findings for confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to overuse with other infections such as adeno virus, photography without approval by PCR has a limited specification in identifying COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large study in China compared the PCR with the CT results and revealed that although the reaction is less specific to infection, it is faster and more susceptible, suggesting this consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">Strong nervous networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect viral reactions with both radios and CT.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, forbidding leaving hands with hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or chopping and putting tissue directly in a drainage container.</seg>
<seg id="101">People who may already have an infection are recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.</seg>
<seg id="102">Physical distance measures were also proposed to prevent transmission. Many states restricted or advised all non- essential travel to countries and regions affected by the growth.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading in large parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some community members don't know where and how they are infected. Health care providers care for those who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact fixing is an important method for health officials to determine the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">Amid privacy concerns raised by governments using location data from mobile phones for this purpose, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations called for such oversight restrictions in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile apps have been implemented or offered for voluntary use, and from April 2020 to 20 expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to get users closer to other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Users then receive a message if they have a close relationship with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spread about how to prevent infection. For example, cleaning the nose and mouth wash are not effective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is no CoVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to make it a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC recommends that people wash for at least twenty seconds often with soap and water, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are apparently dirty; before eating; and after hitting the mat, cough or cough.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bladder.</seg>
<seg id="112">The CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based handheld sanitizer for at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization tells people not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth until your hands are washed.</seg>
<seg id="114">Pages can be synthesized against the virus with the help of a number of solvents (intoxicated polyps face virus cleaners for at least a minute) that include 62-71% to ethanol, 50-100% to ios propylene, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen on oxide and 0.2-7.5% to podone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solvents such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohyxidine gluconate are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC identifies which office or any other locality has a suspected case of corona, so all rooms, bathrooms, joint situations, joint electrical machines such as tablets, touch sugar, rolls, remote controls and ATM machines which are used by the pathogen can all be cleaned from viruses.</seg>
<seg id="117">Health organizations cover their mouth and nose with sneeze collection or fabrics during cough or inflammation, and then equip these fabrics immediately.</seg>
<seg id="118">Surgery can be recommended for individuals who have contracted the virus, which can reduce their ability to cough, sneeze or travel when they are not exposed to respiratory drops.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization recommends when and how to use the mask.</seg>
<seg id="120">Stephen Grafton, a virus scientist at the University of Leeds, commits people to touching their faces by putting on masks that do not properly clean their hands as a result of the most aggressive use of gossip. Masks can also be recommended for individuals who take care of and care of ill individuals.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization advises healthy individuals to wear masks if they are at greater risk, such as individuals who are not affected by COVID-19 and they also agree that by putting masks they can not keep their faces from touching.</seg>
<seg id="122">Many countries have begun to encourage people to use masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the United States, the CDC has advised putting unwanted medical barriers on faces made of cloth. China has advised putting unwanted medical barriers on privately healthy tenants and then on when they are near others (1 meter (3 feet) or less.</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong Public Transport has advised to undergo surgery if travelling or staying in the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health authorities expect the general population to build faces out of the cloth in their homes and then wash them daily.</seg>

<seg id="130">Taiwan, which has been making 10 million barrels a day since March, on April 1 forced the use of barrels to ferry passengers onto buses between the cities.</seg>
<seg id="131">The panellist has assumed that the use of face barriers when leaving is impractical and has advised tenants who can't afford barriers to prepare themselves in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="132">Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore use large quantities of face barriers.</seg>
<seg id="133">Keeping distance from each other (also known as maintaining physical distance) involves patrolling operations aimed at alleviating the spread of the disease by reducing tension.</seg>
<seg id="134">Methods include self-imposing travel restrictions and the closure of festivals, work sites, playgrounds, exhibitions and markets.</seg>
<seg id="135">Individuals should stay home, by reducing their journey, by not going to the world, not accompanying each other at a time of greeting and staying away from other tenants in practice of their own methods of living.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many governments are forced to stay away from each other in those zones or advise that they are not affected by the disease.</seg>
<seg id="137">A large outbreak by the U. S. government and health organizations immediately brought the death toll from 250 tonnes (if not spread COVID-19) in the zone to 50 tonnes and then to 10 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="138">On 22 March, Germany banned the gathering of more than two dozen people, elderly adults and those who are undergoing treatment for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, breathing disease, hypertension, and weak immune system were at increased risk of severe illness, as the CDC advised the victim to stay at home. Last March 2020, Dublin and other health agencies changed the term "social vision" to "physiological removal", keeping the victim visible with golden physiological interaction reduction purposes, if he was forced to stay at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="139">The term "social distance" has been implicated in the fact that people are temporarily engaging in social isolation, not encouraging others to interact with each other in ways some authorities have also given guidance for sexual health during vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="140">These include specific recommendations that a person who acts sexually with a person who is living with it, a person who is not viral or has no symptoms of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="141">Special isolation is recommended at home for those who have found this coveted disease and who are suspected to have the disease.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies give detailed guidance for appropriate specific isolation. Many governments have tasked or recommended self-sufficiency in the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="143">Strict guidelines for suicide victims have become increasingly dangerous groups.</seg>
<seg id="144">Those who have met these people who have not been affected by Kovid 19 and who have traveled to such a country or region in the near days where virus spread is increasing, they have also been prescribed self-sufficient for 14days.</seg>
<seg id="145">Policies on prevention and prevention of diseases are included in the policy of controlling evidence.</seg>
<seg id="146">Limiting the virus is done in the first steps of the beginning to identify and separate the virus from others, as well as another goal is to determine the level of control and vaccination related areas to prevent the destruction of other people.</seg>
<seg id="147">When the restriction of the disease is impossible, it is attempted at the stage of reference: Measures are being taken to reduce the spread rate and limit the effects of the disease on the society and the health system.</seg>
<seg id="148">It is also possible to accommodate the stages of restriction and reduction of pulse.</seg>
<seg id="149">Removal of the pulse requires more serious measures to reduce the pulse so that the basic number of the propagation is less than 1. An infectious pulse management is to try to reduce the graph tip of the pulse posted to it.</seg>
<seg id="150">This lowers the risk to health care providers who have been eliminated and provides extra time to develop other therapeutic services and vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-discriminatory measures that can control the virus, are individual protective measures such as: Hand washing, wearing a mask, and self-consciousness; and social measures that include social orientation such as: Closing schools and vocabulary of large gatherings; and accepting these restrictions by society and involving the public in these measures and formulating it; as well as outstanding measures such as cleaning surfaces. When the severity of the virus began to appear, China took the most serious measures to limit the severity of the virus, such as: Imposing shorter quarantine of cities and imposing strict restrictions on travel.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea questioned all its people and implemented preventive measures and issued serious warnings for the movement of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provided financial assistance to those who committed suicide and fined those who did not commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan increased the production of masks and penalized prospective health care providers. The similarities of Britain and the United States show that there are major challenges in curbing the virus (not reducing its spread) and curbing the virus (preventing the outbreak).</seg>
<seg id="156">Communicating the virus policy may reduce the demand for health care to 2 1 / 3 and half the death toll, but it could still cost hundreds of thousands of lives and destroy health care.</seg>
<seg id="157">Virus surveillance may be preferable but should continue until the virus is present among the people (and if the vaccine is developed before then this stage should last for the same period), but if measures are taken it will soon return to virus.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term limitations for limiting the virus can cause social and economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="159">There are no specific anti-virus drugs for Coved19, but development efforts are still underway to include the testosterone of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Using fever medication, drinking fluid, and relaxation may help to reduce the cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="161">According to the intensity of the pulse, the use of artificial oxygen, serum, and respiratory system strength is essential for the health of the pulse.</seg>
<seg id="162">Steroids can cause consequences with use.</seg>
<seg id="163">Many compounds that were for other viral diseases have also been used to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization said that some "traditional and family therapies" can relieve the symptoms arising from SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The World Health Organization (WHO) has described increasing capacity and health care measures for COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="166">The ECDC and the World Health Organization's regional office of hospitals in Europe have outlined different levels of delivery guidelines to Primary Health Services, including giving more attention to COVID-19 diagnosis in Liberia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Quota-19 risk control measures in the workplace</seg>
<seg id="2">Quota-19 risk control measures in the workplace include using workplace safety and health methods to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (quota-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Significant risk control measures in the workplace, risk assessment of sources of infection, severity of disease in society, and risk factors of any employee who may be infected with Covid-19 depend on the workplace and the job.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the U. S. Office of Professional Safety and Health (OSHA), there is a minimal working relationship with people and other employees in low-risk jobs, which is recommended to take preventive measures to prevent the disease. Preventive measures include washing up, telling employees to stay at home in case of an illness, taking preventive measures to prevent the transmission of the disease through respiration, and routinely cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">The average risk of infection is those who need to maintain constant and close contact with anonymous people who are suspected of Covid-19 disease, but may become sick due to ongoing social transition and international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This working environment includes employees who have contact with people, such as schools, a crowded working environment, and crowded retail locations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to initial disease prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective ventilation filtering, plastic or glass screens, personal safety equipment or equipment because you may encounter a person who is infected with Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">The U. S. Bureau of Professional Safety and Health (OSHA) assumes that health and veterinary workers who are infected and suspected with Covid-19 disease are placed at a higher risk of getting infected. If employees are infected with Covid-19 disease and suspected people are exposed to existing particle production procedures in the air or collect samples from them for testing, the risk of infection reaches a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk control measures that are appropriate for these employees include engineering controls, such as negative pressure aerodynamic rooms, and tasks suitable for personal security equipment.</seg>
<seg id="10">The spread of Covid-19 can have a huge impact on the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may not be able to attend work because of fear of getting sick, the need for more thoughtful care, and fear of getting sick.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business methods may change. These methods may also change according to the demand of goods and also by the means that these components are obtained (such as, shopping during low load, or delivering fast services to customers or by car / motorcycle)</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, from those geographical regions severely affected by Coved-19, shipping routes may be cut. A preparedness and response plan against the spread disease can be used to guide safe measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">Plans are drawn up to various workplace and job related risk factors including infected resources, risk factors from home, and social spaces and high age and persistent health conditions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, those control measures are identified in the plans to address those risks and present possible plans for situations that may result in the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans for preparedness and reactions against infectious diseases may require national and regional recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objective of reacting to the spread of an infectious disease is to reduce the transmission rate of the disease among employees, save people who are at risk of very complex health conditions, continue working activities, and reduce side effects on other institutions in the supply chain of activities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The severity of the disease in that society affects the reactions carried out by business activities.</seg>
<seg id="19">The range of risk control measures is the chart, which is widely used to classify risk-control measures as effective during work safety and health.</seg>
<seg id="20">The most effective control measures are from engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal security equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering controls, without relying on staff, separate employees from work-related risks, and are probably the lowest cost effective way to implement this task.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative controls are changes in employment policies or procedures that require action by the employee and the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal security equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal security should be assigned to the employee based on the risk of consequences, properly installed (i.e., respiratory), worn continuously and properly, regularly checked, kept, and changed if necessary, and should be properly removed, cleaned and removed to prevent contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">The U. S. Bureau of Labor Safety and Health (OSHA) says there is a small working relationship between people and colleagues in low-risk jobs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Preventive measures to prevent the spread of the disease, which is recommended for all workplaces, washing their hands frequently and completely if the worker is sick, preventing the transmission of the disease through respiration including cough and worms, preparing dishes for paperwork properties and used items, preparing for telephone calls or changing shifts if necessary, preventing employees from using other equipment, and routinely keeping the working environment clean and clean.</seg>
<seg id="27">The most important step in ensuring the safety of employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace is the rapid introduction and separation of possible infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of respiratory system acute respiratory syndrome should stay at home until their fever is detected for at least 24 hours using fever deficiencies or schizophrenia, fever symptoms are removed, and other schizophrenia can be eliminated. Vacation policies should be modified, employees should be allowed to take care of sick members at home, and that employees are aware of these policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the U. S. Bureau of Professional Safety and Health (OSHA), the average risk of infection involves employees who are not infected or suspected of being infected with people who are not infected with Coved-19, are in close contact at a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the transmission of the disease in the community around workplaces, where the person has recently traveled internationally to the place where Coved-19 has spread widely.</seg>
<seg id="30">These include employees who are generally in contact with the public, such as in schools, highly crowded work environments, or retail sales moguls or locations where the number of customers is greatly increased. Engineering controls for these and highly risk groups, effectively installing air filters, increasing the number of evacuation centers, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic curtains, providing quick services through customer service vehicles / motorcycles. Administrative controls for such and high-risk groups include recommending patients to stay at home, holding face-to-face meetings through virtual contact, holding various work shifts, stopping unnecessary trips to locations containing autoimmune diseases, empowering employees to make emergency calls, developing emergency contact plans, providing fresh information on emergency calls, and training</seg>
<seg id="31">Employees of this at-risk group need very little respiratory care.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone is sick on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of staff and other passengers, separating other passengers and staff from others by keeping a distance of 6 feet, suggesting wearing a mask to the sick person, and asking the sick person to keep their mouth and feet closed during cough and malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="33">Passengers of the relevant cabin must use medical handlers once they are taken care of by a sick passenger or touch fluid or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if possible use other personal security equipment in case a sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Handguns and one-time consumer goods should be put in red / hazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. Risk controls for shipping and transportation on commercial vessels including ships and other passenger ships include suspending travel when someone is sick, and if someone has fever and other symptoms of the disease on board, they should be separated from others and informed by medical staff on board.</seg>
<seg id="35">Essentially, medical observation is done in the cockpit of an isolated person. For the Centers for Schools and Children's Care, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends temporary school leave if a sick person has not come to school considering the social spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a low chance of reducing social transition, social distance strategies should be implemented, such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or canceling banquets at church inns or cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, changing arrival and return times, limiting / reducing unnecessary visits, and using separate health office space for children with disabilities like colds.</seg>
<seg id="37">As the transmission of the disease in the local community continues to strengthen, in addition to social distance strategies, extended school vacations may be taken into account. From the perspective of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to law enforcement personnel who conduct daily activities and activities are considered at low risk of emergency health.</seg>
<seg id="38">The rule of law requires authorities, who may even contact suspects infected with Covid-19, to follow relevant guidelines including appropriate personal security equipment for emergency medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="39">If contacted closely during detention, employees must clean their belongings and military clothes on house-made weapons before using them for a second time, and follow standard operating procedures / procedures to protect and destroy used personal safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="40">The U. S. Bureau of Labor Safety and Health (OSHA) assumes that health and care workers are suffering from a high and highly contagious disease.</seg>
<seg id="41">Highly susceptible tasks include health care and aid providers, laboratories, and medical transportation workers who are suffering from and suspected of Covid-19 disease.</seg>
<seg id="42">If employees are infected with Covid-19 disease and suspected people have applied procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air or collect samples from them for testing, the risk of infection reaches a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="43">Procedures for preventing the production of particles present in the air include piping in the body, the alcohol method of cough, bronchoscopy, some tooth related procedures and examinations, collecting large amounts of samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The highly infectious disease targeting tasks involve employees who are engaged in preparing the body of people who are known to be infected or suspected of being infected with Covid-19 while dying. If these employees perform a genetic examination, their infection rate increases. Additional engineering controls for this group risk group include separating rooms for patients infected with Covid-19 and suspected patients, as well as preventive procedures for producing existing particles in the air.</seg>
<seg id="45">Specific aerosols of negative stress may be appropriate in some health and targeting centers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be taken into consideration the previous measures of Biosafety Level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be kept in separate waiting facilities depending on the suspected case of Covid-19. In addition to other personal safety equipment, the U. S. Bureau of Labor Safety and Health (OSHA) recommends respiratory devices for employees who work with SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected patients at a distance of 6 feet and employees who perform preventive procedures to produce particles present in the air.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the United States, N95 face respiratory masks approved by the NIOSH or better should be used in an extensive and written respiratory safety program. The program includes proper, training and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respiratory devices can be used to provide better protection and ease for the worker. The World Health Organization does not recommend a cover / cut, because Coved-19 is a respiratory disease.</seg>
<seg id="50">The World Health Organization recommends only a medical mask for inspection personnel at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="51">The World Health Organization recommends respiratory samples of Coved-19 patients, taking care of them or transporting them from one place to another without performing preventive procedures for producing existing particles in the air, surgical masks, earphones, face masks, medical clothing and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">If the procedure for preventing the production of existing particles in the air is carried out, the surgical mask can be worn instead of the N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Because the universal readiness of personal safety equipment is inadequate, the World Health Organization recommends the use of personal safety equipment such as remote sanitation and physical obstacles, clean windows, reducing the need for personal safety equipment, allowing only those who take care of Covid-19 patients directly, using only personal safety equipment for specific essential tasks, such as removing a respiratory mask during care for a like-minded patient, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal safety equipment, and not disposing of masks for caregivers.</seg>

<seg id="1">B. coronavirus disease 2019 or coved-19 is an infectious disease that causes severe acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus 2.</seg>
<seg id="2">Normal symptoms include fever, cough, and asthma.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other reasons are fatigue, organ pain, diarrhea, chronic pain, loss of sensation, diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incubation time for infection and symptoms is about five days, but it may take between two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">While many incidents are common knowledge, some involve viral chest failure and the absence of many physical failures.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported from 210 countries and regions around the world, with more than 153,000 people dying.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads through small drops during close contact between people early, often during cough, malnutrition and speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">While these drops are produced during stick distribution, usually these drops grow on the ground or other surfaces, but are not an infectious virus through a very long distance.</seg>
<seg id="9">People can also get the virus by touching the contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive for 72 hours on various surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is very spread and infectious during the first three days after the beginning of the cause, although the virus can appear before the cause of the disease or spread in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosing the disease is carried out by the reversible transmitting polymerase chain racing through the nezopharyngeal swab / diocese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of masks is renewed for those who are suspected of having the virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recommendations for using a mask differ publicly, with some officials commenting on not using it, some calling for its use and some calling for its use.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there is no vaccine or anti-viral therapy to treat Coved-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Transmission of the disease was recorded locally in all six regions of the World Health Organization (WHO), in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">People who are infected with the virus may not have symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue or asthma.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reasons for an emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and hypertension, gangsta, severe falling asleep, red face and lips; in addition to these symptoms or symptoms, receiving emergency medical attention is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unusually, causes of the upper respiratory system include paralysis, oily nose, or throat pain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gastrointestinal causes, such as arthritis, vomiting and diarrhea, have been observed in various percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Initially, in some cases in China only chest blockage and heart rate have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease reached the chest, the absence of many physical organs and death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This tells the stage of inequality.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation phase of the Coved-19 is normally six days but may vary between two to 14.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5% of people who appear to be infected with the virus take 11.5 days to appear. Reports show that all those who are infected with the virus do not show knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of transplants without these reasons is not yet known; however, the first evidence shows that they may help spread the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of people infected with the virus whose symptoms do not appear is currently unknown and is under investigation. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remained in hospital without knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since April 1, China's National Health Commission (NHC) has also started recording cases of schizophrenia in daily cases; on the same day, 166 out of 130 or 78% of people infected with the virus did not show schizophrenia during examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">It went on and there was a high virus in Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speaking louder than normal speaking releases more drops.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that a bipolar cough can transport sweat drops up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although the virus is not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioviral transmission may be possible and weather collection equipment installed in the corridor outside people's rooms found samples that were positive for viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures like pipe crossing / exposure and cardiopulmonary reception may cause respiratory secretions to aerosols and later spread the virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although there are concerns that it is transmitted through sewage, the trust level of this risk is low. The virus is very infectious when people have symptoms and symptoms; while there is a possibility of spreading before the cause arises, and the risk may be low.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is clear how easily the disease can spread, a person can typically infect two to three people with the virus. The virus survives on surfaces for hours or days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the virus can survive on paper panels for up to one day, on plastics (polypropylene) and iron (AIS304) for up to three days, and 99% copper can survive for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevertheless, the survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and air temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and washing materials that can be applied properly are very effective; soap related substances eliminate virus dual safe coating, activate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also, other solvents, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. In Hong Kong, samples of flour were taken on average two days after being hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="39">In sixty-five patients, the first sample showed that the virus was taking a high level, and the sixth patient showed that the level of virus taking the virus increased on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus virus, which was first isolated from three chest infections related to the group having acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the knowledge of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is found in coronaviruses related to its nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by the use of soap in homes, which breaks the virus's liver cover. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the origin of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lungs are the organs of the body that are affected by Covid-19, because the virus gains access to host cells through the injectable enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is collected in the second type of lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus uses a specific glycoprotein on the surface called "Spike / Spike" (peplomer) and circulates to the ACE2 enzyme and into the cells related to this enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="45">Acute cardiovascular injury was found in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan state of China and such incidents occur more frequently in severe diseases.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cause of cardiovascular diseases during the development of disease due to inflammatory reactions and confusion in the immune system, but cardiovascular muscle injury may be associated with the ACE2 enzyme receptor / receptor in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors / receptors appear in the heart and perform their activity in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the emergency care room, people with Covid-19 disease were found to have a high blood clot incident (31%) and incidence of yeast bleeding in the veins (25%), which caused them to be less aware of the disease. An adverse change in the structure of the lungs due to Covid-19 was found, and inflammation of lymphocytes in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although the respiratory system of the SARS-COV-2 virus has the immune system for ACE2 exposed epithelial cells, severely infected patients with Coved-19 have systemic high levels of inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Specifically, patient-generating GM-CSF secretions were shown in T-cell cells that collect inflammatory IL-6 secretion monomers in patients infected with Coved-19 virus and are linked to the identification or pathology of severe lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="51">The presence of lymphatic encephalitis has also been reported in the grafting process.</seg>
<seg id="52">The World Health Organization has published many testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Artificially reversible transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is a standard method of examination.</seg>
<seg id="54">Generally, examination is done on respiratory patterns obtained by the nasopharyngeal pimple. However, patterns of the pimple or bladder may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results of the examination are achieved between a few hours and two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can be carried out, but two blood samples are required in this examination, the second sample is taken two weeks after the first sample and the results of each sample require a little more time.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists were able to separate and spread the evolutionary range with the appearance / origin of coronavirus, so laboratories around the world could independently conduct polymerase neural response (PCR) tests to detect the disease through virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">On 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which involves active sickness and that a person has already been infected and yeah, it is found) was in development, but has not been widely used yet.</seg>
<seg id="59">The proven accuracy and accuracy of Chinese experiences with examination is only 60 to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">The U. S. FDA on 21 March 2020 approved the first care test or test for use at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines, published by Wuhan University Lifeguards Hospital, recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical knowledge and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Dual glass arrangements are common in the immediate emergence of diseases from environmental, contradictory and recent distribution.</seg>
<seg id="62">The submarine is dominated and crystallized (the lobster curtains are invariably filled with pulsed aloe or hole), and the combination may appear with the progression of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="63">The microscopic tap and pathology of Covid-19 is less accessible.</seg>
<seg id="64">Key findings of damage identification during genetic examination include:</seg>
<seg id="65">Microscopy: Pulmonary, peptides, pulmonary oedema or fluid collection in airborne tissues of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="66">Four types of severity or severity of viral chest bleeding can be observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Normal breast cells: Pulmonary oedema or fluid accumulation in airborne cells and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, largely unknown pneumocytes, besides interstellar / holistic inflammation, lymphatic encephalitis and the formation of large multicellular cells.</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe chest bleeding: An inflammatory secretion in the lungs along with adverse changes in lung structure (DAD).</seg>
<seg id="69">Adverse changes in the structure of the lungs (DAD) are caused by the cause of severe acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.</seg>

<seg id="71">Blood: Widespread blood clots inside the rig (DIC); Lucoroteroblatic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to reduce the chances of being infected with the virus include staying at home, avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands of water and soap for at least 20 seconds, maintaining the cleanliness of the respiratory system, and avoiding touching the mouth, eyes, and feet of unwanted hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and abdomen with papillomavirus during cough or worm.</seg>
<seg id="74">After all kinds of cough and malnutrition, follow the cleansing of hands properly.</seg>
<seg id="75">Also, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using face-covering cloth / patches in public places to reduce the transmission of the virus from a person with the cause of the disease. The goal of social distance strategies, through closing schools and workplaces, imposing travel restrictions, and canceling major public meetings, is to reduce the contact rate of people infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">The distance guidelines also stipulate that people live at least 6 feet (1.8m) away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is clearly no effective treatment yet for the prevention of Covid-19 disease. Although the disease vaccine is not expected until 2021, the key to preventing Covid-19 virus is an attempt to reduce the development of the disease to a higher level, known as "curative contraception / pulmonary".</seg>
<seg id="78">Also, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people wash their hands frequently for 20 seconds, especially after not coming out of the bathroom or when their hands are sick / contaminated urine, before eating and after cooking, cough and worms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The center also recommends the use of 60% alcoholic hand sanitizer, but only if soap and water are not clearly available. In places where hand trade sanitizer is not easily accessible, the World Health Organization offers two local production formulas.</seg>
<seg id="80">In this formulation, anti-microbial activity is connected to ethanol or isopropol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial eggs in alcohol. It is "not an active substance to eliminate the microbes of the hands".</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a researcher substance.</seg>
<seg id="83">People are administered with supportive care. These care include fluid treatment, oxygen giving, and assistance to other vital affected organs / organs.</seg>
<seg id="84">The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of the virus wear a simple mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Giving oxygen outside the body screen (ECMO) is used to solve the problems of eliminating the activity of the respiratory system, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="86">Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are designed to strengthen the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="87">HIV / AIDS treatment is useful for people who have common knowledge of the disease in the early stages. The World Health Organization and China's National Commission for Health have issued recommendations for the care of people who have been infected with Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">Intellectuals and lung specialists in the United States have published recommendations for the treatment as a free source from various agencies, the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some healthcare providers recommend prescribing perisotamol (acetaminophen) as the first use to eliminate causes.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautionary measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially those procedures in health facilities, such as inserting a pipe into the body or handling air to the patient while they can produce particles in the air.</seg>
<seg id="92">For health care providers who care for people infected with Coved-19 virus, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends standard precautionary measures, including contact precautions and aerial precautions, placing a patient in the airborne virus isolation room (AIIR). The Center for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal safety equipment during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="93">What are the decomposed items and devices: Personal safety medical clothing, respiratory tract or face mask, phenomenon / eye safety, medical gloves / gloves. Respiratory tract instead of face mask is considered as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 respiratory tract has been approved for industrial sites, but the FDA allowed the use of a membrane mask based on official permission (EUA) for use during emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="95">These masks are designed to protect against particles like pollen and glare in the air, but their effectiveness against a particular biological virus is not guaranteed, except for signed use.</seg>
<seg id="96">When not masks, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using facial rescues made at home as part of a recent effort.</seg>
<seg id="97">Many cases of Covid-19 are not as severe as mechanical respiratory ventilator or alternative, but in some cases it is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">Types of respiratory system assistance to disinfect the respiratory system of Coved-19 related patients have been actively investigated in the hospital. Some evidence suggests that pipe insertion should not be used during the respiratory pipe or the positive pressure machine of bilateral air conditioning (BiPAP).</seg>
<seg id="99">Whether these two methods will benefit people who are severely ill is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors prefer to use mechanical ventilator through the mouth because such a technique limits the spread of airborne particles more than putting a respiratory pipe in the foot. Severe cases are typically in the elderly (who are more than 60 years old, and premature ones who are over 80 years old).</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries do not have enough beds in hospitals for each person. This limits the capacity of the health system to control the sudden rise in the number of Coved-19 cases required for bedding.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5% of patients were hospitalized in ICU, 2.3% needed ventilator mechanical assistance and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">Nearly 30% of patients infected with Covid-19 in China were eventually hospitalized in ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">Mechanical ventilator becomes more complicated when the cause of acute respiratory disease increases in Covid-19 and oxygen becomes more severe.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ventilators that have the capacity of pressure control mode and PEEP should increase their oxygen levels, while also reducing the risk of lung injury and neurotransmitters related to ventilator.</seg>
<seg id="106">High levels of PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and many anti-virus drugs are being tested in clinics.</seg>
<seg id="108">It seems that rheumatoid can be a very hopeful medication.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although developing new drugs may last until 2021, many of the tested drugs are already approved for further use or are already being tested in an advanced form.</seg>
<seg id="110">Anti-viral drugs may be tested on severely ill people.</seg>
<seg id="111">The World Health Organization is asking volunteers to take part in tests on the effectiveness and safety of possible medications. The FDA granted temporary formal permission to give a reconstructed patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a patient's life is severely and urgently threatened.</seg>
<seg id="112">This experimental treatment has not been experienced during clinical studies that show it is safe and effective for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to help fight the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are asked to write their name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can be used to monitor "close contact" and a possible risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of the other three users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a possible danger is found, the app not only recommends self-consciousness, but also local health authorities. Large-scale data-analysis on mobile databases, facial recognition technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence are used to track sick people who have interacted with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor the mobile databases of people who may have corona.</seg>
<seg id="119">This action was taken to practice contraception and to protect people who may be connected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom partnered with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koche Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to identify and locate convicted terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of the population is getting around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government granted 48 hours of leave at the end of the week with the presence of more than 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kirsti Kaljulik called for five solutions against the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience depression from pneumonia, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or from the disease / virus.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC's Rory O'Connor said: "Overwhelming social isolation, inequality, health divisions, stereotypes, and economic downturn are an immediate disadvantage to the mental health and wellbeing of people."</seg>
<seg id="127">Disease may occur alongside the presence or absence of certain causes and in normal condition with other common diseases such as chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="128">Normal incidents usually take up to two weeks, while repairing severe and severe incidents may take three to six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="129">Based on the dataset of viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at a higher risk due to the severity of Covid-19 disease, but there is no relevant dataset on Covid-19. Some infected people with Covid-19 may be affected and cause chest bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="130">In severely affected people, Coved-19 virus may rapidly cause acute respiratory illness (ARDS) resulting in the activation of the respiratory system, spreading the virus throughout the body and causing the activation of many members of the body.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complex conditions related to Covid-19, the virus spread throughout the body, blood clots are unusual, damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.</seg>
<seg id="132">Blood clots, particularly during proteomics, were found in 6% of coved-19 patients in hospitals, while kidney function was observed in 4% of patients in this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20-30% of the population saw an increase in the level of the liver transaminosis enzyme, which was infected with Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to this report, the average time between starvation and death was 10 days besides five days in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="135">In addition, people who were transferred to ICU rooms had an average time of seven days between bed and death.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to a study of early cases, the average time between the cause of early death and death was 14 days, with the overall time for patients to get sick and the total time of death ranging from six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study by China's National Health Commission, men's death rate was 2.8%, while women's death rate was 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological examinations of lung patterns after death showed both lung tissue injuries and the inflammatory secretion of cellular fibromyalgia in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in the nodes.</seg>
<seg id="140">The picture of the lungs resembled the cause of acute respiratory illness.</seg>
<seg id="141">At 11.8% of the reported deaths, troponin levels and heart disease related to heart failure were observed by the National Health Commission of China.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the United States, 89% of bedridden patients had symptoms prematurely, according to the March data. Access to medical resources and the social economy of a region may be affected by death.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of deaths from such a situation differ due to regional differences, but also methodological differences.</seg>
<seg id="144">Showing a small number of normal incidents can cause the death toll to rise above estimates.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the fact that mortality due to infected incidents in the past means that the current number of deaths is estimated to be less than realistic.</seg>
<seg id="146">Unless smoked, the likelihood of being severely infected with the Coved-19 virus is 1.4 times greater in smokers and the likelihood of getting beaten and dying in the ICU is approximately 2.4 times greater. Concerns have been raised about the long-term side effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">Hong Kong hospital officials identified a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity of people who have recovered from the disease and a lung scan showed organ damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">This may help protect the patient from physical, mental and emotional causes after leaving the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="149">Until March 2020, it was impossible to say whether the previous disease causes effective and chronic immunity in people who are healthy with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">Based on the behavior of other forms of coronavirus, immunity is likely to change, but those cases have been reported to be healthy after testing positive for coronavirus, coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="151">These incidents are believed to cause the worst of persistent diseases rather than new ones.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is believed to be a natural virus and originates from animals through widespread spiders.</seg>
<seg id="153">Its main source is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began spreading almost entirely from one human to another.</seg>
<seg id="154">The study of 41 confirmed cases of Coved-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the start of the cause of the disease was 1 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The earliest date for the start of the cause of the disease was shown in official publications of the World Health Organization (WHO) 8 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Many measures to determine the number of deaths are commonly used.</seg>
<seg id="157">These numbers vary based on each region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of health care system, treatment options, time since the beginning of the disease, and people's characteristics, such as age, gender, and overall health.</seg>
<seg id="158">In late 2019, the World Health Organization used emergency codes of ICD-10 infection. The U07.1 code was approved for those who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the laboratory and the U07.2 code for those who were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2 virus without laboratory approval.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the marginal ratio globally from 17 April 2020 is 6.9%.</seg>
<seg id="160">The numbers vary in each region. Among other measures is the incident death rate, which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who have died from an illness, and the virus death rate that reflects the percentage of people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from an illness.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not prepared based on time and determine the specific people infected through incident recovery.</seg>
<seg id="162">While many ill people do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about why so many people are infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">A small village at the centre of the disease in Italy, Castaglian d'Or, where 4600 people live, 80 (1.7%) died prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Guangdong, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to younger class people whose mortality rate is relatively low and in such a way the death toll of all infected persons on Coved-19 may not be officially hidden.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German health system was not yet under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="166">With the evaluation of blood donors, probably 3% of people in the Netherlands had antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">69 confirmed persons (0.004% of the total population) have died from Coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The effect of diabetes and death rates vary in women and men.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to research in China and Italy, the death rate is much higher in men.</seg>
<seg id="170">Their at-risk age for men is 50 years, with the gap between men and women only closing at 90 years old.</seg>
<seg id="171">Men's death rate in China was 2.8 percent and women's death rate was 1.7percent.</seg>
<seg id="172">The main reason for this difference in gender is not known, but the intellectual and practical factors may be the reason.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender based immunological differences, which spread in women are less likely than men and in men there are several diseases such as high stress in adulthood can cause an increase in their death.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe 57% of the infected were men and 72% of those who died from Covid-19 were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">Until April 2020, the U. S. government did not monitor the gender related dataset of Covid-19 diseases.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that the viral diseases of Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have affected men and women separately.</seg>
<seg id="177">A higher percentage of health care workers, especially nurses, make up women, and they have a greater chance of getting infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="178">The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "Coved-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus revealed that CO in this name comes from corona, VI virus, D infection and 19 for the time being when the disease first started and was identified: 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">This name was assigned to a specific geographic (such as China), Xiaomi, or group of people for refusing to be referred to. This name was assigned in accordance with international recommendations aimed at preventing the conversion. The virus that causes Kvid-19 has the cause of acute respiratory disease called coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has used the "Kuvad-19 virus" and "Kuvad-19 creator virus" in its general statements.</seg>
<seg id="182">Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the beginning of the disease in Wuhan city of China, both virus and disease were called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the World Health Organization named locations on diseases and viruses under a 2015 directive, temporarily naming 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory infections for virus and disease.</seg>
<seg id="185">Official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture footwear containing cotton fillers and sanitary items like respiratory parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">An example is that when a hospital in Italy needed a respiratory tract, and the supply company was not prepared in accordance with the time and time, a new activity company built 100 covers in one night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the first spread of Covid-19 disease, theories about the source, level of disease, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, incorrect information and false information were quickly published on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans can transmit and spread viruses to certain animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Investigations failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in the chain, duck and poultry.</seg>
<seg id="191">No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">International research on Covid-19 vaccines and medicines continues by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched an "isolation test" to assess the three million effects of four existing anti-virus combinations in the hope of effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no accessible vaccine, but many agencies are actively developing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Previous work on SARS-CoV is beneficial because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV -2 use ACE2 receptors to penetrate human cells.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.</seg>
<seg id="197">The first strategy is for researchers to develop a vaccine for the whole virus.</seg>
<seg id="198">The goal of using such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is to stimulate a rapid response of the human body's immunity against the new virus of Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop a subtype vaccine aimed at making the immune system susceptible to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making a vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies should be beneficial for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine in Seattle began on four volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine is an artificially harmless code from the virus that causes the disease. Strengthening reliance on antibodies has been cited as a possible challenge for developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has generated a lot of debate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Since April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">In seven tests assessing approved medicines for malaria, four studies were conducted on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Many Chinese studies involved investigating other illicit drugs, with nine / 9 Phase III tests conducted in many countries as of the end of April, according to reports from Ramadisaurus.</seg>
<seg id="207">Until April 2020, a dynamic study of clinical development for the Coved-19 vaccine and medicine was conducted. Many available anti-virus drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of Coved-19, including rheumatoid, chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine, Lupinavir / arthritis and Lupinavir / retonavirus, as well as inter faera beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">There has been evidence of the effectiveness of rheumatoid testing since March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical progress has been observed in the treatment of reconstructed patients with low rheumatoid use.</seg>
<seg id="210">Clinical trials of Faz III are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was undertaken in February 2020 with preliminary results in China.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, a joint review of the research is being requested.</seg>
<seg id="212">Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">In addition, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while commercializing eating one gram of dosage a day, notes that eating doses of this medication twice a day is very dangerous and can be deadly.</seg>
<seg id="214">On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a request for emergency use of hydroxy chloroquine and chloroquine in accordance with doctors' request to treat patients infected with Covid-19. The use of interferon, ribavirin, or yamphenovir against Covid-19 in China's seven-print guidelines was also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="215">The initial dataset indicates that greater use of ribavirin is necessary to slaughter SARS-CoV-2 in tests.</seg>
<seg id="216">After showing a low concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a more thorough study of neutroxanide was recommended in the trials. The study showed that pumping a high protein through the transmembrane protease serine 2 is important for inserting SARS-CoV-2 through contact with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="217">Research on chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine with and without azetromycin has many limitations that have prevented the health community from using it in medicines without further research. Osteoarthritis does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in tests and has no apparent role in the treatment of Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine disturbances can complicate health conditions in the harsh and recent maintenance of Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxy chloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties. After the completion of a small study, the National Commission of Health of China also incorporated toselizomib drugs into the treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide randomized test Fiz 2 is performed in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="221">To detect cytokine disorders related to serum ferretin blood tests, the purpose of this examination is to prevent such developments which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Interlucent-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA to treat steroid receptor cytokine causes based on previous incident studies that caused a separate cause, CAR T cell, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="223">To this end, there is no random and controlled evidence that toseliazomes can be considered an effective treatment for CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">The transfer of pure and thick antibodies produced from the immune system of people with Covid-19 disease to those who need it, is under investigation as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tested for SARS without results.</seg>
<seg id="226">Defeating the virus is an expensive mechanism of action that strengthens the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 with passive antibody therapy.</seg>
<seg id="227">But other mechanisms, such as antibiotic-derived cellular cytotoxicity and / or physiotherapy, are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy are also being developed using monoclonal pairs of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="229">The production of repaired patients' serum, which involves extracting fluid from healthy patients and using special antibodies to the virus, can increase the number of them spreading rapidly in the body.</seg>
<seg id="230">Coronavirus disease, a group of related causes</seg>
<seg id="231">Lee Wenlang, doctor of Wuhan Central Hospital after increasing awareness of the spread of the virus, was infected with the Coved-19 virus and died from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian stores have lowered the limit on toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Austrian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the sale price of toilet paper to two or one pack at a time in all stores nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aldi also introduced a package limit on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These circumstances were applied in the form of alert messages at WhatsApp sites and on this chain's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report, buyers were stocking up for fear of being convinced by the Kuwaid-19.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also lowered the limit for buying a toilet paper house to one bed.</seg>
<seg id="7">These changes came from giving prepared four packages at a time followed by Woolworths and Coles introduced on March 4 and 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles said in a March 8 media report that according to the four-bedroom limit, "Most stores sell their goods within an hour after arrival" and call the request "unprecedented" on the other side, Aldi calls it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Woolworths spokesman said sales were "extremely high" last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costco Store in Canberra also restricted the allowable amount limit to two last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">To alleviate the shortage, Coles has asked investors to increase large packages and deliveries, Woolworths has ordered additional stock, Because Aldi has prepared stock for a planned special Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rachel Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stock, but because of the ban on trucks by the council it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects an increase in production prices, as supplies try to depress demand and do something special.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, Allianz announced that after the stock expired, some stores were unable to run a special Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Newsweek. Com. AU report, Queensland University-based offshore technologist Dr Gary Mortimer says stores depend on stocks every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that Toyota Piper is a large item, and has a small number, and when sold, locations in large shelves are empty, giving a low stock sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rasheed Zimmerman told ABC News that Klaus and Wolveritas have an idea that if things are on the shelves, and if things like toilet and sanitizer wear out, they may be at low risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Ray Cyclone Piper was quoted as saying last Wednesday that the reservoir is over.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kimberly-Clark quoted Kimberly-Clark as saying that they have worked 24 / 7 to keep suppliers busy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Environment Secretary Dominic Cummings reported that staff at the Melbourne Property auction first and foremost paid free of charge to Tilt Piper, due to a time shortage of Libra Ds.</seg>
<seg id="21">The eighth edition of the Darwin newspaper NTV news Thursday was used by the tabloid Piper.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Australian BBC March 3 reported that stores were not entitled to the ban, and have no plans to ban buying things.</seg>
<seg id="23">Rasul Zimmerman added that demand for other things is also high, including masks, sandwiches, sugar cane, honeydew and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also outside of Australia, on Sunday, British-based online supermarket Andrew Taylor Piper observed 12roll packs.</seg>

<seg id="12">They reminded me how meaningful news is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia, and how powerful a symbol it is as an important resource that is online and accessible to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13">It becomes possible because of your work whether you leave this website open or take money from colleagues or want to keep communities safe.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world needs more information now than ever from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is a moment where not what we do or how we do it, it may have a meaningful effect on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments in how we work together in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Compliance with your work and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robinson mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our policy and schedule for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this conversation, we looked at what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization stable and strong during this period.</seg>
<seg id="20">With great intensity we wanted to eliminate pressure and support our mission in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to dial it again, there is no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors, and contract employees:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily work expectancy is up to the next news, 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="24">We don't have any holidays - if you can work longer than normal hours, the mission can be used by you.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at present the world is not very predictable, and for us your welfare is a priority, if you care about your symptoms, go shopping for a house or go to a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not monitor your time.</seg>
<seg id="27">Don't work if you are sick.</seg>
<seg id="28">This should be done without saying, yet we tell you.</seg>
<seg id="29">No ill leave or PTO required - just call your manager and help your team review the January and schedules to ensure key parts of the job are covered.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you take the result of Covid-19 as positive, please let Brian T &amp; C Ops know so T &amp; C can help you and make sure your situation is properly tackled by management).</seg>
<seg id="31">Entertainment employees are paid their money in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already said and repeatedly respect the commitment of our contractors and employees.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each will be paid based on their normal hours during normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you are sick and unable to work, also included.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people benefit from their work as a way of exerting pressure on the world around us.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we are doing is unbelievably rewarded, especially at a time like now.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it means taking care of your own.</seg>
<seg id="39">Your request is that you talk to your manager, that you know what to expect and can adjust yourself in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some things are considered important.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are some things you need to do.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp;, Safety and Capital Abuse Teams (among others) are doing important work that may require further assistance.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will start a process together with all agencies to assess current goals and shift our focus on supporting what is important for our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are many organisations that do that for us, we should all focus on the most important projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">It doesn't cause pains after going cold for a while now.</seg>
<seg id="46">We don't plan to give twice as much time to reach the end of the pullout ".</seg>
<seg id="47">You are not expected to have done this extra work to meet the deadline, because this work is now fantastic and unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and timetables.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens with annual planning?</seg>
<seg id="50">To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adapt to the schedule for presenting our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">Our intention is to commercialize the extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time to build budgets and gives employees the opportunity to prioritize important work, self-care, empathy care, while replacing those who want to work with reduced schedules in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">The extension of the commission highly reduces the volume and pressure of the current planning work throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will introduce our proposal to the board next week and update the teams on the new measures in accordance with the confirmation received.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office status, suffering from disease, and cleanliness</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we received news that our SF correspondents may have been infected with the Coved-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, despite taking a number of precautionary measures, we have deployed an anti-virus cleanup team to disinfect all the surfaces in the SanFrancisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They use a hospital level anti-virus solution to disinfect every surface as well as the lobby and the elevator side that reaches our floor.</seg>
<seg id="59">Care jobs in the building are utilized by protocol and use materials that help protect tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel comfortable that the office will be properly prepared upon its return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located in WeWork which has shared the Quad-19 protocol with us and the relevant DC staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">Earlier this week, our DC office in San Francisco was completely moved to a remote location, according to a directive shared.</seg>
<seg id="63">As our respective colleagues in New York City understand, we discuss and talk about leasing a place in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">These negotiations are continuing, but there may be delays.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are the first to work in remote areas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our long-term Remainer colleagues know that this may be some kind of discipline, and want to offer you some advice.</seg>
<seg id="67">Limit the length of meetings to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If long meetings are needed, consider how these meetings can be divided into several parts within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Find out the purpose of the meeting clearly, should have an agenda, and send the reading materials before the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="70">Stream the video on Google Docs and Zoom outlets to generate live support and collaboration and contact.</seg>
<seg id="71">Select a leader to set up each meeting. Someone who will monitor the conversation in question and follow the speaker's list and someone who can help take notes (or take notes in common).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a cool microphone or headset, send an email to the technology support section.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your welfare payments to eat breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the # remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Human Resource Activities Team is reviewing the Webinar based organismic guide to support increasing the distribution work across the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked the recipients of association contracts to cancel public programs financed by Wikimedia, such as editorials, until the outbreak has been declared eliminated by the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="77">We informed them that we understand that our obligations for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to conduct activities based on their contract and that no one will be fined for delaying these activities and changing targets.</seg>
<seg id="78">We will begin monitoring other guidelines at Waikmania and other regional and community case conferences next week.</seg>
<seg id="79">It seems that the general feeling of the international community is depressed by confusion, but comfortable in the transparency and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">Before moving forward, CRT is working on creating a page in meteorology to create an atmosphere for the community in order to monitor the impact and to pursue our relationship with them.</seg>
<seg id="81">Having Action with Covid-19 Related Themes</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send a letter on Thursday, 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, to your junior about a special working meeting.</seg>
<seg id="83">We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are in this together and we can help each other in this way.</seg>
<seg id="85">Besides this, you can continue to find information in this email address and find more important information related to Covid-19 in Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will put updates on these pages and keep all the information in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We also work to maintain constant contact with employees who are currently living in the most affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about such travel, programs, major work processes, coverage related challenges, or anything that you need help with, you can do so without any doubt CRT news or work with them.</seg>
<seg id="89">We want to offer support and build relationships if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have confidential and sensitive information, please send it in an email to the head of global human resources operations, Brian Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="91">No change should be seen as abandoning work and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="92">But it is also a recognition that in such a time our work and responsibilities should be organized in a way that was not previously organized.</seg>
<seg id="93">These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other, so we can continue our work, synthesize our activities with the support that they need and serve the world in a way that they can trust.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work is expected to be completed by the time we arrive.</seg>
<seg id="95">For now it is time to support each other and create an atmosphere for the important work that may be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need you to achieve this goal, and ask you to keep the thoughts of yourself and your family, so that you will be ready and singing when the need arises.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Catherine, CRT (Amanda, Amy Woo, Brian Jay, Dorian D, Gregory Wie, Jim Woo, Joel Lyle, Lennart Lyle, Ryan M., and Tony S.), and other members of the leadership team (Grant III, Heather Dobbs, Jim Woo, Jeanine One, Lisa S., Robin O'Rourke, Ryan M., and Toby N).</seg>

<seg id="1">Updating COVID-19 diagnostic standard data for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" is required</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6,2019, our 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infectious disease has published an accelerated consultation guide for diagnosis and treatment, and this guide has provided our experience and provides excellent information to combat this common infectious disease worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease of coronavirus, our awareness and knowledge are increasing regularly based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experiences; therefore, diagnostic and respiratory strategies are constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter we gave an opinion on our guidelines and presented a new diagnostic standard of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", this is based on the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh prescription), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, currently officially named coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus named severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11,2020, the World Health Organization COVID-19 declared a common infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, our team developed a quick consultation guide and on February 06 of 2020 it is published online in Military Medical Research.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.</seg>
<seg id="9">But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experiences, our awareness and knowledge increases regularly; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: / www. NHC. Gov /), January 16,2020 and March 31,2020, have released a total of seven versions, some of which have been increasingly altered.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now our guidelines have received an opinion by Zhou et al, suggesting their scores are based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work adds new evidence to our guidance and is valuable information for this common infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">We confirm their excessive work and express our thanks.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, data from their work should also be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines and recent studies for COVID-19 (exam seventh prescription).</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the seventh version (March 31,2020), the history of infectious disease identification for confirmation of a suspected case must be combined with two substances of clinical evidence to create a comprehensive analysis, or must meet three substances of clinical evidence if the apparent infectious disease identification history does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious Disease Identification History: (1) COVID-19 cases have been reported in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or optical communities where in the last 14 days before the disease began; (2) Lhasa SARS-CoV-2 Relationship History (with positive examination of nucleic acid); (3) with patients from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or optical communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the disease began; (4) A history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms; (4) A history of contact with confirmed case groups with PH7-2 cases of fever and / or respiratory symptoms that came in a small area such as home office, school, etc. During Grade 2.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection with painful forms; (3) The number of white blood cells showed normal, decreased, or decreased the number of lymphomas early.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a substance of pathogenic or cellular evidence as follows: (1) real-time positive testing of PCR for SARS-CoV-2; (2) virtually all genome series that show high similarities with the new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in serum testing; or SARS-CoV-2 positive for specific IgM antibodies from negative to positive, or substance PH7-4 increases during improvement until something is in a severe phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">We can check that the real-time examination of PCR for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second (18 January 18) and third (22 January 2020) versions.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pathogenic identification of the bloodstream was added in the fourth (January 27 2020) and fifth (February 8 2020) versions; and then the evidence of cellulose was added in the seventh version.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to investigate the kit for detecting high levels of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, and examples from respiratory tract including taking blood samples, which added to the availability of variable samples, and supported bringing specific positive results to the approved standard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Besides this, there is additional evidence that we should treat patients with normal symptoms and without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the working map data of Zhou et al. Should be updated, as those without clinical symptoms rated it as "low risk".</seg>
<seg id="24">The scoring system should also be approved in other clinical work and studies.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, we hope to come up with more direct evidence and ask readers to give their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="26">To identify "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that our countries follow new guidelines and comply.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team has periodically renewed their guidance to offer assistance.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are 19-COVID and 2-SARS-CoV methods in testing laboratories for respiratory disease of the 2019 coronavirus virus through which the presence of the virus is diagnosed and the production of antibodies against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed through RT-PCR which diagnoses RNA of the corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In March 2020, the main proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified as a target for medicines after infection.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to identify the most new and active malaria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibiotics can also be used to identify and protect people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests show how many people had this disease, even those who had very little knowledge of the disease and those who expressed knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exact death rate and public safety level can be determined by the results of this oil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to limited tests, until March 2020, no country had accurate statistics on the virus in its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, a country had not tested 3% of its biodiversity, it was often the policy of countries that would not test the literature for these less symptoms, such as Athens, Netherlands, White and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">This diversity also affects the mortality rate of reported cases, which is probably the highest in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="12">Results are usually available from a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR executed on throat samples is only valid during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the virus can disappear from the throat and enter the lips.</seg>
<seg id="15">For people with dementia who get tested in the second week, samples are taken from their deep respiratory pathway using a cough substance (sputum).</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the first PCR tests was conducted in January 2020 at the Berlin Charity, in which a series of real-time detailed mineral polymeric reactions (rRT-PCR) was used and the World Health Organization provided an extension of 250,000 thermal thermometers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UK also conducted a tests on 23rd January 2020. On 28th January 2020 a company called Kogenebych in South Korea developed a clinical scale device to detect temperature based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="18">It seeks E genes and specific SARS-CoV-2 published by Beta Krona Virus. BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to obtain a license from the National Health Products Administration of China to use PCR based SARS-CoV-2 heat diagnostic device. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the 2019 novel Krona virus (2019-nCoV) to its public health laboratories through internationally disabled sources as a precise time-consuming diagnostic device (RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the three genetic tests of older testes resulted in incomplete results and delayed testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">As of February 28,2020, tests performed on two devices were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted to allow tests from state and local laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="21">These tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration through an emergency use permit. U. S. trade laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 5th March 2020 LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are accessible profitably from RT-PCR throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostic also provided access to COVID-19 tests across the country on 9th March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No anthrax restrictions were announced, the collection and processing of samples should be done according to the requirements of the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and developed by the State Research Center for Virus Identification and Vector Biotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="26">Testosterone was registered by the Federal Medicine Service for Healthcare on February 11,2020. On March 12th 2020, Mayo Clinic announced the COVID-19 diagnosis of testosterone. On March 13th 2020, Roche Diagnostic Company received a license from the FDA for such testosterone which will be executed at a high rate in three-and-a-half hours, so a machine method will be performed in almost 4,128 testosterone within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19th 2020 the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories permission for emergency use of the Abbott m2000 testosterone; similar licenses were also granted by the FDA to some laboratories such as: Hologic, Lab Corp and Termo Fischer Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21st 2020, Seinfeld had also obtained an emergency use license from the FDA for a 45-minute testosterone.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA accepts testosterone used in its technology of strengthening thermal nucleic acids rather than PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">This method can identify positive results in at least 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes because the method does not require a series of variable temperature circulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">About 18,000 grafts from these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate the production of these machines to carry 50,000 testers a day. In Taiwan, the discovery of such a method of testosterone, in which an individual antibody is used to combine the nucleoscopic protein (N protein) of krona virus, there is hope that testosterone through this method will take as long as 15 to 20 minutes as the rapid testosterone of influenza.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 literature review concluded that "there is little diagnostic value in the early stages of breast radiation, whereas the findings of CT [calculated tomography] may exist even before symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="33">Dual glass arrangements are common in the immediate emergence of diseases from environmental, contradictory and recent distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">The submarine is dominated and crystallized (the lobster curtains are invariably filled with pulsed aloe or hole), and the combination may appear with the progression of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more susceptible to PCR, although less specific, with most of its reactions covered with other pattern and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or for screening to diagnose COVID-19" until March 2020, WHO recommended the following definitions of cases:</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response against mucus is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These methods are used to track people, determine their immune system, and identify those who have symptoms in the first 7 days or so. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through a care test (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">Highly automated systems in many clinical laboratories will have the capability to perform tests but their availability will depend on the production price for each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">A screen blood sample for CLT is commonly used, although consecutive samples are used to react to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, a blood sample is typically taken by holding the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike the PCR method, the pre-testosterone phase is not necessary. On March 26,2020, the FDA designated no distribution companies that provided notice to the agency as required and are now able to expedite their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7th 2020, only one testosterone had been approved by the FDA through an emergency use license. In late March 2020, the Uruguay Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and epithelope Diagnostic Laboratories received European approval for their test devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The test capacity is several hundred samples within hours and therefore the viral RNA is much faster than the PCR testosterone.</seg>
<seg id="45">Typically antibodies are diagnosed after 14 years of exposure to the disease. In early April, the UK found that none of their purchased diagnostic devices were fatal.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", detect them, send them back and get some after-examination results. The British NHS has announced that it is developing a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the patient's risk if they arrive at the hospital or an ambulance seizure is necessary. Through a drive to test COVID-19 for suspected cases, a health care specialist takes the samples out of proper precautions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Diagnostic medicine inside the vehicle has helped South Korea to make testosterone faster and wider than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it has a capacity of around 12,000 testosterone through planetary diagnosis and had purchased 10.700 testosterone last week.</seg>
<seg id="48">When a dessert is requested by a doctor, the expenses are done by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 testers a week.</seg>
<seg id="50">Till March 19, tests were proposed in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">The total number of tests conducted until 26 March 2020 was not known because only positive incident figures were released.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial survey of the laboratories showed that as of the week of 2020 / 12, a total of at least 483,295 tests were conducted and 33,491 samples including this week (6.9%) were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Israel, researchers from Tikkin and Rambaum Hospital at one time developed and tested a method for memory tests of samples from 64 patients, through the integration of multiple samples, and conducted further tests in case of a positive incident in the combined samples. On February 5,2020, researchers from the BGI in Wuhan established an emergency diagnosis area of 2000 square meters in Hawaii (Chinese: Or English) in addition to more than 10,000 samples a day in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="53">With 5 days of fabrication supervision by BGI founder Wang Jian, the modeling showed that cases in Hubei had increased 47% and the cost related to contraceptive resolution would have doubled if this testing capacity had not been raised in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Hu Yan laboratories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities of China.</seg>
<seg id="55">On 4th March 2020 the testosterone capacity was 50,000 testosterone per day. Open Source, co-authored by Oracle Assis, has published designs that can only test patient samples with the use of 93 testosterone for COVID19 up to 1122. These consistent samples may be performed in smaller laboratories without the need for machine-liquid criticism.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, shortages and insufficient quantities of mercury had grown into a problem for mass testing in the European Union, UK and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">Some authors have been forced to explore protocols for providing samples that include temperature samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. It was announced on March 31 that the United Arab Emirates is now testing its overpopulation for coronavirus in men compared to any other country, and is reaching the level of testing people who have examined its overwhelming population.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was through a combination of inability from a patient's location, and the purchase of a mass examination laboratory from a population of 42 and a BGI group (based on the emergency detection laboratories of David "Ho - Yan" in China).</seg>
<seg id="59">The laboratory established in 14 days is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and at this level is the first laboratory in the world to conduct tests outside of China.</seg>
<seg id="60">Genetic profiles of the corona virus were identified in various fields and various testing procedures were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization sent a German policy to countries with low incomes and no resources to produce kits themselves.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German procedure was published on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not established until 28 January, having delayed existing inspections in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the validity of the testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations made by health experts to conduct tests.</seg>
<seg id="63">In contrast, experts say that the widespread availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to the reduction of the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">The capacity for large-scale inspections in private sector laboratories was established within a few years by the South Korean government.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization demanded that testing programs be accelerated as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 outbreak. High demand for conducting tests due to the development of the virus has led to the collection of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of soybeans and chemicals have been tightened.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their inspection kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC had "shortcomings" after the government removed biochemical barriers that prevented it from conducting tests by private laboratories. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shanghai Biovisual Biotechnology Co., but later found that the results were not accurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company responded that faulty results may be due to difficulty in collecting samples or the incorrect use of kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said they would reinstate the kits which had incorrect results, and instead received differing test kits from the Shanghai Biovisual Company. The Czech Republic, which purchased any test kits from China, gave 80% of the kits faulty results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China after the results were found to be faulty.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad suggested this should be turned into a danube. Atiash Kara from the Turkish health ministry said there were "high degree of mistakes" in test kits purchased from China by Turkey and "did not use them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were not usable.</seg>
<seg id="71">Those tests whose results are positive, patients became convinced and those who were in contact with those who had SARS-CoV-2 positive results were positive.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vanguardia, which is the site of COVID-19's first deaths in Italy, conducted twice as many tests within a distance of around ten days with a total population of around 3,400 people.</seg>
<seg id="73">Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the detected patients were convinced.</seg>
<seg id="74">With limited travel flooding to society, new diseases were completely eradicated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Following an unexpected contact, with restrictions on domestic travel, inspections, and convictions, the 2020 coronavirus disease in Singapore is proceeding much slower than in other developed countries, and there are also no serious restrictions like forced closures on restaurants and retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="76">Most ceremonies were cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay at home until 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the 23 March holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">A number of other countries like Iceland and South Korea also managed to contain the disease by following random contact, by imposing internal travel restrictions, inspections, and quarantine, but the rate of flooding or flooding was low.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that in relation to the number of deaths, the mortality rate in countries that have conducted many tests may be the reason these countries are better able to identify people who have only little or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to 16 laboratories of the World Health Organization (WHO) for testing approval.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the client's 16 laboratories, 7 are based in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the following chart, the column "positive as a% of the examination" is influenced by the country's examination policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country that only examines people referred to hospitals has a positive percentage of tests compared to the country where all people are examined, whether their people have symptoms or not, but other things are equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Total cases of coronavirus virus infection (COVID-19) rapidly spread in the European Union / European Economic Area and Britain, 1 January to 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">Cases of coronavirus aggregate disease (COVID-19) show similar incidents in European Union / European Economic Area countries and the UK which certifies that, while at various stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 outbreak spreads rapidly in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and care units should increase their preparedness for an increase in COVID-19 patients who will need medical care and particularly intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of December 31,2019, an unknown epidemiological case of sanomonia was reported in Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 20 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the new krona virus to the reported factor now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome krona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been designated Crohn's Virus Disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">The evidence so far is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have fewer diseases, for example, shorter breathing disorders with or without breast implants, and many are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Ca 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops a very serious illness that requires a bed in a hospital while the remaining 6% of cases experience a serious illness that requires intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The death toll of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we assess the overall incidence of COVID-19 in every European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) country and the UK and compare it to Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK in Italy during January 31- 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">COVID-19 cases in England and European Union / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, COVID-19 was spread geographically and the COVID-19 outbreak dynamic in the world currently follows the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11,2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 disease as a global outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Europe on March 5 Spiteri et al, according to the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on January 24,2020 in returnees from France to Hubei, China, and Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15,2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU / EEA countries and the UK, while between December 31,2019 and this date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, in 17,750 cases only 1,441 deaths were reported from Italy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Getting a total number of CoVID-19 cases plus incidents</seg>
<seg id="19">At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the confirmed case of COVID-19 is counted in every country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and local health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) daily at 8:00 am.</seg>
<seg id="20">This data is used to assess COVID-19 incidents in the EU / EEA and the UK, and it is compared to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a sign of the widespread outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total incidence of COVID-19 cases 14 days downstream, thereby taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">We presented the total number of confirmed cases of each country on March 15 2020 at 8:00 pm compared with Italy for the period January 31 to March 15 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom and European Union / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="24">In 14 days this process the majority of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK were generally followed by Hubei Province (China) (Shape 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then grew to around February 28 2020 (supplemental supplements).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is often caused by a rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU / EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in COVID-19 (complementary substance) overall cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in Italy compared to this in EV / EEA countries and the UK for the Jan. 31 -15 March 2020 period.</seg>
<seg id="28">It points out that, at 8pm on March 15, 15 other EU / EEA countries and the UK had reported similar cases with Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">The intensity observed in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggests that outbreaks of the disease in all countries are progressing perilously.</seg>
<seg id="31">Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, differences in national public health reactions, and possibly different case definitions in countries, different protocols for selecting patients and follow-up examinations that should have been tested for COVID-19 approval.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these regions have already reached their highest capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">Documentation of intervention data in COVID-19 cases in the hospital and / or tenancy care unit is currently available at the EU / EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the data has not been shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they must be systematically collected to complete current supervision documents / evidence focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 11-2010 showed a huge difference in the availability of focused care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with beds in Germany ranging from 29.2 in Portugal to 4.2 in the top 100,000 population.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12 - 2010 care and medium care beds are 12.5 per 100,000 population).</seg>
<seg id="37">Modeling scenarios related to sanitation of health care capacity, with each EU / EEA country estimated and beds in UK hospitals having COVID-19 incidents exceeding the capacity of concentrated care beds &gt; 90% risk, were presented in the sixth ECDC rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="38">As cases have so far been clustered in some regions in the EU / EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care units usually determine the local captive population, information about cases and care beds should best be provided in the name of field units. Level 2 for statistics (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Countries, hospitals and care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuous social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need medical care, and particularly intensive care, as it happens in the affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a fast, active and versatile approach is necessary to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a skilled condition to a reduced method, because the anticipated rapid increase in numbers of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to design, accept and implement their own reflections if they do not implement them in advance of time.</seg>
<seg id="42">An accelerated risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the global outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a short window of opportunity whereby countries are more likely to increase their control efforts to stabilize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the stress of health care.</seg>
<seg id="44">Failing this, health systems in other EU / EEA countries are likely to face an increasing number of patients who need in-depth care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Zoological origin of human krona viruses / resources</seg>
<seg id="2">Variation and adaptation have coincided for thousands of years with the Krona virus (covs) and their host, which includes humans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to 2003, two human (covs) HCoVs were identified as the cause of a small disease, such as typical cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been meted out to indicate how destructive and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the end of 2019, Kai's emergence from SARS-CoV-2 in central China turned covs into a remarkable place and surprised us with her high transmission side but reduced her mental illness compared to her sister's SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">The HCoV infection is zonosis and understanding the zoological origin of HCoVs will serve us well.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many HCoVs originate from shopkeepers where they are endangered.</seg>
<seg id="8">A medium-sized deposit host of some HCoVs has also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identifying an animal host has a direct effect on preventing human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigating CoV - host interactions in animals may also gain an important perspective on CoV pathogen disease in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we present a general overview of existing knowledge on seven HCoVs, with a focus on their detection history and the origins of their zones and reinforcement transfers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Crucially, we compare different HCoV viruses with a combination of virus evolution and genome.</seg>
<seg id="13">Current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease has been discussed in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="14">Additionally, the needs of a successful host and the evolutionary effects of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Karuna virus (covs) belongs to the Karuna virus family, which has a group of positive, positive feelings, only worldwide RNA viruses.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes in the group of RNA viruses and are called "covs" due to morphology like crown under an electric microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, covs have non-cutting-edge genomes that share the same arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large wide questionnaire open readings frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designed nsp1 ~ 16</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structural proteins, including spark (S), lifeguard (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N)</seg>
<seg id="21">A series of related access proteins are encrypted by different numbers of covs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on variation in protein settings, covs are classified into four genres (alphabet, bat-CoV, gem-CoV and Delta CoV), in which the bata-CoV genre has multiple HCoV and is divided into four strands (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Monetary genetic evidence has shown that shoppers and mice act as the source of many alpha-coVs and beta covs genes, while birds are the main stocks of gamma - covs and delta - covs.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, covs have consistently exceeded such barriers and some have been raised as critical human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, seven human (covs) HCoVs have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 Alpha covs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five beta covs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome krona virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause common symptoms, such as common colds and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly contagious, causing a low respiratory system infection in relatively few patients with a high chance of developing a high respiratory system infection.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first HCoV-229E patient, B814, was separated from the gross exclusion of common cold diseases in the mid-1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, much of the data has been gathered through extensive studies in HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, the concept was widely accepted that being impaired with HCoVs is usually harmless until SARS occurs.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS epidemic erupted in 2003, the deadliest in current history, and infected more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% accidental cases.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) disease caused continuous devastation in the Arab peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 2019 novel (HCoV) 2019-nCoV, which was later replaced as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing Crohn virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91 000 people between March 3,2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm is sounding and the world should be prepared for the next outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from sharks, mice or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">The evidence line supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from shopkeepers, where viruses are well adapted and are non-disease but show great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 disease presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the origins of HCoVs zones provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting the fermentation of species.</seg>
<seg id="41">This may make it easier to guide or search for SARS-CoV-2 stocks, intermediate and extended animal hosts (guns), which have important signs in preventing future spillovers.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review we present the origin of zonotic, reinforced transmission and disease disorders of HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="43">Specifically, we address and discuss the common topic that parental viruses of HCoVs are particularly incurable in their natural resources host but become ill after reinforced transmission to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">We also look at the evolutionary state of HCoV in which increased transmission ability often comes with reduced disease.</seg>
<seg id="45">The ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal covs have been known since the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E B814 was inhaled from the nose of patients who had normal person disease, various covs were isolated in various diseased animals, including feral birds, mouse, cow, chain, cat and dog.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the past decades, seven HCoV have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="49">A Brief History of HCoV Discovery in Cronological Settings (Table 1) will be informative and directional.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory disease during 1966, and was later applied to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, bruising, throat pain, fever and cough seen in 10 ~ 20 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the cluster of nerves and subsequent serious aggression in the brains of lung mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 mutation appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which in other parts are not separately separated from mutations with respiratory disease triangle such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed internationally, and they are transmitted during the warm climate during the winter season.</seg>
<seg id="55">Typically, the time for the removal of these two viruses is less than one week, and the nearly 2 weeks of the disease is prolonged / extended.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to a Human Volunteer study, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few immune patients showed severe low inflammation of the respiratory system.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first widely known and epidemiological agent SARS-CoV developed by HCoV in human history, the third HCoV detected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first SARS case was found in Guangdong province of China in late 2002.</seg>
<seg id="60">As a result of SARS, 8,096 cases have been reported with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to high spread, it was estimated that each case develops approximately 4 secondary cases, the duration of acidity ranges from 4 to 7 days and the weight of the virus becomes apparent on the tenth day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS - CoV are initially exposed to myeloma, headache, fever, suffering and disease, followed by dysentery, cough and respiratory distress symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lymphoma, liver / blood function tests, and elevated cranioplasty are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="64">Reducing flu damage, developing epithelial cells and increasing microfibrillation are also seen in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients later require in-depth care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to low respiration, many nerves including stomach aches, liver / chest and kidneys may also be infected with these severe cases, usually with cytokine storms, which may be fatal especially in patients with weak immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of relatives of an index patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was initially found in teenage children, adults and immunized patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">The presence of coriazza, convulsions, fever, and lung mucus is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study in the Netherlands described the isolation pattern of the fundamental virus in an 8-month-old boy's chest.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 has approximately 4.7% of normal respiratory diseases, and its high realities occur in the early heat, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with preventive laryngitis, also known as chrop.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with typhoid and lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to the association obtained samples and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to have been associated with acute asymmetric disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, which caused minor respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All these four socially acquired HCoV have become well common in humans and are generally less likely to cause more inflammatory diseases, while cases have been caused by unknown exposure as HCoV-NL63 occurs in more viral subtypes of diseases. It has recently been reported that shorter respiratory tract infections occur in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Generally, when these HCoVs gain the capability to transmit efficiently and keep themselves constantly in humans, they also become less dangerous or ill.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS - CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pattern and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="82">While most of the laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases of imports sometimes reported to close contact with the second end have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary disease occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">Clinical expressions of MERS are similar to SARS, characterized by advanced acute pattern.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is very special for Mers in diseases caused by HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients have stomach aches, such as diarrhea and inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14,2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with 34.4% higher cases, making Mers-CoV the most deadly virus known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From mid-December 2019 to last, clusters of pneumonia patients linked to SARS - CoV - 2 disease were found in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization declared an ongoing respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 31,2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of raw / unconfirmed death cases.</seg>
<seg id="91">Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory illnesses like CoV and MERS-CoV, which are prescribed as fever, cough and dysentery.</seg>
<seg id="93">Acids were also observed in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="94">Samples are one of the most severe symptoms and can develop severe acute respiratory syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 82% highly versatile due to high nucleotide sequence molecules, they are clustered in different branches of philosophical trees.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a minor cancer patient but is more transmittable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Asymmetric issues infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">The comparison and variation of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs showed many profit differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the duration of oncology and HCoV infection is very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 tracks the general condition of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms exists between SARS-CoV and four socially acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show shapes that are more common during infection with HCoVs taken by society, including presenting unspecified, moderate or even non-existent symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting ways to characterize both HCoVs and SARS-CoV acquired by society.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than the minimum HCoV received by society.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passage in humans as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.</seg>
<seg id="107">Eventually, unlike other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, fermentation of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as clarified by future studies in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may explain seasonal as in the cases of HCoVs obtained by the association.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the SARS-CoV-2 form will be effective for the final destination of current COVID-19 after passing through humans including this transmission, disease and persistent spread.</seg>
<seg id="111">Four small community-acquired HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms are well applied in humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptability to these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans. And people who have developed severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="115">To make this happen, HCoVs should sufficiently repeat in humans to allow adaptive changes to combat host limitation factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, as the SARS-CoV-2 disease continues and as long as people are infected, there is a greater chance that it will become completely familiar to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well known, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop by convulsions or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four of society's most accomplished covs float in the human population, becoming common cold in immune subjects.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal stocks.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, high cancer - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well accepted in humans and their transmission cannot continue in humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to preserve and spread their biochemical resources and seize the opportunity to develop suspicious human targets. Potentially through one or more medium and advanced hosting methods.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has a shape similar to both the SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the four communities acquired by HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is highly leveraged like HCoVs obtained by the association, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is less pathogen / disease than community-acquired HCoVs and less disease than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a host of stocks or intermediate animals.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the native sources of HCoVs animals, it would serve us well to discuss the evolution of HCoVs, natural resources, medium- and extinct host definitions and characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="127">An animal serves as the evolutionary host of HCoV if it is related to a close parent who shares a high levels of nucleotide sequencing.</seg>
<seg id="128">The elderly virus is often well known in this host and is non-infectious.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, Reservoir Hosting maintains HCoV continuously and for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host has a natural disease and is a natural host of HCoV or as a parent of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV is introduced to the new host before its introduction to or around humans, it does not apply well to the new host and is often ill.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a zoological source of human infection and play a role in transmitting it through virus and then transmitting it to humans by expanding the amount of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can carry a deadly end infection if it is unable to maintain its transmission in the middle host.</seg>
<seg id="134">In contrast, HCoVs can coordinate with intermediate hosting and even create long-term infections.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, intermediate hosting is hosted by natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="136">Given the epidemiological data it has demonstrated that the SARS index case has a history of contact with animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequently research from SARS-CoV IgG indicated that pet traders have higher anti-SARS rates than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In live animal markets, maize civets (pigma larvata) and raccoon dogs were first identified to carry SARS-CoV - such viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly supported by the fact that there was no further SARS report after killing all the surfers in the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, it has been reported that maize cultivated from wildlife or farms was largely negative for SARS-CoV without reaching livestock markets, suggesting that maize populations may host only moderate but not cov- SARS natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="141">Remarkably, since 80% of different animals in Guangdong markets have anti-SARS - CoV antibodies, the possibility that smaller species may also serve as a host of moderate SARS-CoV outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="142">It all seems to host the end of SARS-CoV deaths.</seg>
<seg id="143">A closely related CoV evening show looking for a natural host of SARS-CoV, called SARS Related Reynolds CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horseshoe shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="144">These shopkeepers are positive for SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequencing and SARS-CoV antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and nucleotide covs share the 92-88 nucleotide sequencing molecule with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have developed the basis for a new concept that exactly hosts human-made human corals.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several SARS-type corona viruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in evening appearances, but with the exception of one virus designated as WIV1 no longer can be isolated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The human encephalitis converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor or meningitis.</seg>
<seg id="149">Evening appearances were examined in WIV1 with no targeted instances of the virus entering the cell using evening urine, particles, and human ACE2 as a monitor.</seg>
<seg id="150">It is noteworthy that the serum or flavor of SARS patients was able to inhibit WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV component in evening showers, with 95% nucleotide range similarities.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although there are many similarities between these two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not a close SARS-CoV virus and evening urine does not host a close SARS-CoV guard.</seg>
<seg id="153">Philosophical Analysis and Analysis MERS-CoV classifies evening appearance CoV-HKU4 and evening appearance CoV-HKU5 in the same group.</seg>
<seg id="154">Evening performers CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV both use the same host recipient for viral insertion, diptidal peptides 4 (DPP4).</seg>
<seg id="155">RNA - A series of MERS-CoV related RNA polymers known philosophically in Europe and Africa are close to the same type of evening apparel beta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="156">Until now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild evening scenes.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV and its closest relative evening appearance CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide range similarities.</seg>
<seg id="158">So the evening show probably won't host a closely guarded MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arab tears have positive consequences for MERS-CoV special inhibitor antibodies, the same as in many African countries as the tears of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="160">Exactly the same lifesaving MERS-CoV with the virus found in humans has been isolated from the nose fluid of Arab tourists, according to the lawsuit, which asserts that tourists are the main guardians of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth mentioning that for the experiment the tears infected with MERS-CoV were generally visible but the spread of the virus was widespread.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth mentioning that infected tears not only spread the viruses through respiratory tract but also through the mouth - mouth, which is also the main way of spreading the virus in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, questions remain as to why many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of any contact with tears prior to the beginning of the cause, apparently no human transmission or ratio to unknown pathways of transmission that involve unidentified animals that have MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 is separated from the Reynolds Hornets evening urine with evening urine CoV RaTG13 resembling 96.2% nucleotide.</seg>
<seg id="165">In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the range discrepancy between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is greater for determining a birth relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">This means that evening performers may not host any SARS-CoV-2 distance guards unless in the future almost exactly the same evening performers are found to have the virus.</seg>
<seg id="167">Potentially, the SARS-CoV-2 medium host animals should have been purchased at the Henan Marine Food Wholesale Market and any yeast between dead wildlife, depending on where most of the initial cases of COVID-19 were linked, which is an indication of the potential incidence of transmission from animals to humans.</seg>
<seg id="168">A number of recent studies based on the metagenomic range have concluded that at-risk smaller animals, known as mammalian sisters, may also have mammalian beta-CoVs that are associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These genomes of the new penguin CoV have a combined range of 85-92% nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are similarly very closely related to RaTG13 which is roughly 90% similar to the nucleotide range.</seg>
<seg id="171">They collect viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in two sub- household groups, of which one has a very similar receptor mixing area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, which is 97.4% similar to the amino acid range.</seg>
<seg id="172">Quite differently, the SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13, RBD are very different, although have genome-wide molecular range sizes.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on diseased males also reported finding viral infections from the disease, which is similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">In this study, different pathways of integration were used to manually produce trivial genome range with the combination having a complete - length of approximately 86.3% of the viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">We can't even ignore the contention that the sister is one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host animals.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the distinct range between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 linked to beta-CoVs at present, there is no direct supportive evidence of origin between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 which are associated with beta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="178">The path of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, mammals and other animals has not been found yet.</seg>
<seg id="179">While a high degree of hooliganism has been found in RBD cells between SARS-CoV-2 and mouse sister, SARS-CoV-2 has a combination of beta-CoVs, a high genome-wide range between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly anticipated that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD is due to the growth of preferential intermediate integration.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another proposal then bars the reproduction of mammalian SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV in third wild animal species and between RaTG13.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a developer of growth power, back production among beta-CoVs is much wider.</seg>
<seg id="183">Judgment on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is far away.</seg>
<seg id="184">Besides this, HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 animal origins have also been studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been found from covs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 myeloma viruses have been found in the family of mice.</seg>
<seg id="186">It has been reported that the Garment CoV named ARCoV. 2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three colors of North America showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically associated with another drunk CoV, whose name is Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, found in Ghana, while also suspected of being a medieval host of the Sears family.</seg>
<seg id="188">To clarify, a summary of current available information about the origin of HCoVs is in table 1 format and 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Historically, psychological analyses have provided evidence for evidence of transmission of HCoVs between animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">When HCoV-OC43 came to humans from domestic animals around 1890, respiratory infections were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of HCoV-229E transmission between animals has little clarity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">There is an Alpha-CoV among these.</seg>
<seg id="194">A number of different evidence supports evidence of transmission of viruses between animals and humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans may not have had contact with alpaca whales in the environmental area.</seg>
<seg id="196">However, humans have a close relationship with Alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, there are various HCoV-229E related to alpha-CoVs and do not cause disease in the alpha-CoVs, while alpha-CoV has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">As a result, alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, it cannot be ignored that alpha-229E takes alpha-CoV from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">Indeed, smoking is a direct source of human disease viruses including mad dog virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that drugs may be transmitted directly to HCoV-229E humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while alpha-CoVs act as the source of HCoV-229E inheritance, alpha-goers and tears of a bud may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as their case with MERS-CoV shows.</seg>
<seg id="203">The MERS-CoV is a great example of the spread between animals from a shoe to tears and a shoe to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The origin of MERS-CoV growth has been identified in the first phase and has been supported in recent findings.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is clear that how to spread between vertebrate pieces and animals is a possible source of viruses between animals.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long life, very crowded, close social relations and powerful flight capability are all supportive situations where the clothes are the proper spread of virus.</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has moved to tears of a boom over the decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It is well habited by these animals which have been transformed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural source.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very low levels of disease and keeps a low rate of change in these animals.</seg>
<seg id="210">This irregular transmission to humans is an incident and humans are hosting the end of MERS-CoV because the spread cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike tears in transmitting the MERS-CoV, the sister's share, if any, is otherwise in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, sister beta-CoVs are highly infectious in mouse doses.</seg>
<seg id="213">In the case of SARS-CoV to the families of cats, they may be a host of beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, various evidence of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should not be accepted or accepted.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, there may be a similar host source of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus near SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">People may have similar environmental partnerships with whales through cashew or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, maize feed may be an increasingly moderate host to which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="218">People are infected with this virus by eating cashews and hungry meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many animals may be weak against SARS-CoV-2, including households.</seg>
<seg id="220">A survey of households and wild animals is necessary for antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as stated above, may have occurred in third animals in the reproduction and habitat of SARS-CoV-2 which is connected to both drinking and eating dishes.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Apart from different types of host animals, virtually three important reasons for facilitating the transfer of covs to animals are also important.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, the RNA returns to production at their highest conversion rate.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to a string of other RNA viruses, the estimated change rate of covs may be from "medium" to "high" levels, and the average change rate is ~ 10-4 per 2 area per year, and it depends on the CoV phase of the new host.</seg>
<seg id="226">Covs contain the correction of eczorbonycalories, resulting in a high degree of change and decrease or no continuity.</seg>
<seg id="227">Remarkably, the nucleotide analogue radicaliser is known to prevent the reproduction of CoV through this eczorbonicalisation and RNA-related RNA polymers.</seg>
<seg id="228">Redditor is very encouraged by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 practices to be clinically tested.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the rate of change for covs compared to their host is nearly one million times greater.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the rate of change increases when covs aren't habiting the host well.</seg>
<seg id="231">A higher rate of change compared to SARS-CoV, it is observed that the SARS-CoV-2 change rate is lower, which means a higher degree of habitat with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It may have been habited by a host similar to humans before.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant for MERS-CoV, which is well habited by the tears of a Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="234">Theoretically, it is impossible that genetic change will make vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-virus more effective immediately.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the larger RNA genome in covs uses greater flexibility in genome change and reverse synthesis, therefore increasing the joint - growth intensity between animals, is useful for the emergence of new covs when the condition is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="236">This supports 3 'coded open reading frames and more specific proteins operating at the end of the genome.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, covs convert unorganized and reusable templates during RNA reproduction through a specific "prescription options" mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="238">In a host that serves as a mixed dish, the string change occurs frequently during the RNA recording of the CoV.</seg>
<seg id="239">Similar full-length and sub-genomic RNA rings at higher levels may be recombined to produce new CoV rings.</seg>
<seg id="240">Evidence of natural reproduction synthesis has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coV mammals such as succulent SL-CoV and succulent CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-hosting relations related to shipping</seg>
<seg id="242">Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, the transmission between animals is another important factor in viral contact with the host recipient.</seg>
<seg id="243">Therefore, the back combination of SARS-CoV was taken as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive options during transmission incidents between animals.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on the analysis of comparisons between human and cat SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV, it is thought that in different households, especially the S protein passes through rapid habitat changes in RBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">Generally, a CoV's S protein RBD interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected powerfully by the host's antibiotic response.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD in patches of S1 is 318th to 510th amino acids connected to human ACE2 and fellow recipients for getting inside the virus.</seg>
<seg id="247">For SARS-CoV, RBD can identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including dancers, cats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to spread between animals.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, it has been observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD were different from human and wild cats and 4 of them were located in a reception-connecting scheme to interact with ACE2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="249">The cat SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T changes in its RBD, which may increase the interest of spike protein connections with the recipient of human ACE2.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, changes in both of these amino acids may be important for curing habitat with humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth mentioning that SARS-CoV-2 has similar combined cellular receptors with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that its interest in connecting the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study of cryo-EM has shown a higher rate of symptoms from 10 to 20, as long as it is between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It will also be interesting to find out if any of the companion recipients may be needed to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2 but with another part of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many HCoV recipients, such as HCoV-229E for amino peptides N, and 9-O-isotelitic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">After spreading between animals from their animal host, they may also be considered to make a successful habit of these covs.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the resulting spread of HCoVs between animals is also governed by another host requirement and restrictive practices.</seg>
<seg id="259">The difference of these host proteins between HCoVs such as succulents, tears of a bud, mice, humans and natural resources couples may be an obstacle to spread between animals.</seg>
<seg id="260">HCoVs for successful spread between animals must pass the hosting requirement and eliminate the causes of host restriction.</seg>
<seg id="261">Therefore, molecular factors in this important area of virus-host communication still need to be identified and explained.</seg>
<seg id="262">It may be useful to use sophisticated CRISPR technologies to test genome-wide neutrality for a host of SARS-CoV-2 and obstacle causes.</seg>
<seg id="263">Coming to the middle of new HCoVs: Back to the original location</seg>
<seg id="264">Many types of dance covs provide many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">Therefore, succulent HCoVs are the source of gene deposits of HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="266">Additionally, rapid change and genetic reversal combination also contribute to the growth of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this series.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, acquiring or losing new protein-coding genes enables it to severely alter viral pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among SARS-CoV companion proteins, it is thought that ORF8 is important to habit humans, as viruses related to SARS-CoV have been curbed but have been found to inject various ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">It contains a 29-nucleotide characteristic of SARS-CoVs found in distinct viruses of human infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="270">This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a habitual change in encouraging hosting conversion.</seg>
<seg id="271">Besides, the SARS-CoV has a history of possibly returning combinations whose families are alpha and gem-coVs, where the RNA forced smaller areas of RNA polymers to be reunited.</seg>
<seg id="272">Back combination locations are also known in nsp9, driverless nsp10, and parts of nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV infectious disease has experienced a back combination among different families, which occurred in the tears of a Facebook in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">Besides, the incidence of back combination of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has also been observed in other HCoVs, these include HCoVs with another covs of the animal gliding back into their unnatural composition genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial preferences may contribute untargeted to the transformation of viral genomes, resulting in a large number of preferred pressures, such as the release of viruses by the host safety system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="277">While complete ORF4 may be seen in viruses related to HCoV-229E, the imaging of alpha-alpha-CoV indicates an individual nucleus, resulting in a change.</seg>
<seg id="278">As a result, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressures on their household stocks.</seg>
<seg id="279">Disease without symptoms or rumors of low symptoms were found when rabbits were infected with covs, indicating a common habit between covs and rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="280">It seems that the dancing has been habited automatically and physiologically with the covs.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, the side effects in swelling reaction activity actively reduces the activation of pathogens by covs.</seg>
<seg id="282">Besides this, the activity of natural killing cells in chapters is prevented due to the above activity of natural killing cell receptor NKG2 / CD94 and the prevention of low - core equivalent I degree molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">Additionally, high reaction oxygen types (ROS) produced due to high metabolic activity of the waves may both prevent the return of the CoV and the correct effects by aerobonicles, thus providing a menopausal strain for production when the highly infectious virus is transmitted to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="284">Many diseased CoV viruses may change with back synthesis, and take new proteins or protein forms to habit the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">Covs are inpatient in their host reserves such as sneakers and tears or cause minor illness.</seg>
<seg id="287">They quickly reproduce without showing a powerful response to the host safety system.</seg>
<seg id="288">Therefore, there is a mystery as to why unsymptoms can be seen and what causes severe cases of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to high safety response and cytokine starvation, as long as the safety response is strong, lung loss also increases.</seg>
<seg id="290">In other words, the safety response in unsymptoms is separated from the reproduction of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="291">A similar safety response separation strategy may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="292">The reaction of entrants in chapters is particularly powerful.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, giving type I antennas at the early stage of human infection in SARS-CoV-2 should be useful.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of NLRP3 encephaloma in droplets has side effects.</seg>
<seg id="295">With this argument, inhibiting NLRP3 inhalation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general view that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred.</seg>
<seg id="297">While it has been found that a drip beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide similarities with SARS-CoV, there is also a drip bat-CoV that shares a 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">While cats and other animals have been found in markets that have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, a close intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">It has been found that sister beta-CoVs are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that sister beta-CoVs may be as intermediate hosts or sister beta-CoVs may contribute to gene mutations as a result of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or coerced by a human.</seg>
<seg id="301">Covs have once again returned to common due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of covs in animals and other animals has changed our understanding of the transfer of HCoVs to humans and the importance of stocks and animal mammals in animals.</seg>
<seg id="303">General evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the main umbrella gear and spread to humans through intermediate couplings.</seg>
<seg id="304">Depending on how the SARS-CoV virus mutates in markets between humans and cats, the closure of wet markets and the death of cats could have effectively eliminated the SARS infection.</seg>
<seg id="305">Based on the same argument, maize meals should be marketed with dairy products to prevent the spread of the animal, since maize meal beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of links have been found.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 spreads to humans through flocks or other animals should be clarified in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in the tears of a boot.</seg>
<seg id="308">These seafood serve as a major source of transportation as well as the central source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local people.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all avenues to control MERS, as was done in China's wet markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">To prevent the spread of MERS, a verbal approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV alongside other steps of spreading control for tears.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we are unable to eliminate the virus, new genotype may arise and spread.</seg>
<seg id="313">There are many types of covs in wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="314">Especially the dancing covs have many varieties with animal pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities to transform and recombine these animal covs, resulting in the emergence of new covs that are more prevalent in the future and / or are marginalized in humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">The cultivation of eating wild animals in some places of China should be avoided to reduce the relationship between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">A preparedness and response plan should be developed for the problems of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural resources for as long as they have the opportunity to spread.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although squirrels have many forms that help spread viruses, the chance of humans interacting with squirrels and other wild animals may be reduced if people have the knowledge to stay away from them.</seg>
<seg id="321">Continuous surveillance from animals is necessary to gain awareness of the covs environment and the natural environment of the corbo, which will be helpful in preventing the animal from spreading to humans in the future.</seg>
<seg id="322">As a result, the more effective way for humans to prevent animal viruses is to remove animal viruses from the environmental area of natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="323">A number of pieces in the mystery of the SARS-CoV-2 animal umbrella are still missing.</seg>
<seg id="324">Firstly, if the disease spreads to SARS-CoV-2 mammals, it would be interesting to see if under any circumstances the mammals and mammals may share the same environmental area.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if alcohol is directly involved in spreading to humans, it should be noted how humans come into contact with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third animal acts as a native medieval host, how it interacts with various animals including humans, whales and mammals, it should be clear.</seg>
<seg id="327">As a result, since many animals, including domestic animals, may be weak against SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental dissemination should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a slave, a sister or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or mosquito-borne viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural household in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continuous research in this field will explain the growth pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control results of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
