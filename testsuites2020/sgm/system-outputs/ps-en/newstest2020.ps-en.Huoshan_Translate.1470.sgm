<seg id="1">B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to help track a relationship in response to the 2019-20 Corona virus disease, for example, the process of identifying individuals ("relationships") who may have been in contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">In some areas and powers, various apps were created or offered with the official support of governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several frameworks have been developed to create a communication tracking app.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems that are built based on tracking the geographical location of app users.</seg>
<seg id="5">A small number of resistant alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user can be closely inserted into other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support these apps based on Bluetooth to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to see if they were but not in contact with people who have Covid-19 disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">The app is used in more than 200 cities across China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.</seg>
<seg id="9">The app was developed by the local IT community, which is published as a free resource and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "StopKorona!" That determines contact with potential patients and provides a quick response to health care officials.</seg>
<seg id="10">This app has been developed by Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="11">Until 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 April, the government said the contact tracking app is in the final stage of development, and will be available within a few weeks. A similar app is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app in Moscow for patients who are infected with Covid-19 disease, and has been developed in such a way to ensure they don't go out of the house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed a number of potential practical problems in app-based systems, including the positive outcomes of those errors and the potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small portion of the population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add Coronavirus-related apps to the Apple Store. This has limited them only to "official" or, in other words, to popular organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy campaigners expressed their concern about the effects of mass surveillance using Coronavirus apps, especially about whether the established surveillance infrastructure to combat the Coronavirus plague would be eliminated when this threat ended.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The above mentioned organizations announced eight requirements for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Supervision should be "legal, mandatory and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">The extension of supervision and supervision should consist of termination clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">The use of data will be limited to Quad-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Information security and uncertainty should be protected and protected based on evidence;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital monitoring should prevent discrimination and edge-to-edge;</seg>
<seg id="25">The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in law;</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to respond to abuse, there must be protections against abuse and the rights of citizens;</seg>
<seg id="27">Meaningful participation is required by all "relevant studies," including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Correspondent Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Seven Greenzine Reporters) (RSF) also published checklists.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google / Apple is considering the proposed plan to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from its device's operating systems when it is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of the app, which eliminated the need to download the app and has the ability to prevent tracking.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all centralized systems having centralized servers are required to have access to private location data; a number of privacy security systems have been built that centralized servers use only for internal connections (see section below).</seg>
<seg id="33">In South Korea, a system without an app was used to perform contact tracking.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a specialized app, the system collected tracking information from various sources including mobile devices tracking data and card transaction data, and combined it to inform potentially ill persons through short messages.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to inform potential individuals of contact finders, the government free public access to location information, which has been allowed to do so due to extensive changes in data privacy laws following the release of MERS in the country.</seg>
<seg id="36">People have access to this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, use central and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until 6 April 2020, no details have yet been published about this.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy protection is an established good idea, with a sufficient amount of literature research dating back to at least 2013. Until 7 April 2020, dozens of groups of experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to get the user closely into other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and does not have a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracking of proximity privacy protection (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these protocols, diagnosable personal information never leaves the device, and all comparisons are done on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The privacy group creates SafePaths in MIT Media Lab when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19, which is a platform for using privacy protection techniques.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is a published research-based platform in March 2020 titled "Apps Gun Rogue: Protecting Personal Privacy in the Plague." Another similar attempt is to build a SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, who is a company developing privacy technologies and was originally also developed at MIT Media Lab.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without agreeing on the privacy of that information.</seg>
<seg id="44">On 5 April 2020, the global coalition of TCN was created by a number of groups that put together around the same approaches and largely extensive protocols aimed at minimizing analysis, and enabling international cooperation in tracking and alert apps that are a key aspect of achieving a wide range of usage goals.</seg>
<seg id="45">On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has liberated the BlueTrace protocol as a free source used by their official government app.</seg>
<seg id="46">On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track connections, which will protect privacy by their claim and will be built based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy protection cryptography.</seg>
<seg id="47">They also published the characteristics of the core technologies used in this system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system is supposed to be implemented in three steps:</seg>
<seg id="49">Launching such tools to enable states to create official tracking apps for privacy protection coronavirus</seg>
<seg id="50">Directly integrating this functionality into iOS and Android's Google and Apple plan to solve the problem of starting and continuing surveillance by first updating the system and later in the same way when the threat ended.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning your hands to clean dust, oils, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Continuously washing hands with soap at "important moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhoea and digestion, which are transmitted from hands to mouth by stool substances.</seg>
<seg id="3">People may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (such as, mucous membranes).</seg>
<seg id="4">The five sensitive times a day during which it is important to wash hands with soap are as follows: Before and after defecation relief, after cleaning the bottom parts of the baby or changing the pumper, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is no water or soap, hands can also be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following situations:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before preparing food, during and after it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after patient care.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or cleaning up children who have relieved the necessity.</seg>
<seg id="9">After burning the nose, coughing or pranking.</seg>
<seg id="10">After involvement with livestock, animal feed, or animal waste.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hands-on medical hygiene refers to hygiene habits related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand washing before regulating medication or medical attention can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main health purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">This work is especially necessary for people who touch food or work in the medical field, but also is an important practice for all people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reduced spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhea; reduced respiratory diseases;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reducing the mortality rate of children at birth in homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that optimized hand washing habits may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, the mortality rate of children related to respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can decrease by introducing simple habit changes, such as washing hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple practice can cause an around 50% reduction in mortality rates from these diseases.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ways that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea cases by nearly three-quarters, and this is associated with the provision of clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">A 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea can be associated with soap washing hands. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive method to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if this practice is automatically carried out in homes, schools and communities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, which is a major part of ARI, is the primary cause of death among children under the age of five, taking the lives of around 1.8 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to UNICEF, washing hands before eating and after using the toilet can save the lives of more people than any vaccine or medical method, and can reduce the rate of deaths of half of people due to diarrhea and respiratory infections by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hand washing is often associated with other sanitation methods as part of the Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH) program.</seg>
<seg id="26">The washing of the hands also protects against marrow giants that are transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only small weed effect of hand washing is that washing the hands repeatedly can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive washing of the hands may cause irritation, a skin picking condition known as hand eczema or hand pharmaceuticals, which is especially common among health care workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Repeated washing of the hands is also known as a symptom of compulsive vascular disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">There are five important times during the day during which washing hands with soap is important in reducing the transmission of diseases from stool substances to mouth: After using the toilet (to relieve empty urine or defecation), after cleaning the bottom parts of the baby (changing the pumper), before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Other circumstances where the correct hand washing technique should be used to prevent disease transmission such as before and after treatment of a cut or injury; after burning the prange, cough and nose; after animal waste or handling of animals; and after touching the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries, the level of hand washing with soap is very low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the rate in Saudi Arabia was the highest 97 percent; the average in the United States is nearly 77 percent; and the lowest in China, namely 23 percent. Multiple habit change methods are currently available to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Mass hand washing for school children at scheduled times of the day</seg>
<seg id="34">The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a level of action to promote children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">Treating worms twice a year, alongside washing their hands with soap, brushing their teeth daily with fluoride are the main objectives of this national programme.</seg>
<seg id="36">The program is also successfully implemented in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent in water.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce inhibitors in solutions, and increase solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone is not effective in the purity of the skin because oils and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">Proper water flow only helps with cleanliness.</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, due to its reusable property, may protect bacteria obtained from previous uses.</seg>
<seg id="42">A number of few studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that the possibility of this transfer is very rare because the bacteria are cleaned with soap foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">The CDC still says "the use of liquid soap by many individuals for clean control of hands-on contact is best."</seg>
<seg id="44">Anti-antibacterial soap has been largely promoted among people with knowledge about health.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that the used antibiotic or non-antibiotic drugs are best suited for an antibiotic-resistant organism in nature.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, anti-antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial substance like tricyclone, which has an extensive list of organism-resistant types.</seg>
<seg id="47">So if antibiotic-resistant types for antibacterial soaps are not chosen, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to the surfactant and skin protective substances, as a pH regulator, the complex formula like anti-antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin conditions (Elo Vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract) may contain acid acidity (acetic acid, skerback acid, lactic acid). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicates that simple soap in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands is as effective as</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water that is suitable for washing hands is not warm enough to kill the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">The bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 ° C).</seg>
<seg id="51">But in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria, hot soap-containing water is more effective than cold soap-containing water.</seg>
<seg id="52">Contrary to popular beliefs, scientific research has shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing germline pressure on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="53">Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand purification substance without water.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand alcohol without water found popularity as a purity substance (also known as alcohol hands solo, hands solo antiseptic, or hands sanitizer).</seg>
<seg id="55">Most depend on isopropylene alcohol or ethanol combined with thick substances in the gel such as carboomers (acrylic acid polymer), or hemocrats such as glycerine in the liquid, or foam to make it easier to use and reduce the effects of alcohol drying.</seg>
<seg id="56">The addition of hydrogen peroxide adsorption fluid further increases the anti-antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing antibacteria.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol-containing snitzer bacteria, multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and kill fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Alcohol-containing sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of the bacteria 30 seconds after hitting on the hands (a decrease of 3.5 log, equivalent to a decrease of 35 dc bell) and 1 minute after hitting on the hands kill 99.99% of the bacteria to 99.999% (a decrease of 4 to 5 log). Hands sanitizers are highly effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol-containing sanitizers are completely ineffective against norovirus (or norovirus) type viruses that are the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. There should be enough antiseptic or alcohol on the hands to cover both hands well.</seg>
<seg id="60">On the front and back of the hands and in the middle of all the fingers and until the end the sanitizer should be found for about 30 seconds so that the liquid, foam or gel can be dried.</seg>
<seg id="61">Finger heads should also wash well, and find them on both sides. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a hands sanitizer, especially when the hands are too dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Much use of these substances depends on their ease of use and quick killing activity against microorganisms, but they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="63">Using a hands-on alcohol-containing sanitizer bar can cause skin dryness without having a softening or moisturizing formula on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="64">The effects of alcohol skin drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and / or other softening substances to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, hands-on alcohol-containing sanitizers containing softening substances cause less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergent.</seg>
<seg id="66">Susceptibility to contact dermatitis, contact of urethicaria syndrome or severe susceptibility to alcohol or hands wrapping occurs less.</seg>
<seg id="67">A low tendency to stimulate itching with dermatitis has become significant compared to washing hands with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">In addition to their effectiveness, the material without water does not clean organic material from the hands, but simply makes it anti-inflammatory.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is also the reason that hand sanitizers in preventing the spread of multiple pathogens are not as effective as soap and water, since pathogens still remain on their hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of clean hands sanitizers from alcohol depends heavily on the ingredients and texture, and historically has been used less than alcohol and sucking alcohol on the hands.</seg>
<seg id="71">Recently, the formulations that use benzalconium chloride have shown that unlike alcohol, the antimicrobial activity continues and increases after use, and its effectiveness has decreased since recurring use, which may be due to persistent negative reactions on the skin.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or dust.</seg>
<seg id="73">Ash or dust may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase it instead of reducing the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="75">Unlike soap, ashes are also an anti-inflammatory substance because in combination with water, an alkali solution from them is formed.</seg>
<seg id="76">The World Health Organization has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct hand washing technique proposed by the United States Center for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission has the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="78">Touch your hands with hot or cold running water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because the corrosive water in the bowl may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="80">Give the back parts of the hands, including the middle parts of the fingers and the bottom parts of the nails to the hands with enough soap and rubbing.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research has shown that people want to wash their hands very well when washing their hands alone with soap instead of washing their hands with water.</seg>
<seg id="82">Find it for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Scraping creates a cabin, which helps to remove microbes from the skin, and removes more microbes from scraping for longer periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash it well under running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Can be contaminated again by washing hands in the bowl.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry hands with a clean handle or hold them to an air drying machine.</seg>
<seg id="87">The bottom and moist hands can be easily re-polluted. The most common remaining places of the hand are the bottom finger, the wrist, the places between the fingers and the bottom of the finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and beaten polishing of nails may lead to microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">To protect hands from dryness is often recommended as a moisturizer lotion; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of disease.</seg>
<seg id="90">In developing countries, where tap water and / or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be created to make it easier to wash hands, for example, draining water from hanging drums or pumpkins that have a suitable hole and / or using aerosols as needed. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are then water maintenance solutions, such as "tapped drums or hanging drums" and other low cost options.</seg>
<seg id="91">Tippy Taps (tippy-tap) or rolled bushes are a kind of simple technology in which a container is rolled over a rope, and the moving stick by the foot draws a small amount of water on the hands and there is also soap alongside it.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effectively drying hands is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some discussion on the most effective type of drying in public toilets.</seg>
<seg id="93">Large-scale research suggests that paperwork which is found in many toilets is more healthy than hand-drying electrical machines.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, a study was conducted by West Munster University of London, which was financially supported by the paper manufacturing industry called the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene proposed by paperwork, hot air hands driver and other advanced hands-on jet air drivers.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing hands and drying hands with a warm air drier, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average by up to 194% in finger heads and up to 254% in repair.</seg>
<seg id="96">Drying hands with a jet air drying machine has led to an increase of 42% on average of the total number of bacteria in finger heads and 15% in repair.</seg>
<seg id="97">After washing hands and drying with paper correctness, the total number of bacteria decreased on average by up to 76% in finger heads and up to 77% in repairs. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether any method of drying resulted in contamination between other toilet users and the toilet environment.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet air dryer, which allegedly extracts air at speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms from hands and unit and potentially pollute other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.</seg>
<seg id="99">The hot air hand drying machine releases microorganism up to 0.25 meters from the machine.</seg>
<seg id="100">No specific prevalence of microorganisms has been observed in the paperwork. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying have been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="101">After drying hands the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:</seg>
<seg id="102">There are many manufacturers of hand drying machine, and the hand drying machine in hand drying has been compared with paperwork perfection.</seg>
<seg id="103">The use of hand-cleaning smooth lentils for hand washing is an alternative during travel in the absence of soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">Hands-on alcohol-containing sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="105">Medical hands washing became mandatory after a Hungarian physician named Egnes Semilois found hands washing effective in preventing disease in the hospital environment (in 1846).</seg>
<seg id="106">There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when forgetting them.</seg>
<seg id="107">One study found that the rate of infections using them decreased.</seg>
<seg id="108">The medical hand washing method is for at least 15 seconds, and enough soap and water or gel should be used to squeeze and all parts of the hands should be washed.</seg>
<seg id="109">The hands should be wrapped with the fingers of both hands inside each other.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is a charity under the finger nails, it should be used to brush them away.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since microbes may remain on their hands in the water, it is important that the hands are well cleaned and dried with a clean perfection.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, the paperwork should be used to block water (and if necessary, the exit door should also be opened with paper).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents hands from being re-polluted in those places.</seg>
<seg id="114">The purpose of washing hands in the health care center is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent them from being transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="115">The New England Medical Journal gives that in many medical environments the level of hand washing is at an incredible level, with many physicians and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before contacting patients, and thus carrying microbes.</seg>
<seg id="116">A study has shown that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow diseases by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating the standard methods of hand washing and hand washing in the health care sectors.</seg>
<seg id="117">The Hands-on Hygiene Guide designed by the organization is also published on its website for public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="118">This related review was conducted by Whitby (Whitby) and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="119">Commercial devices can measure and verify hands-on hygiene, if required to prove compliance with regulations.</seg>
<seg id="120">According to the World Health Organization, hands should be washed in the following "five situations":</seg>
<seg id="121">After contact with blood / body fluids</seg>
<seg id="122">Before performing anti-inflammatory work, and</seg>
<seg id="123">After treatment of the patient. Adding an anti-inflammatory chemical in soap ("medical" or "anti-antimicrobial" soap) gives killing strength to the hand washing substance.</seg>
<seg id="124">This kind of action of killing microbes may be required before performing surgery or at medical centers where the possibility of spreading antibiotic resistant organisms is greater. In order to clean someone's hands in a surgical operation it is necessary that there is a tap that runs and stops without touching the hands, some chloroxidine or washing iodine should also be available, alongside there is a healthy means to dry the hands after washing, a healthy brush for rubbing and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">According to this method, it should be washed with hands for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">Rubbing hands for a long time (10 minutes) is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="128">When pouring water, it should be prevented from pouring water into the hands from the elbow.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the handwashing work is completed, the hands should be dried with a healthy cloth, and surgical clothing should be worn.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of microbes, it is best to wash your hands or use an anti-inflammatory substance of the hands before and after treatment of the patient person.</seg>
<seg id="131">It has been found in hospitals to control staphylococcal disease that the biggest benefit of hand washing has come from the initial 20% washing and a little further additional benefit was achieved when the repetition of hand washing exceeded 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Washing hands with simple soap causes more than triple the transmission of bacterial infectious diseases to food than washing with anti-antimicrobial soap. Washing hands with alcohol on hands for an average of 30 seconds and washing hands with anti-antimicrobial soap showed that hands-washing alcohol-containing substances reduce the pollution of antimicrobials by 26% more than anti-antimicrobial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">But soap and water are more effective than hands-washing alcohol-containing substances to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clusterdium deficiency spores. Hands-washing hygiene in health care centers can be used in ways that give employees an education about hand washing, increase the availability of hands-washing alcohol-containing substances, and provide written and verbal reminders to employees.</seg>
<seg id="134">More research is needed in which ways are most effective in different health care centers.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a low-cost and essential tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing possibilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to the challenge that hand washing becomes a global general habit.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, hand washing tubes near private or public bathrooms in many rural areas of Africa are very rare, while there are cheaper options for building hand washing places.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, low levels of hand washing can be a result of a poorly built habit compared to the lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">The promotion and support of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to a change of people's long-term habits.</seg>
<seg id="140">Monitoring and evaluation is necessary in order to prove effective.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic review of 70 research found that community-based behaviors in increasing the habit of hand washing in LMICs are less effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of a hand washing promotion in schools is a "three-star behavior" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap between other healthy demands.</seg>
<seg id="142">When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can rise from one star to three stars eventually.</seg>
<seg id="143">Creating hand washing spaces can become part of hand washing extension campaigns that are being conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="144">The International Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of changing habits. As a result of the spread of the 2019-20 Corona virus, UNICEF promoted the choice of handwashing emoji.</seg>
<seg id="145">A few studies have taken into account the overall impact of the cost of hand washing related to DALYs prevention in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, in a review it has been suggested that promoting hand washing with soap is much more affordable than other ways of protecting water and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have recently given birth in hospitals or injured soldiers - was first recognized by two leading doctors of hands hygiene in the middle of the 19th century: The Hungarian doctor Agnes Semilvis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale who was English and is "the founder of modern nursing."</seg>
<seg id="148">Many people at the time believed that these infections were caused by bad odors called massacres.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the 1980s, the United States Centers for the control and prevention of diseases caused by food and health care-related infections forced the United States to more actively promote hands-on hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">The disease of swine influenza in 2009 and the Coved-19 plague in 2020 led to increased awareness of the importance of washing hands with soaps in many countries to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, posters called "correct hand washing techniques" have been hung near the gloves in public toilets and office buildings and airports in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="152">The phrase "washing your hands" from one thing means that someone expresses dissatisfaction with taking responsibility for his thing or sharing himself in this crime.</seg>
<seg id="153">The text originates from the gospel message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used sentence in English communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth compulsively washes her hands for the effort to clean up the imaginative stain seen in her body, which represents her sinful conscience about the crimes committed by her and also encourages her husband to do so.</seg>
<seg id="155">It has also been found that people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, are forced to wash their hands more often than at other times, and give greater value to hand washing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other compulsory tasks of "cleaning," such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religions also recommend washing hands for healthy and also symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, namely the use of water to wash hands without soap, is part of the idea of washing hands in many religions such as the Bahai faith, Hinduism, Television and the Natalyst Yadav in Judaism, Lawrence in Christianity, and religions in Islam. Religions especially recommend washing a healthy hand after some practices.</seg>
<seg id="158">After using the toilet, Hinduism, Judaism and Islam command the washing of hands.</seg>
<seg id="159">And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam command the washing of hands before and after each meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The spread of Corona virus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people elsewhere in China and the world and infected more than 80,000 people. This is a disastrous outcome for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to this homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which developed SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may spread through evening surfaces and trigger similar knowledge through a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS but is highly prevalent and affects individuals older than young people and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the rapid number of publications on the growing disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing topic of research.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will cover the basics of disease prevention, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, predictable blood, and disease prevention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate the threatening disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The January 25 Spring Festival of 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable occasion for all Chinese whose demand to stay indoors for the entire holidays and many weeks due to the spread of the new disease has increased.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the most homologous for the corona virus (CoV) that caused the development of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV disease -19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The disease began in Wuhan city of China and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, the virus caused more than 80,000 certified cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients were discharged and more than 3,000 patients died.</seg>
<seg id="11">Who warns that COVID-19 is a "Grade 1 enemy of the people" and is potentially much stronger than terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed), in less than two months more than 200 articles have been published about COVID-19 including its virology epidemiology, ecology, diagnosis, and treatment. Since the first report on 7 January 2020 that the sequence of the virus was scheduled to be isolated from multiple patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in a new and rapidly growing topic area.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some of the remaining urgent questions we have learned so far.</seg>
<seg id="16">CoVs are traditionally known to humans as non-fatal diseases, which typically cause 15% of 4 normal colds.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, in this century, we have twice been exposed to high-running human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which actually caused the spread of disease and death in China first in 2003 and then in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with fear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third widespread incidence of CoV in the recorded history of humans / humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in figure 1, 1, a cluster of pneumonia that had an unknown source was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the China National Health Commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven (7) days after the CoV sequence was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">The first fatal case was reported on January 15, 2020 in Wuhan city.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the meantime, the disease quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that the transition from human to human was possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, Wuhan city was blocked with the entire public transport stop.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed patients, only 21 of them had direct contact with the Wuhan marine food market which was considered to be the starting site of the disease from the source of an unidentified animal.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, WHO announced that this is a global health emergency.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of this report, the disease had already spread in China and had also circulated to 50 other countries around the world. (Figure. (Figure 2) 2).</seg>
<seg id="28">As the situation expands rapidly, the final circle and intensity of the expansion will become more specific.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients including 8,866 patients presented an updated description of the disease as follows (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / ULBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most are within 30-65 years.</seg>
<seg id="31">About half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14% of infected individuals were under 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 has amounted to 0.27 / 100,000 more males than females (0.31 / 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">Covid-19 was originally spread across clusters in and around Hubby.</seg>
<seg id="34">Covid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average duration of pollution was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The initial ratio number (R0) was 3.77 (% 95 CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased unprecedented before January 23, 2020, compared with the largest shipping time before the spring festival in China.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (% 95 CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality of all patients was 3.06 (% 59. 4-02.2: CI 95%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoVs are sub-families of large and covered viruses that contain a sense RNA unit.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four types, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to be infected in humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spike envelope (S) glycoprotein belongs to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively to the angiotensin conversion enzyme of these cell receptors 2 (ACE2) and deptidal peptides 4 (DPP4), and then membrane fusion occurs.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after reacting to the virus genome, the genomic RNA forms virion-containing viscles with envelope glycoproteins and nucleopside proteins, which then detoxify with the plasma membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is reported on 10 January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">SARS-CoV-2 was discovered as a new type of beta CoV that has a genetic identity of more than 99.98% among the 10 sequenced samples collected from the Havana marine market in the expanding main area.</seg>
<seg id="47">SARS-CoV-2 is genetically very similar to SARS-CoV compared to MAR-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">Through the microscopy of transmission ballisters, the SARS - CoV - 2 particles have been found in the ultraviolet parts of the human aerobic epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="49">Human ACE2 was found to be the recipients for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is significantly weaker than SARS-CoV associated with human ACE2, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form a familiar short protein that is spread through orf3b and excluded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral infection capability and adopts the case of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known active domain or form.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhu, ETL, reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in the complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex, which has open and closed conditions, is collected as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture can bind two S proteins, which provide evidence for CoV identification and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for testing medicines to bury SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Source and Intermediate Hosting</seg>
<seg id="57">It has been recognized that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening surroundings and were transmitted to humans through cats and tears respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Through a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the evening show was the main host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs known as -SL-CoVZX45. bat - SL-CoVZX21</seg>
<seg id="59">However, what the intermediate host has helped the virus to overcome the species's barriers to becoming infected with humans, and its path to transmission is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="60">G, ETL, offered Maran as a virus carrier to humans from the evening surroundings which included the homologous group within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that penguins - long-mouthed, mice-eating animals that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 that is based on 99% of the genetic homology found in penguins and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the spread of% 1 difference in the two genomes is still a major difference; thus, looking forward to the results of true and accurate evidence (figure .33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely recognized.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and can stay under 5 days to 20 ° C and% 40-% 50 humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultra violet radiation and temperature at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, chlorine containing, anti-inflammatory, parasitic acid, chloroform and other oil solvents, but chloroxidine cannot effectively inactivate this virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">Not all human populations are generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this infectious virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure. (Figure 4) 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">Typically, after the virus attacks a host, it is first identified by the host's domestic immune system through sample identification recipients (PRRs), including recipients like C-type lexicon, recipients like all types of recipient TLR (NOD), and - (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">In a variety of ways, the virus stimulates the combination of inflammatory factors, endocrine cell completion, and type I interventions (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macropha phagosynthesis of the virus antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help escape the virus from immune responses.</seg>
<seg id="73">Soon, the immune adaptive response combines to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T4 lymphocytes including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells play an important role in the defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8 + T cells directly kill the infected cells of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">T Z cells produce proline flashy cytokines to help immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by stimulating T cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nervous immunity supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also necessary against viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, a healthy patient's antibodies replace MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, overworking the immune system locally creates large radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, cause multi-organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SARS-CoV-2 episode, initiated with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">It is normal that for people who are infected with the virus in large numbers or whose immune functions are compromised, they have a greater chance of being infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 - 14 days, most of which are 3-7 days based on the initial study of 425 cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study on 1,099 cases showed that the duration of contraction was on average 3 days and was 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">A recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is very important for health authorities to regulate the effective timing of the quarantine based on the rule, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but unsymptomatic people to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a common practice, individuals suffering from this disease or becoming infected, usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the quarantine period extend to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is often one of the major and early symptoms of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by without any symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, organ / muscle pain, circulation, headache, throat, scarring, chest pain, diarrhoea, dizziness / vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experienced dyspnea and / or hypoxemia a week after the disease began.</seg>
<seg id="91">In severe cases, patients with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and quagulopathy have progressed rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="92">Patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of uptake was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spina, and 3% for diarrhea. 8% of patients need open air.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the family cluster and cluster caused by a transplant from a non-muscular patient.</seg>
<seg id="95">Relatively, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) were their main symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these require air-conditioning support, more than COVID-19 patients and corresponding to higher MERS fatalities compared to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">In SARS patients, it was indicated that fever (% 99 -% 100), dry cough (% 29 -% 75), dysphoria (% 40 -% 42), diarrhea (% 20-25), and throat pain (% 13) -25) were major symptoms and approximately 14--% 20% of patients had fresh air necessary.</seg>
<seg id="99">On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.</seg>
<seg id="100">Relatively, SARS death in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 certified cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, death was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">An earlier study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was higher than the level of 6.47 with a 5.71-7.23% 95 interval (CI), while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on their symptoms, deaths, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than the last two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Thus, SARS-CoV-2 disease control is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">The start of a cluster often occurs in the same family or similar meeting or vehicle such as a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients often have a history of travel or accommodation in Whitehall or other affected areas or two weeks before contacting infected persons or patients.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and hospital discharged patients can transmit the virus again, which sends a call to increase quarantine time.</seg>
<seg id="109">Patients have a normal or small number of white blood cells (especially lymphatitis) at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells number &lt; 4 × 109 / L has been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte number 1 × 109 / L, and high asperate aminotransferase levels and virimia.</seg>
<seg id="111">Increased levels of liver / cervical and muscle enzymes and myglobin in the blood of liver patients, and the degradation of C- reactive protein and arthrosite increased in the blood of many patients.</seg>
<seg id="112">In patients suffering from severe cases, D-dimer levels, which are a product of fibron degradation in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased</seg>
<seg id="113">Abnormalities in breast radiography have been found in many COVID-19 patients and have been vaguely obscured by the shadow of a bilateral patch in the lungs or the vagueness of the earth's glass.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients often develop neurological pneumonia, severe lung injury, and severe respiratory disorder (ARDS) syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis damage the gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">The disruption of type I and type II patterns reduces surfactant levels and increases surface pressure, thus reducing lung ability and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Therefore, radiographic findings of bad breasts often parallel the extreme extent of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 was in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, according to the pathology. The virus infection was similar to ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcripts polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, due to high error-negative levels, which may accelerate the disease, clinical manifestations used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar condition also occurred with the diagnosis of saris.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group described the protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in 20 × 10-18 mol / l to 200. -18 10-18 mol / l (10-100 copies of each microlayer of the internet) use deepstack in less than an hour without requiring an explanatory tool.</seg>
<seg id="124">Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically improve sensitivity and convenience if certified in clinical samples.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience with unfamiliar CoV, therapists can provide supporting care to COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of treatments that have already been used or recommended for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These treatments include current and potential treatments for antiviral drugs, ammonosperms, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support from received patients.</seg>
<seg id="127">Even plasma from the received patients was recommended to be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies promote antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack, to a lesser degree, other members that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">However, respiratory disease and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Thus, respiratory support is important for reducing symptoms and saving lives and this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, defective ventilation, and the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be helped with extrapotent membrane oxygen (ECMO), a heart fixing technique used to treat life-threatening heart and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, electronic balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It has been recognized that cytokine storms result from excessive function of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="135">The cytokine storm is part of a systematic inflammatory response released by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines encourage immune cells to release many free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and membrane failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunity is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.</seg>
<seg id="138">Cortez Costeroids and Tosilazumab, an antibody of IL6, have been used to treat cytokine hurricanes.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immune treatments for cytokine storm include guided immune response modification by T cell; IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppression 4 and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids, as an immune force, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, steroids at higher doses were not useful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting progenitors.</seg>
<seg id="143">However, short courses of corticosteroids ranging from low to medium size are recommended to use COVID-19 carefully for serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="144">Until the time of writing, no antiviral effects have been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, the administration of vessels with Remedeswear, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remidswire is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilad initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlborough viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, the recall also showed a possible inhibitor of other single infected RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on this, Guild has provided the center to China to conduct these pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, baricatinib, antiretron α, lupinavir / retonavir and rubavir have been recommended as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhoea, inflammation, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combined treatment with lupinavir / retonavir.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interactions of these treatments with other medicines used for patients should be carefully investigated.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma acquired patients and antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="153">Collecting blood from patients arising from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from disease prevention has a long history.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, healthy patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immune force formed by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other foreign objects and to identify specific molecules in such diseases and directly influence them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who healed from COVID-19 and injected into 10 serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammation and viral pressures and the growth of oxygen saturation in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, confirmation and details are required before specific treatments have yet to be developed to suggest a method for large-scale use.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the damage associated with plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can promote immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.</seg>
<seg id="161">The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large enough to treat serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight against global disease is very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Thus, it is very serious and practical to separate B cells from patient cells and identify effective antibodies or examinations or genetic codes against the necessary proteins of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">Thus, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">TCM has been used to treat a range of diseases in China for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its effects rely largely on the combination of many parts in the formula that depend on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM feedback.</seg>
<seg id="167">Many effective components remain unknown or vague because it is difficult to extract and verify the same ingredients or their best recipes.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have returned from severe stages.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shin Feng Xi Du Capsule and Lian Ho King Wen Capsule were found effective for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">The best treatment rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been considered in several provinces of China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Nangya (50%), and Hanan (50%), while Hubi province, which used TCM in only 30% of these COVID-19 patients had the lowest treatment rate (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is somewhat relatively comparable because many other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues released a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with WM and TCM combined therapy.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the recovery of body temperature, disappearance of symptoms, and hospitalization required times were much shorter than just the WM group in the WM + TCM group.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most effectively, the symptomatic worst rate (from light to serious) for the WM + TCM group was significantly lower for the WM + TCM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was only lower in the WM + TCM group versus the WM + TCM group (8.8% versus 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">With this, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaiting well-controlled trials at large scales and other centers.</seg>
<seg id="176">It will be noteworthy to determine the mechanism of action and to determine the effective components of TCM treatment or their combinations if possible.</seg>
<seg id="177">Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience great fears of highly infectious and even fatal diseases, and quarantined people also experience fatigue, loneliness, narrowness and anger.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of disease such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and adverse treatment effects such as insomnia caused by carticoasters can cause excessive anxiety and psychological suffering.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the first phase of SARS disease, a range of psychiatric disorders including persistent depression, anxiety, fear attacks, psychiatric excitement, psychiatric symptoms, reluctance, and even suicide were reported.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mandatory communication tracking and quarantine, as part of public health reactions to COVID-19 disease, can lead people to greater concern and guilt about the infectious disease, quarantine, and notorious effects on family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thus, psychological health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspicious individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are required.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multifaceted psychological health teams, clear communication with regular and minute updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are necessary to interfere with the range of transmission from animal deposits and infected humans to infected nucleus and are often antiviral therapeutic supplements in controlling the disease caused by viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">Efforts have been launched to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and strong neutral antibodies and / or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Live feeding vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and fatal challenge models and their protection against zonotic virus abnormalities were still specified before clinical studies began.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is probably because SARS was dismantled 17 years ago and no new cases have been raised since then.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, cases and clusters of MERS type occur in the Middle East and also spread to other areas where zonotic sources continue to grow in abnormal areas.</seg>
<seg id="189">The vaccination strategy was developed for Mers using passive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vitracles, nanoparticles, viruses-like particles and reproductive protein subunits and some of them were evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and serious task to control the ongoing plague.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, it is challenging to overcome the problems because a longer period of time (on average 18 months) is required for vaccine development and dynamic changes of CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an unfamiliar disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its full clinical course across a thousand patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually recover without slicing.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high disease and mortality in patients with serious illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or influenced by the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">Covid-19 is commonly developed in 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients aged 8,866 above 50 in the study.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who needed intensive care had the most likely disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those who were not aged 66 - 51 at the middle age of years, whose age suggests COVID-19 patients as a prognostic factor for outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: SARS - CoV - 2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 compared to 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.</seg>
<seg id="201">Disorders and disorders: Covid-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to have severe heart disease and arthritis disease.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiovascular events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be binding to ACE2-positive cholangosite, which may cause certain / liver loss in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are strongly linked and may interfere with each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Abnormal laboratory findings: Levels of C- reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injuries and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and ultimate recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">The CRV level connection with the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19 has also been recommended.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated lactate de hydrogenase (LDH), asperate aminotransferases (AST), Alanine aminotransferases (ALT), and cretine kinase (CK) may also help predict results.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and nose / liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">Thus, these are traditional indicators for deactivating the heart or retina / liver.</seg>
<seg id="210">Major Clinical Signs: Breast radiography and temporary development of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict and complicate the outcome of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroids Use: As described above, steroids are immune diseases that are used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">Since high amounts of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have been exposed to isocular osteconosis with disability and poor quality of life throughout their lives.</seg>
<seg id="213">Thus, if needed, steroids should be used in low dose and in COVID-19 patients for a short period of time.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients during COVID-19 disease have suffered from abnormal stress as they often tolerate imprisonment and chronic uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and friends.</seg>
<seg id="215">It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients return to a healthy and normal life from stress.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replicating in low respiration, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively trigger a reaction in the upper respiratory tract and cause moderation or symptoms during the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause normal colds.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, infected patients at the first stage or during the incubation period can develop large quantities of the virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty to control the disease.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not occur in the first phase.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is much more rigid and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">There are currently major efforts underway in China including the continuous quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and almost all the population including the SARS-CoV-2 transport route.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these practices are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the burden of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end in March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">But still, other experts aren't so optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter, ET All, has estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than SARS, will not be finished in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Langini, and others, developed an example to predict the outcome of the disease and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in both medium turbinity and throat tracts of patients who had healed 2 weeks ago and left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical phenomenon like influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, promising signs have occurred based on the decreasing number of new cases in China, which indicates the current strategies may work.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola was originally predicted to lead to a million cases with half a million deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through severe quarantine and isolation, the disease is ultimately controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">It is possible, unlike SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weakened in infection and ultimately die or remain a less pathogenic virus partner with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Comparison of COVID-19 disease with SVS and Mers is provided below (figure .55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through cough or sneezing / cooling, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated substances by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus was also found in the human immune system, which raises a new probability of mouth-through-mouth transmission.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were potentially caused by non-infectious diseases, including 17 other patients involved with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="236">Thus, it should be careful to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even in contact with patients or infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="238">A surgical face mask prevents the liquid drop of a potentially diseased member from traveling through the air or entering the surfaces of the material, where it can be transferred to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only the N95 (Series # 1860s) mask can protect against inhalation of small viruses from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viruses are capable of entering completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both of them are around 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since the particles can penetrate even five surgical masks together, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, health care providers should wear fat isolated clothing to further reduce contact with viruses.</seg>
<seg id="242">Viruses can also make someone sick through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have been inserted into his body through his inflammatory eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Thus, health care providers should also wear a transparent face cover or goggles while working with patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay inside the house to protect themselves and limit contact with potential patients.</seg>
<seg id="246">Step three / step staying away from the patient is called the perfect distance for people.</seg>
<seg id="247">These actions are effective methods that reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 has come to the human world as a new virus, its excellent homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have been the cause of high alert to China due to its deep memory about the spread of SARS in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, not until January 2020 the director of disease control in Wuhan is satisfying citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low infectious and limited proportion of people from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.</seg>
<seg id="250">This message reduced the enthusiasm of the people comfortably, especially when the whole country is preparing for the spring festival, and lost important time to prevent this disease in Wuhan at least.</seg>
<seg id="251">Disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements because every word is valuable to the public and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to initially having a potential disease rather than relieving the public. And (4) more often targeted and effective drills to raise awareness of infectious diseases and intermittently examine and</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 disease was caused by the infectious virus SARS-CoV-2 which began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">In less than two months, at the time of its writing, the disease spread in China and around 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a sense of repetition of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are mandatory for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">Covid-19 affects individuals older than young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in older individuals than in young people.</seg>
<seg id="258">SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (1.44% compared to 10.91%.)</seg>
<seg id="259">COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which causes a much greater difficulty in the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">Regular RNA Assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, medicated patients can then be positive for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Given the rapid progress made in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues are still being addressed, including the following:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% of genetic homologues were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two shopperk SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal was an average animal that transmitted the virus from the original host to the human?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers of the numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce transmission, and these events can be rearranged at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular modeling and biochemical writing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 is related, how exactly does the virus enter air cells and then make pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Is the virus also associated with ACE2 expressing cells in other members?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will this disease continue?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does this virus genetically develop during transmission between humans?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it be pulled out all over the world, die like SARS or rise like colds at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="275">This is mandatory but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, with whatever cost it can demand, we have no choice but to stop the plague as quickly as possible and bring our lives back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019.</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no clinical trials have been completed on any vaccine, many efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="3">In February 2020, the World Health Organization said that the organization does not expect the formation of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a related or causative virus, in less than 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were five candidates for the vaccine in the Phase I safety studies in April.</seg>
<seg id="5">Quoid-19 was introduced in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">Worldwide the disease spread to a high level in 2020, resulting in significant investment and research activity in the development of a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations use the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="8">As revealed in April, the necessary measures of CEPI's initiative to build a vaccine include acceleration, manufacturing capacity, providing a certain amount of information, and universal access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, scientists reported that in early 2020 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="10">The major objectives of the platform where progress was made in Phase I safety research include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (first phase developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, MRNA -1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral Victor (first phase developer and vaccine candidate: Casino Biologics, adenovirus species 5 Victor)</seg>
<seg id="13">As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 others have been announced but with less public information available (it is considered to be under plan or in design).</seg>
<seg id="14">The Phase I-II test, which is conducted in the initial safety and immunogenesity test, is a generally random, placebo controller, and is conducted in various sites / locations, while also a more accurate and effective doses / medication determinant.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are generally many participants in the Phase III tests. These participants include a control group, the effectiveness of vaccine tests for disease prevention, while monitoring side effects in hopeful doses / medications.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates confirmed in the active development phase since early April 2020, 74 of them have not been tested in human evaluation (Latvia are in the pre-clinical research stages).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around 24 April 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that the university is undergoing research into a possible molecular receptor vaccine that genetically triggers a change in viral proteins to trigger an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan or video-interval announced the beginning of work on a vaccine, aimed at starting human tests in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">The vaccine development project was announced on 26 January 2020 at the China Disease Control and Prevention Center, and on 28 January at the University of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Haneke Scotimaker, announced that these companies have started work on developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen, with the help of her biotechnology partner, vaccinated vaccines through the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 18 March 2020, Emergency Biosolution announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaccart to develop a vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="27">On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St.Louis announced a project to build a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="28">On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Technical Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring both announced in Western Maryland that they were working on a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="29">Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were partnering with Novavax Inc.</seg>
<seg id="30">The vaccine has been integrated into the development and production.</seg>
<seg id="31">Both partners announced plans for pre-clinical trials and Phase I of clinical trials in July 2020.</seg>
<seg id="32">On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working separately on 11 macrobial symptoms, and that, too soon, the creation of a vaccine would take around one to two years.</seg>
<seg id="33">On 12 March 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City reported the manufacture and development of coronavirus particles supported in part by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.</seg>
<seg id="34">The selective vaccine is a laboratory study alongside human tests planned in July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier this week, the Guardian newspaper reported that US President Donald Trump had paid more for wider access to the Kovac-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.</seg>
<seg id="36">On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German biotech company to develop an MRNA-based vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">The MRNA-based selective vaccine BNT162, which is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials, is due to begin clinical trials in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian company, announced that they will receive the test results before the clinic in April 2020 and the latest selective vaccine will start human tests in the autumn / treasure.</seg>
<seg id="39">On 19 March 2020 the Coalition of Fifties of Plague Preparedness in France announced a $4.9 million investment for the Coved-19 Vaccine Research Association. The association includes the Institute Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Petersburg, bringing the total CEPI's investment to $29 million in vaccine development.</seg>
<seg id="40">Other CEPI investment partners for the manufacture of the Coved-19 vaccine are Moderna, Kurovak, Inovo, Novavakis, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different selective vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers from Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine for Quoid-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The selective vaccine was developed from China within 14 days with the receipt of the series.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Canadian government announced financial support of 275 million Canadian dollars in 96 research projects involving a number of selective vaccines in Canadian companies and universities like Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan Initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="45">At the same time, the Canadian government announced a specific $192 million Canadian donation to the development of the Coved-19 vaccine. It also includes plans to establish a "vaccine bank" of various new vaccines that will be used to spread / create another form of corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="46">On 2 April 2020, researchers at the medical school of the University of Petersburg reported on Petkovac tests. This is a possible vaccine of kovac-19 in mice. The report stated that, "MNA presented second level vaccines of saris-kovac-2 ES1 that stimulated potent antibodies specific to the antigen [in mice] that appeared within 2 weeks after immunity."</seg>
<seg id="47">In Canada on 16 April 2020, the Waterloo University School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA selective vaccine as a possible nose spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Using bacteriophagesis, DNA will be designed to place bacteria inside the human body in order to produce harmless particles / particles like the virus that can encourage the immune system to produce antibodies against the Saris-Koo-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the United States government, industry, and three universities, including cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, combined and shared their resources to acquire supercomputers from EBM.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects / adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that they can also have other benefits alongside preventing disease.</seg>
<seg id="52">For random checks / tests of Lanoro in Australia want to hire 4170 health workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is possible that the vaccine is not safe and effective while in development.</seg>
<seg id="54">Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models related to Coved-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals, and non-human nipple animals requires international coordination to ensure 3rd level biological safety measures and standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in non-human or animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">Until 2020, so far no such vaccine has been developed for the therapeutic or safety of SARS to prove that it is also safe and effective for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the introduction and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against SARS.</seg>
<seg id="58">When MERS was published, it was believed that the available SARS research might provide a useful model for developing vaccines and medicines against MERS-Koo disease.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, there was only one vaccine based on DNA that has completed Phase I of clinical trials in humans and three others are in development. All vaccines are virus transmitter vaccines, the other two are adenoviral-vectoroid or ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is the MVA-MERS-S vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="60">Social media posts have expanded the theory of disturbance that it is claimed that the Coved-19 virus was not known before and that the vaccine had not been available before.</seg>
<seg id="61">The recorded inventions, which were documented by many social media posts, referenced other types of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, genetic ranges and vaccines available.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is connected to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin II and inhibits the activity of angiotensin-conversion enzyme (ACE) with increased Ang (1-7), and thus becomes a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for some coronavirus into cells.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">The angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, containing a metallic enzyme and based on the surface of the angiotensil and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and the C-terminal clinical renal amino acid transmitter domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single aggressive I type membrane protein, which has an enzymatically active domain, and appears on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The outer domain of ACE2 is separated from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme known as schidas, and the last soluble protein spreads into the bloodstream and eventually exits through urine or urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is available in multiple organs: ACE2 is connected in multiple organs to the main lung II type allular cells, small intestinal anthrocytes, artery and vascular endothelial cells and artery flat muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">The form of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stream, hypothalamus, and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The primary task of ACE2 is to act as a balancer for ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE separates viagonistractor angiotensin II into angiotensin II hormone.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenyllin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and turns it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides, such as [des-Arg9] - bridecanine, opylene, neurotensin, Denorphine A, and Grelin.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates the membrane containing the inhibitory amino acid transmitter SLC6A19 and is infected with Hartnapp.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a trans-membrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main place to enter cells for certain coronavirus, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); OSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">Specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein with the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface causes endocrinosis and transmission for both viruses and enzymes that are based in the cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">This process of entry also requires the preparation of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential therapist. That has led to some assumptions that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight the disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing the standard ACE skills and treatment of ARB.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE controllers was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced in patients who were treated with ACE skills who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those who had brain stroke and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE controllers was also associated with reducing pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were "slightly stronger than the overall risk of pneumonia."</seg>
<seg id="22">The human synthesis of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered as a new treatment for acute pulmonary injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen influences in pigs with the aroused severe respiratory syndrome of lipopolysaccharide.</seg>
<seg id="23">Half the age of rhACE2 in humans is around 10 hours and the start of action for 24 hours in addition to the effect (duration) is 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a hopeful drug for those who do not have the tolerance of classic rhino - angiotensin system masters (RAS masters) or in those diseases where angiotensin II has been elevated. The injection of rhACE2 to treat acute respiratory syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-20 Coronavirus plague continues with the plague of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a severe respiratory disease caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The recognition of the plague was made in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and on December thirty-three, the lower helmet emergency was plagued in the country due to international concerns, and on March 11, 2020, the date of the plague was again reversed.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a measure on 10th April 2020, 1.60 million cases of Crona Verse were reported in 210 countries, causing the deaths of more than 97,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Almost 364,000 people have been recovered from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="5">The death rate was recorded in China at 4%, and worldwide again at 13.04% in Algeria at .08% and in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="6">General practices include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="7">The serious and complicated symptoms of the disease include pneumonia, various knowledge of respiratory system impairment, and activity of many members of the body, resulting in weakness or death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The symptoms typically appear within five days, but in some cases it takes two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the new corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first treatment symptoms are beneficial to the patient and his assistance, prescribed precautionary measures are important, such as washing hands, catching something to the mouth while coughing, keeping distance with each other, and separating suspects from themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Internationally, authorities are implementing laws such as travel bans, quarantine, curfew, risk control at work locally.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of the plague, severe pay and economic disruption in the world, there has been a widespread decline in games, religious, political and cultural events and fears of taking place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Universities and Maccabona are closed on a national or local basis in all 193 countries of the world, which affected around 99.4 percent of students worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Online virus references were shared with gold misinformation, and against the Chinese people have come forward with incidents of homophobia and discrimination, including people of eastern and South East Asian generations, and areas where the virus occurs.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions due to the reduction of portable equipment and the ban on large mills.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 31 December 2019, an unknown ecology incident was reported in Wuhan, China's Hubi province.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many occurrences have links to the marine food of Havana and it is said that the origin of the virus is zonetic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The plague broadcaster virus known as SARS-CoV, the newly found virus is closely resembling Corona virus, Pangolin coronovirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person who suffered on 1December 2019 did not have any connections to this vet cluster market</seg>
<seg id="19">In the first reported incidents in December 2019, two-thirds of people were found to have connections to the market.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an unconfirmed report in the South China Merning Post newspaper on 13March 2020 in China, the 55-year-old Hiba Sabah was found to have an incident on 17November 2019, on 26 February 2020 WHO reported a decrease in WHO incidents in China but Rostow increased incidents in Italy, Iran and South Korea. For the first time, China has not increased incidents outside.</seg>
<seg id="21">Reporting cases may be very rare, especially in cases with minor knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="22">In February 26 fewer cases were reported in young people, including young people under the age of 19 and 2.4% in the world, Patrick Volance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of England should have immunity before the disease.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of incidents refers to people who have been tested for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of 23 March, a country also did not test 3% of its population, there were policies in many countries that would not test these low-term symptoms, such as Atali, Netherlands, White and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a study published on 16 March, it was said that up to 23 January, 86% of cases of COVID-19 disease had not been found and that this non-certified infection was the source for 79 cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to data released on March 30th, the number of people infected with corona disease in Italy is much higher than it was reported about.</seg>
<seg id="27">The underlying production number before the initial size of COVID-19 is RO (1.40) not up to 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to a study published by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most people heal from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="30">It does not recover until death, the practice is 6 to 41 days, and for the most common people it is 14days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97.000 billion deaths have been caused by Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">In China, 80% of deaths until February 5 were in individuals over the age of 60, and 75% of individuals had already had heart and diabetes, generally "officially giving COVID-19 individuals a protocol for testing positive.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is possible that the number of people who died due to COVID-19 is really increasing, because it would include people who died without testing, for example in homes or nursing homes and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="34">Preliminary data from Italy shows that the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is 5x-4 greater than the official deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that (the number of people who died) was shown to be lower, this anecdotal report was confirmed to be lower accountability in an ISS, such as the H1N1 swine flue in 2009. The first confirmed death was on January 9, 2020 in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first bodies outside the Chinese mainland were found in the Philippines on February 1, and the first bodies outside Asia were found in France on February 14.</seg>
<seg id="37">28 February Out of China's central land, dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">On March 13th, more than 40 countries and territories and deaths were reported in every continent outside Antarctica, with more general measures taken to measure the deaths.</seg>
<seg id="39">These numbers change over area and time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of health care, treatment option, time after the initial incident and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health, the ratio of death to incident reflects the number of deaths divided with the number of incidents diagnosed during a given time.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the proportion of deaths in the world as of April 10th, 2020 is 6.0%.</seg>
<seg id="41">This number varies by area level.</seg>
<seg id="42">The proportion of deaths in China decreased by 17.3% in individuals (in which it is 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in which there were symptoms after 1 February, 2020). Other steps include the incident death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals who died from the disease, and the incident rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals who died from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics do not have a time limit and the individuals must follow the solution from infection to infection.</seg>
<seg id="44">Some scientific institutions have tried to use these data for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Oxford University Center has spent a measure based on evidence that the disease rate is between 0.1% to 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The highest amounts of this range in Germany are constant COVID-19 diagnoses, and a statistical study gives the diagnosis a measure of becoming effective in CFR.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization has indicated that the plague can be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="48">The increase and timing of the disease is chaotic and that the location is different on occasion.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni of Penn Department University says that the general type of unchecked infection disease begins to decrease and then decrease when the disease passes through the available host.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, it is not possible to predict something wise now that it will ever happen.</seg>
<seg id="51">Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nashan argues that this will be terminated until June, if all countries act on the advice given by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On 17March, is Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene &amp; Typical Medicine saying that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially spread for up to one or two years.</seg>
<seg id="53">Neil Ferguson, in the Imperial College study, said that it would be distance and other precautions to each other "unless vaccines were available (in the course of 18 months or more)."</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is not possible that this corona virus - because it is easy to install - will disappear completely and it is possible" to turn into a seasonal disease, which can come back every year.</seg>
<seg id="55">The recovery of the virus will depend on the extent of immunity and change.</seg>
<seg id="56">The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively "non-specific" and sick individuals can be without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are 88% fever and 68% doubtful heat.</seg>
<seg id="58">Small numbers of general practices include fatigue, phlegm, lack of cognitive sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joints, throat pain, headache, cancer, vomiting, hemotherapy, patches or sciences. The World Health Organization says that one in six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in America has developed a list of emergency symptoms, including respiratory problems, pain or stress in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulties in waking up and getting stuck in the face or lips. These symptoms have been prescribed immediate medical attention. The disease can further increase severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, sabbatics and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">There will be no symptoms or medical symptoms in these individuals, but the disease will appear in the diagnosis, the researcher advised that those who were closely associated with the infection should be kept in mind and researched to end the infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China has spent 44% of the amount of symptoms without disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">There is a time of 14days between cognition and pollution, there were more than 5 days, in this case unrealistic whereas COVID-19 facial individuals are 30 percent of the inflammatory sensation and roast again become 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some descriptions of how the disease spreads are still at the specific stage.</seg>
<seg id="64">The first disease is living in close contact with individuals, due to heat, drops in the air, opens or spreads through 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 ft) talking to individuals nearby.</seg>
<seg id="65">The findings show that due to coughing in the open air, the virus can be transmitted from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 (27) feet.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some people suggest that the virus can also be transmitted in the form of small droplets in the air because it remains in the air for many hours, which does not leave the mouth during talking, respiratory droplets also occur during the breath, but when talking, the analgesic virus does not become powerful in the air.</seg>
<seg id="67">These droplets can be laid in the mouth of nearby individuals or in the nose or possibly go into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some medical practices such as antibacterial and cardiopulmonary recycling (CPR) are also respiratory moisture aerosolysis and these can spread into the air.</seg>
<seg id="69">The virus may also spread through touching the eyes, nose and mouth in case of contact with contaminated surfaces including skin.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is also concern that the disease also spreads to waste fertilizers, but this risk is considered low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has denied the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has been spread from contamination. The virus is spreading more than three days after the symptoms arrive, even though there is a possibility of spreading before the symptoms appear and the last phase of suffering.</seg>
<seg id="72">People have tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of the concussion that there is a possibility of transmission before significant symptoms arise.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are only reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact finding investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads easily, one person typically infects two to three others. The virus lives during hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">In particular, the virus was found to be detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on a board card for one day, and in copper for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">It varies, however, based on moisture and temperature. Pet animals and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, such as with other surfaces that could have been in contact with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe and fragile respiratory syndrome Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new virus that was first taken from three patients with severe respiratory disease related to pneumonia in Wahan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All components of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in the related corona virus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the family soap, which analyzes its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is said that the origin of the virus is from animals.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis suggests that the corona virus genetically clusters together two double stem strains in the subgenus sarbaceous virus (genetic b) with the beta corona virus genre.</seg>
<seg id="82">It is similar to other smoky corona virus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at 96% of the total genome level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans in certain parts of the genome sequences.</seg>
<seg id="84">Compared to the full genome with the date, relatively 92% of the material found genetic material shared between the pangolin corona virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficient to prove pangolin to be an intermediate host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection by virus can be briefly diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by the replacement of infected products or CT imaging.</seg>
<seg id="86">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wahan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, most of its reactions are covered with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology suggests that "CT should not be used for first line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19."</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, initially released on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Tests can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are usually available from a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">In general this test is done on a nasopharyngel swab while a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">The serological test developed by Celix in the United States has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="95">Imaging features in radiographs and computational tomography (CT) that are symptomatic include irrelevant peripheral grid opiosis and absent optimism factor</seg>
<seg id="96">The Association of Italian Radiologists is setting up an international online database of photographic findings for confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to overuse with other infections such as adeno virus, photography without approval by PCR has limited characteristics in identifying COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A major study in China compared the results of CT with PCR and stated that although the reaction is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its attention as a screening tool in epidemic fields.</seg>
<seg id="99">Strong nerve networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed with both radiographs and CT to detect viral imagery.</seg>
<seg id="100">Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, inhibiting the abandonment of hands with hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sticking and putting tissue directly into a waste container.</seg>
<seg id="101">Those who may already have an infection are similarly recommended to wear surgical masks in a common condition.</seg>
<seg id="102">Physical distance measures have also been proposed to prevent transfers. Many states restricted or advised all non-mandatory travel to countries and territories affected by development</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has reached the spread stage in large parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus spreads across communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they are infected. Health care providers take care of those who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact fixing is an important method for health officials to determine the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">For this purpose privacy concerns have been raised by governments using location data from mobile phones, Amnesty International Organization and 100 other organizations have requested such oversight restrictions in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile apps have been implemented or offered for voluntary use, and from April 2020 to April 2020 expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to get closer to the user with other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">The user then receives the message if they have a close relationship with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings are spread about how to prevent the disease. For example, nose cleaning and mouth wash are not effective.</seg>
<seg id="108">The Covid-19 vaccine is not available, although many organizations are working to make this vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hand washing can prevent the spread of the disease or reduce its spread.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC recommends that people wash for at least twenty seconds often with soap and water, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after hitting the mat, cough or cough.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by family soap, which breaks its protective bubble.</seg>
<seg id="112">The CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based handheld sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization tells people not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth until you wash your hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">Faces can be anti-virus-infected with the help of a number of solutions (expose the corrosive polypropylene face to the virus cleaner for at least a minute) which includes 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% ice propylene, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen on oxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate can be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC indicates that any office or any other location is a suspicious or cooked incident of corona so that all rooms, bathrooms, shared sitting areas, shared electrical machines such as tablets, touch sugars, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines which are used by the runner can all be cleared of virus.</seg>
<seg id="117">Health organizations use their voices to collect their mouth and nose from the elbow or strip them with fabrics and then handle these fabrics immediately.</seg>
<seg id="118">Surgical training may be recommended for individuals who are suffering from the virus, but training can reduce the ability to cough, dizziness or exclude their irreversible respiratory drops while talking.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization recommends when and how to use masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">Before Stephen Griffin, a viral scholar at the University of Leeds, putting a mask on people's faces can be scarce, but not properly cleaning their hands is the reason for Griffin's neck. Masks can also be recommended for individuals who protect and care for sick individuals.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization advises healthy individuals to wear masks in cases where the risk is too great, such as individuals who are not affected by COVID-19, and they also acknowledge that by wearing masks they can protect them from touching their faces.</seg>
<seg id="122">Many countries have begun to encourage people to use masks in public places.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the United States, the CDC has advised putting non-medical barley on the face made of fabric. China has advised putting non-medical barley on privately healthy individuals and then putting non-medical barley on them when they are closer to others (1 m (3 ft) or less).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong General Transport has advised to undergo surgery in case of travel or staying in crowded areas.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thailand's health officials encourage the general public to make face traps from the fabric in their homes and then wash them every day.</seg>

<seg id="127">On 16 March Vietnam has appealed to every citizen to leave abroad when they need face training to protect themselves alongside other persons.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government has forced everyone to enter a shopping centre so face meltdown must be done.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel has called on all citizens to use facial training outside places.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, which has been making ten million trains per day since the average of March, forced the use of trains on 1 April on buses between Hormozgan and the cities.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama has assumed that the use of facial training will be necessary when leaving outside, and has advised those who cannot afford the training to prepare themselves for training in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="132">Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are used in large scale facial barley.</seg>
<seg id="133">Maintaining distance from each other (also known as maintaining bodily distance) includes an operation to mitigate the spread of the disease by reducing the proximity between the individuals.</seg>
<seg id="134">Methods include self-imposing, imposing limits on travel and closing schools, workplaces, playgrounds, exhibitions and markets.</seg>
<seg id="135">Individuals should stay in homes, reduce travel, do not go to the world, do not meet each other at a time of greeting, and stay away from other individuals.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many governments are forced to stay away from each other in those areas or advise those who are affected by the disease.</seg>
<seg id="137">A large number of people from the U.S. government and health organizations immediately brought in 250 people (if there is no COVID-19 spread in this area) from 50 people and then 10 people.</seg>
<seg id="138">On 22 March, Germany banned the meeting of more than two people, increased the risk of severe diseases for older adults and those who are undergoing treatments such as diabetes, heart disease, breath disease, hypertension, and poor immune system, as the CDC advised to live at home. Last March 2020, WHO and other health agencies changed the term "social literacy" to "physical literacy," with the purpose of reducing gold physical contact by maintaining the rubber, if it were punishable</seg>
<seg id="139">The term "social distance" has been guaranteed to ensure that people are fully engaged in social isolation, rather than encouraging others to interact with each other in ways that some officials have also given guidance for sexual health during religious periods.</seg>
<seg id="140">These specific recommendations include that the person who has sex with whom you live, who is not a virus, and who has no virus symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="141">Specific isolation has been recommended at home for those who have been found to have this covid 19 disease and those who are suspected to have the disease as well.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies provide detailed guidance for appropriate specific isolation. Most governments have recommended self-quarantining in the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="143">The strict guidance of self-quarantining terrorists has become more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="144">People who have met those affected by this code 19 and who have travelled to a country or region in the nearest days where the virus has increased, have been prescribed to be quarantined for 14 days from that day.</seg>
<seg id="145">Winding down or prevention and quantitative effects on the surface of spread are included in the policy of controlling the spread.</seg>
<seg id="146">Limiting the virus takes place during the initial steps of Shiva to diagnose and separate people from others in the virus. Another goal is to determine the level of coronary control and vaccine-related components in order to prevent other people from separating.</seg>
<seg id="147">When it becomes impossible to limit mortality, efforts are being made to reduce mortality: Measures are being taken to reduce mortality rates and limit the effects of mortality on society and the health system.</seg>
<seg id="148">It is also possible that both phases of restricting and reducing coronary arteries take place together.</seg>
<seg id="149">Winding down the disease requires more serious measures to reduce the plague, which is less than 1% of the basic number of propagation. One of the precursors of an infectious disease is to try to reduce the graphic tip of the disease which is called the graphic tip of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">This reduces the risk level to health services that have been eliminated and provides overtime to other therapeutic services and vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-invasive cases that can control the virus shut are individual protective measures such as: Hand washing, wearing a mask, and self-quarantining; and social measures that include social protection such as: Closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; and accepting these restrictions by the community and encouraging people to participate in these measures; as well as enduring measures such as cleaning surfaces. When the severity of the virus shut became apparent, China took the most serious measures to limit the virus</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries have also taken various measures to restrict the spread of this virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea questioned all its people and implemented previous quarantines and gave serious warnings to infected people with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provided financial assistance to those who had quarantined themselves and fined those who did not quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan increased the production rate of masks and penalized healthcare providers. The similarities between the UK and America show that there are significant challenges in terms of virus reduction (not reducing the surface of the spread) and virus winding (preventing the rise of plague).</seg>
<seg id="156">The virus reduction policy may reduce the demand for health care by 2 / 3 and death by half, but still hundreds of thousands of people may lose their lives and health care is destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="157">Winding down the virus may be best but should continue until the virus is present among the population (and if the vaccine is made before it should continue until the same period), but if the measures are stopped, it will soon return to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term restrictions to winding down the virus cause social and economic harm.</seg>
<seg id="159">There are no specific anti-virus drugs for Covideo 19, but development efforts are still ongoing, including testing existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">The use of fever medications, drinking fluids, and relaxing may help reduce the symptoms of coronary artery.</seg>
<seg id="161">According to the severity of the epilepsy, the use of artificial oxygen, serum, and strength of the respiratory system are essential for the health of the epilepsy.</seg>
<seg id="162">Steroid use can deteriorate as a result.</seg>
<seg id="163">Many compounds that were for other viral diseases have also been searched for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization said that some "traditional and family treatments" can be relieved in the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The World Health Organization has described increasing capacity and health care measures for COVID-19 patients.</seg>

<seg id="4">Analysis of these closing points presents an appropriate project of developing effective anti-virus drugs against covid-19 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include popcorn-type proteins, RNA-related RNA polymers, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribo phosphates.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hussain A and his friends studied a number of selective compounds, which then conducted their optimization and analysis to find the similarity of skeleton with the most accepted medicines, to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in preclinical studies and to propose them to a clinical research design.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chloroquine is a type of anti-malaria drug that is also used against some automatic immune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and related hydroxy chloroquine will be one of the four medicines to be studied as part of solidarity clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="9">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's testing of chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine will begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxy chloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="10">The treatment of these medicines is not approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is approved by the EUA only as an emergency use experimental treatment on patients who have been hospitalized but are not eligible for treatment in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxy chlorocine to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been determined.</seg>

<seg id="1">Risk control measures of coved-19 in the workplace</seg>
<seg id="2">The risk control measures of Quoid-19 in the workplace include using working safety and health methods to prevent corona virus disease 2019 (Quoid-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">Significant risk control measures in the workplace, risk assessments on the sources of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each employee based on the possibility of infection on Coved-19, depend on the work place and job</seg>
<seg id="4">From the perspective of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there is a low working relationship with people and other employees in low-risk jobs of infection, which is recommended to take early disease prevention measures to prevent infection. Early prevention measures include hand washing, telling employees to stay at home in case of infection, taking measures to prevent infection transmission through breathing, and cleaning and disinfecting the working environment on a daily</seg>
<seg id="5">The average risk of becoming infected with the disease is that it is required to maintain continuous and close relationships with the unknown and people who are suspected of Coveid-19 disease, but may become sick due to ongoing social transmission and international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This working environment includes employees who are in touch with people, such as schools, many people's crowded working environments, and people's crowded retail sales spaces.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to early disease prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective air filtering aerosols, prange prevention plastic or glass, personal safety equipment or equipment because you may encounter a person who is infected with Quoid-19.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (OSHA) assumes that health and remediation workers, who deal with infected and suspected people with Covid-19 disease, are at high risk of infection. If employees are infected with Covid-19 disease and suspected of infecting particles in the air, they are implementing prevention procedures or collecting samples from them for testing, the risk of infection reaches a high level.</seg>
<seg id="9">The risk control measures that are suitable for these employees include engineering controls, such as negative pressure air conditioning rooms, and personal safety equipment suitable for the job.</seg>
<seg id="10">The spread of code-19 can have many effects on the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Employees may not be present to work because of the fear of becoming ill, the need for protection of others, and fear of becoming infected.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business routes may change. These routes may also change according to the demand for goods and also according to the means by which these goods are obtained (e.g., shopping during low business, or self-delivery to Delaware / customers or providing faster services via car / motorcycle).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the transport routes of goods from geographical areas that are severely affected by quad-19 may be cut. Preparation and response plans for the spreading disease can be used to guide safe measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">Plans include addressing risk factors related to various workplaces and jobs, including infection resources, risk factors from home, and social places and risk factors for high-aged and sustainable health status workers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, the plans identify controlled measures to address the risks and provide contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may require national and regional recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goals of responding to the spread of an infectious disease are to reduce the rate of disease transmission among employees, save people who are at risk of highly complicated health conditions, continue working activities, and reduce the side effects on other agencies in the activities / supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">The severity of the disease in the society in which business activities take place affects the reactions taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hierarchy of risk control measures is a characteristic that is widely used to classify risk control measures during effectiveness in working safety and health.</seg>
<seg id="20">In places where there is no possibility of eliminating the risks of quad-19, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, subsequent administrative controls and ultimately personal safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering controls, regardless of the small reliance on employee, are the separation of employees from the relevant risks of employment, and are probably the lowest cost-effective solution for implementing this work.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative controls are the changes in employment policies or procedures that are required to act by the employee and the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal safety equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of personal safety should be determined based on the risk of attention to the employee, be properly installed (such as, respiratory route), worn continuously and properly, checked regularly, maintained, and replaced as needed, and should be properly removed, cleaned and maintained or eliminated in order to prevent pollution.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States (OSHA) says there is a low working relationship with people and colleagues in jobs at low risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The primary measures of preventing the spread of disease, which are recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and complete hand washing, if the worker is sick, telling them to stay at home, preventing the transmission of disease through breathing, preparing pots for paperwork and used materials, preparing to make telephone calls or changing shifts if needed, preventing workers from using other tools and equipment, and keeping the working environment clean and disinfectant on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="27">The most important step in the safety of employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace is the rapid identification and isolation of possible infected persons on the disease.</seg>
<seg id="28">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory system symptoms should stay home for at least 24 hours until their fever is removed using fever-reducing or symptoms-eliminating medications. Holiday policies should be modified, employees should be allowed to care for sick members at home, and that employees are aware of these policies.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the United States Professional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the average risk of infection includes employees who are not infected or suspected of infection with people who are not infected or are in close contact at a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the transmission of the disease in the community around workplaces, or because of the infection that the person has recently made an international journey to the place where Covid-19 is widely spread</seg>
<seg id="30">These include employees who are generally in contact with people, such as in schools, high-risk working environments, or retail sales supermarkets or places where the number of customers is greater. Engineering controls for these and high-risk groups include installing air filters at an effective level, increasing the number of aerosols, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic curtains, providing quick services through customer service vehicles / motorcycles. Administrative</seg>
<seg id="31">Employees of this risk group require very low levels of respiratory alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone is sick on an aircraft, proper controls for the safety of the staff and other passengers, isolating other passengers and staff by keeping a distance of 6 feet from others, offering to wear a mask to the patient, and asking the patient to block his mouth and nose on paperwork during cough and prank.</seg>
<seg id="33">The associated cockpit passengers should use medical handguns once they are taken care of the sick passenger or touch the fluid or possibly contaminated surfaces, and if possible use other personal safety equipment in case the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Handmaids and once consumed goods should be put in red-coloured / hazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. Hazard controls on commercial vessels, including locomotives and other passenger vessels, include travel delays when someone is sick, and if someone has a fever and other symptoms of illness on the vessel should be separated from others and the medical staff on the vessel should be urgently notified.</seg>
<seg id="35">In principle, medical supervision is carried out in an isolated person's cockpit. For schools and child care centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a temporary school leave for cleaning and disinfecting in case a sick person does not come to school regardless of the social spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">If there is a low chance of reducing social transmission, social gap strategies should be implemented, such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or cancellation of church meetings or banquets in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between the tables, changing arrival and departure times, limiting / reducing unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office space for children with symptoms such as colds.</seg>
<seg id="37">When transmission of disease continues strongly in the local community, extended school holidays in addition to social gap strategies may be considered. From the perspective of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), rule of law employees who perform daily activities and affairs are considered to be low.</seg>
<seg id="38">The rule of law recommends authorities, who may necessarily contact infected or suspected individuals in Coved-19, to follow the relevant guidelines for personal safety, including proper equipment for emergency medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="39">If closely contacted during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their belts and military clothing on home-made disinfectant sprays before the second use, and follow the standard operating procedures / procedures for the protection and elimination of used personal safety equipment and the maintenance and washing of clothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) assumes that health and remediation workers are suffering from high and high levels of infection.</seg>
<seg id="41">Highly infected jobs include health care and assistance providers, laboratories, and medical transportation staff who suffer from Coveid-19 diseases and suspects.</seg>
<seg id="42">If employees are implementing prevention procedures for producing particles available in the air on suspects suffering from Coveid-19 disease or collecting samples for testing from them, the risk of infection reaches a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="43">Available particle manufacturing prevention procedures in the air include putting peppers into the body, cough alcohol method, bronchoscopy, some dental related procedures and examinations, collecting samples in large quantities.</seg>
<seg id="44">Highly infectious disease remediation tasks include staff who are engaged in preparing the bodies of people who have been identified as infected or suspected of Coveid-19 disease during death. If these staff perform a body examination, their infection rate increases significantly. Additional engineering controls for this group include separation of rooms for Coveid-19 infected and suspected patients, as well as prevention procedures for producing particles available in the air.</seg>
<seg id="45">The specific negative pressure aerosols may be appropriate in some health and remediation centers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Samples should be taken into account the previous measures of Biosafety Level 3.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be placed in a separate waiting period depending on the suspicious cases of Covid-19. In addition to other personal safety equipment, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respiratory equipment for employees who work on SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected patients at a distance of 6 feet and employees who perform particle manufacturing prevention procedures in the air.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 facial respiratory masks or better than these should be used in an extensive and written respiratory safety program. This program includes appropriate, training and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respiratory equipment are used for optimal safety and can facilitate the worker. The World Health Organization does not recommend cover / wave, since coved-19 is a respiratory disease. The disease is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The World Health Organization recommends only medical masks for examining personnel at the door.</seg>
<seg id="51">The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks, sunglasses, face masks, medical clothing and gloves / gloves for those who take respiratory samples of Coved-19 patients, take care of them or transport them from one place to another without performing the available particle manufacturing prevention procedures in the air.</seg>
<seg id="52">If a procedure to prevent the production of available particles in the air is performed, the surgical mask is worn instead of the N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.</seg>
<seg id="53">Because the global preparation of personal safety equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the use of personal safety equipment such as, clean windows, minimizing the need for personal safety equipment, only allowing those who perform the care of Coved-19 patients directly, only for specific necessary tasks, such as the use of personal safety equipment without the removal of a respiratory mask during care for the same patients, the monitoring and coordination of the personal safety equipment</seg>

<seg id="1">B. Coronavirus Disease 2019 or Coronavirus-19 is an infectious disease that causes coronavirus 2 with symptoms of severe acute respiratory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2">Normal symptoms include fever, cough, and asthma.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms are fatigue, organ pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell sensation, diarrhea pains.</seg>
<seg id="4">The onset of symptoms and symptoms of the disease is about five days, but it may take two to fourteen days.</seg>
<seg id="5">While many cases are common symptoms, some include viral pneumonia and deactivation of many bodily members.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million incidents were reported from 210 countries and territories around the world, of which more than 153,000 people died.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have been repaired. The virus spreads through small drops during close contact between people early on, often during coughing, pranks and talks.</seg>
<seg id="8">While these droplets are produced during breathing, usually these droplets float on the ground or other surfaces, but are not an infectious virus through great distances.</seg>
<seg id="9">People can also take the virus by touching the contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive for 72 hours on different surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="11">Within three days after the symptoms begin, the virus is highly prevalent and infectious, although the symptoms of the disease appear before or during the last stages of the disease also spread. The standard method of diagnosis of the disease is done through the reverse transcription polymerization chain reaction through the nasopharyngel swab / disease.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of a mask is then prescribed for those who are suspected of having a virus.</seg>
<seg id="13">The recommendations for the use of masks vary in the public, some officials recommend not using them, some recommend using them and some request using them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, there are no vaccines or anti-virus treatments for the treatment of Covid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Transmission of the disease is recorded locally in all six regions of the World Health Organization, in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">People who are infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may not have colds such as fever, cough, fatigue or asthma.</seg>
<seg id="17">Symptoms of an emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and stress, gangstia, severe sleep problems, red face and lips; it is prescribed to receive emergency medical attention with symptoms or symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unusually, the symptoms of the upper respiratory system include prenatal, invasive nose, or throat pain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gastroenterostinal symptoms, such as vomiting, vomiting and diarrhea / diarrhea have been observed in various percentages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Initially in some cases in China only breast impairment and heart rate have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In some cases, the disease ranged from pneumonia to pneumonia, inactivity of many body members and death.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is called the incubation phase.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation phase of Coved-19 is normally six days but may vary between two to 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5% of people whose symptoms appear on the virus take 11.5 days until the symptoms appear. Reports show that not all people who are infected with the virus appear on the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of carriers without these symptoms is not known, however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of people infected with the virus whose symptoms do not appear is currently unknown and is under investigation. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remained in hospital without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Chinese National Health Commission began recording no symptoms in daily incidents since April 1; on the same day, 130 or 78% of individuals infected with the virus did not disclose symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was a high level of virus in Bulgaria and also in Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speaking out loud until normal speaking releases a lot of drops.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that an unpleasant cough can transport mouth drops up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although the virus is not transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioviral transmission is possible and air collector devices that were installed in the corridor outside people's rooms have found samples that were positive for viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some medical procedures like pipe swallowing / laying and cardiopolymonary reactivation may cause aerosolysis of respiratory secretions and subsequently cause the spread of virus in the air.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although there are concerns that it is transmitted through sewage, the level of confidence of this risk is low. The virus is highly contagious when it has symptoms and symptoms in people, while there is a possibility of spreading before symptoms arise, and the risk may be low.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is clear how easy the disease can spread, one can typically infect two to three people with the virus. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the virus can survive up to one day on paper panels, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304), and 99% on copper can survive up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevertheless, survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and air temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and washing materials that can be applied properly are very effective; the related soap materials destroy the virus double protective cover, passive it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">As well as other solvents, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconite, are less effective. During a study in Hong Kong, the average sample of went was taken two days after being hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="39">In five of the six patients, the first sample showed that the virus was taken at a higher rate, and the sixth patient showed that the rate of taking the virus had increased on the second day of testing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Having severe acute respiratory symptoms, Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory symptoms, which was first separated from three pneumonia individuals related to the acute respiratory infection cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the relevant coronavirus in its nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Outside the human body, the virus is killed in homes using soap, which breaks down the surviving cover of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original prototype of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organs of the body that are most affected by coded-19, because the virus gains access to the host cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which accumulates more in the second type of pulmonary cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus uses a specific glycoprotein on the surface called a "spike / spike" (peplomer) and fibers up to the ACE2 enzyme and enters the related cells of this enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="45">Acute heart injury was found on 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan state hospital in China, and such incidents occur frequently in severe diseases.</seg>
<seg id="46">The rate of symptoms of cardiovascular disease during the progression of the disease due to inflammatory response and disorders in the immune system is high, but heart muscle injury may be associated with the ACE2 enzyme receptor / receptor in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors / receptors appear in the heart and perform their function in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the emergency care room individuals infected with Coveid-19 disease were found to have a high level of blood diving (31%) and an incidence of a diving in the vessels (25%), the cause of which is probably less awareness of the disease. Due to Coveid-19, adverse changes in the structure of the lungs were found in the diagnosis of dead bodies, and lymphocyte inflammation in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although the respiratory system of the SARS-COV-2 virus has an immune system for the ACE2 visible epithelial cells, severely infected patients on Covid-19 have high levels of systemic inflammation symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="50">Especially in the disease-causing GM-CSF secretor T-cells cells were shown to interact with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6 secretor monocytes and the identification or pathology of severe lung damage in patients infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="51">The presence of lymphocytic encephalitis in body figures has also been reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">The World Health Organization published many testing protocols for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">Arterial reverse transcription polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the standard method of examination.</seg>
<seg id="54">Generally, examination is carried out on respiratory samples obtained through the nasopharyngeal pep. Still, samples of nose pep or phlegm may also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">Examination results are achieved between a few hours and two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">A blood examination can be performed, but two blood samples are necessary in this examination, the second sample is taken two weeks after the first sample and the results of each sample require very little time.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists were able to spread a separate and genetic series with the form / origin of coronavirus, thereby enabling laboratories around the world to independently conduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect disease through the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which are an active disease and that a person is already infected with the disease and, yeah, it is found) were in development, but were not widely used.</seg>
<seg id="59">The proven accuracy and accuracy of Chinese experiments with examination is only 60 to 70% percent.</seg>
<seg id="60">The FDA of the United States approved the first test or examination of care for use at the end of this month on 21 March 2020. The Diagnostic Guidelines, published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical symptoms and epidemiological risk.</seg>
<seg id="61">Two-dimensional glass darkness is common in the environmental, contradictory and recent distribution of diseases.</seg>
<seg id="62">Subplural domination and crisp pivoting (variably filling the lobster curtain by filling the lung alveolar or hole), and integration may appear with the progression of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="63">Less data on the microscopic tape and pathophysiology of Quoid-19 is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="64">The key findings of damage identification when examining the body are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Macroscopy: Polyuresis, pyricarditis, pulmonary oedema and pulmonary oedema or the accumulation of fluid in the airwaves and tissues of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="66">Four types of severity or severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Normal pneumonia: Pulmonary oedema or accumulation of fluid in the airwaves and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large unknown pneumocytes, lymphocytic encephalitis alongside interstitial / hole inflammation and the structure of large multi-nuclear cells.</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: Inflammatory secretion in the lungs alongside adverse change in pulmonary structure (DAD).</seg>
<seg id="69">Adverse change in the structure of the lungs (DAD) is caused by the symptoms of severe respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxima.</seg>
<seg id="70">Repulsive pneumonia: Inflammatory secretion and polymonary interstitial fibrosis occurred in the lung holes.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: Widely available blood discoloration (DIC) inside the vein; Locorethroblastic reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures to minimize the chances of infection on the virus are to stay home, avoid overcrowded space, wash hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, protect the cleanliness of the better respiratory system, and avoid touching the mouth, eyes, and nose with unwanted hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">It is recommended by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to cover the mouth and nose with paperwork during cough or prank. In the absence of paperwork, it is also recommended to cover the mouth and nose with the elbow.</seg>
<seg id="74">After every cough and prank is found, properly proceed with the cleaning of hands.</seg>
<seg id="75">Also, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using face-covering fabric / fabric in public places to reduce the rate of virus transmission from a person with symptoms of the disease. The purpose of social distance strategies, by closing schools and workplaces, imposing restrictions on travel, and cancelling large public gatherings, is to reduce the rate of contact with many people infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the distance tracks it also comes that people live at least 6 feet (1.8m) away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is clearly no effective medication yet to prevent Coveid-19 disease. Although the disease vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key component of Coveid-19 virus prevention is an attempt to reduce the development of the disease to a higher level, known as "curved leveling / planing."</seg>
<seg id="78">The Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands several times for 20 seconds, especially after not falling into the toilet or when their hands are urban / contaminated, before eating and after cleaning their noses, coughing and pranking.</seg>
<seg id="79">The center also recommends the use of 60% alcoholic hand sanitizer / disinfectant, but only if soap and water are not apparently available. In places where the commercial hand sanitizer is not easily accessible, the World Health Organization provides two forms of local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">In this formula, anti-antimicrobial activity derives from ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen proxide is used in alcohol to help destroy bacterial eggs. It is "not an active substance for destroying the antimicrobial of the hands."</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerol is added as a reactive substance.</seg>
<seg id="83">People are administered with supportive care. These care includes fluid therapy, oxygen giving, and helping other vitally affected organs / members.</seg>
<seg id="84">The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of the virus wear a simple mask.</seg>
<seg id="85">Giving oxygen outside the body screen (ECMO) is used to solve the problem of destroying the function of the respiratory system, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="86">Personal hygiene and a healthy way of life and diet are prescribed to strengthen the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive treatments are useful for those who have normal symptoms during the early stages of the disease. The World Health Organization and China's National Commission of Health have published recommendations for the care of people who have been bedridden due to infection on Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="88">Intellectual and pulmonary experts in the United States have published recommendations for treatment as a free resource from various agencies, the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some healthcare professionals recommend prostamol (acetaminophen) from ibuprofen as the first use to eliminate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="91">To minimize the risk of virus transmission, precautionary measures should be taken, especially in health centers when performing procedures, such as inserting a pipe into the body or giving air to the patient by hand that can produce particles in the air.</seg>
<seg id="92">For health workers who care for people infected with the Covid-19 virus, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends placing a patient in an air virus separation room (AIIR), including standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal safety equipment during the plague.</seg>
<seg id="93">What are the prescribed items and devices: Personal safety medical clothing, respiratory alley or face mask, glasses / eye safety alley, medical gloves / gloves. Respiratory alley instead of face mask is considered preferable if possible.</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 respiratory tract has been approved for industrial sites, but the FDA has granted permission to use the recalled mask based on the official permission for use during emergencies (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">These masks are designed to protect particles such as pollen and vomiting in the air, but guarantee their effectiveness against a particular biological virus, are not without marked use.</seg>
<seg id="96">When there are no masks, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using home-made facial survivors as a final attempt.</seg>
<seg id="97">Many incidents of Coved-19 are not so severe that a mechanical respiratory ventilator or alternative way is needed, but in some cases this way is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="98">Some evidence suggests that pipe insertion should not be used during a respiratory pipe or a double-sided air pressure machine (BiPAP) in the nose to disable the respiratory system.</seg>
<seg id="99">Whether both of these methods will simultaneously benefit those who are severely ill, is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="100">Some doctors prefer to use a mechanical ventilator through the mouth because such a technique greatly restricts the spread of air particles than putting a respiratory pipe in the nose. Severe cases are typically greater in the elderly (who are over 60 years old, and especially those who are over 80 years old).</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries don't have enough beds in hospitals for each person. This limits the capacity of the health system to control the sudden rise in the number of quad-19 incidents that are required to become bed.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5% of patients were bedded in the ICU, 2.3% required mechanical assistance of the ventilator and 1.4% died.</seg>
<seg id="103">Approximately 30% of patients infected with kovid-19 in China are eventually hospitalized in the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">The mechanical ventriculator becomes even more complicated when the symptoms of acute respiratory disease increase further in quoid-19 and the giving of oxygen becomes even harder.</seg>
<seg id="105">Those ventriculators with the capacity of pressure control mode and PEEP should increase their oxygen giving levels, while the risks of pulmonary injury and pneumothorax related to the ventriculator also decrease.</seg>
<seg id="106">High levels of PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and many anti-virus drugs are being tested in clinics.</seg>
<seg id="108">It seems that Remedeswear has become a very hopeful forgiving medicine.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although the development of new medicines may last until 2021, many of the tested medicines are already approved for further use or are already being tested in an advanced form.</seg>
<seg id="110">Anti-virus drugs may be tested on severely ill individuals.</seg>
<seg id="111">The World Health Organization is urging volunteers to take part in tests on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA agency granted temporary official permission to give repaired patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a patient's life is severely and urgently under threat.</seg>
<seg id="112">This experimental treatment has not been experimented during clinical research to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, a mobile app was created in China to help combat the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are asked to write their name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect "close contact" and possible risk of infection using surveillance data.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of the other three users.</seg>
<seg id="117">If a possible risk is found, the app not only recommends self-quarantining, but also informs local health authorities. Large-scale data analyses on mobile data, log identification technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence are not used to monitor patient people who have communicated with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government requested security agencies to monitor the mobile data of people who may have a corona.</seg>
<seg id="119">This measure was taken to implement quarantine practices and to protect people who might interact with the virus infected.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom shared the collected mobile location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate the virus and prevent its spread.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia deployed figure identification technology to identify and identify quarantine breakers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said that he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government gave 48 hours of leave at the end of the week with the presence of more than 42000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">Estonian President Kirsty Kaljollid called for five solutions against the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">People may experience depression from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or from disease / virus.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor's speech as saying, "increased social isolation, tensions, health problems, stress, and economic downturn are the immediate storm of damage to people's mental health and wellbeing."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease may pass alongside the presence or absence of certain symptoms and other normal throat diseases such as normal colds.</seg>
<seg id="128">Normal incidents typically take up to two weeks, while recovery of severe and severe incidents may take three to six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="129">Based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk because of the severity of quoid-19 disease, but there is no relevant data on quoid-19. Some infected people with quoid-19 may be affected and cause pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In severely affected people, kovid-19 virus may quickly cause symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARDS), resulting in a functional crash of the respiratory system, spreading the virus throughout the body and causing an active crash of many members of the body.</seg>
<seg id="131">The related complications of Coveid-19, the spread of the virus throughout the body, blood flow irreversibly, damage to the heart, kidney and fight.</seg>
<seg id="132">Blood vomiting, especially during increases in prothrombin, has been found in 6% of hospitalized patients with quad-19, while kidney irregular activity has been observed in 4% of patients in this group.</seg>
<seg id="133">Approximately 20-30% of people saw an increase in the level of the fighting transaminosis enzyme, which was infected with codeine-19.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days besides five days in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="135">In addition, people who were transferred to ICU rooms, the average time between bedtime and death was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">According to a study of preliminary incidents, the average time for preliminary symptoms and until death was 14 days, the total time for patients becoming ill and until death was six to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">According to a study by the China National Health Commission, the death rate for men was 2.8%, while the death rate for women was shown to be 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="138">After death, histopathological examinations of pulmonary samples showed injuries of both lung tissues and inflammatory secretion of cellular fibromixoid in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in Nomositis.</seg>
<seg id="140">The image of the lungs resembled the symptoms of acute respiratory disease.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, increased troponin levels and related cardiovascular disease have been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to March data in the United States, 89% of bedside patients had already had symptoms. Access to medical resources and the social-economy of an area may affect the death toll.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of deaths from such a condition differ because of regional differences, but also because of methodological differences.</seg>
<seg id="144">A low number of normal incidents shown above the estimate of mortality rates can be the cause.</seg>
<seg id="145">Still, the fact that deaths caused by infected cases in the past means that the current number of deaths is shown to be lower than actually expected.</seg>
<seg id="146">Unlike smokers, the likelihood of being severely infected with the Covid-19 virus is 1.4 times greater in smokers and approximately 2.4 times greater than the likelihood of being bedridden and dying in the ICU. Concerns have been raised about the chronic effects of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">Hong Kong hospital officials identified a 20% to 30% reduction in the lung capacity of people who had been improved from the disease and there appeared to be organ damage in the lung scan.</seg>
<seg id="148">This may affect the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of the patient following his departure from the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="149">Until March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous disease causes effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">Depending on the behavior of other forms of coronavirus, there is likely to be a change in immunity, but after testing positive for coronavirus, there has been a report on cases where coronavirus has recovered from quoid-19.</seg>
<seg id="151">These incidents are believed to cause persistent disease worse rather than new antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="152">The belief about the virus is that it is a natural virus and originates from the zoo through a wide variety of microbes.</seg>
<seg id="153">The original source is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost entirely from one human to another.</seg>
<seg id="154">Research into 41 cases of Covid-19 confirmed, which was published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms of the disease was 1 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The World Health Organization's official publication showed the most previous date of the start of the disease symptoms on 8 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Many measures are used in common to determine the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="157">These numbers vary based on each region and over time and are influenced by the volume of examinations, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the disease, and the specifications of people, such as age, gender, and overall health.</seg>
<seg id="158">In late 2019, the World Health Organization used emergency codes of ICD-10 disease. The U07.1 code was approved for deaths that were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the laboratory and the U07.2 code for deaths that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory approval of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The number of deaths in the death-to-incident ratio falls on the number of cases diagnosed at a given time.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death-to-accident ratio globally as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9%.</seg>
<seg id="160">The numbers vary across each region. Other measures include the incident mortality rate which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with an infection, and the virus mortality rate which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with an infection (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from an infection.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not prepared on time basis and monitor specific people suffering from disease through accident recovery.</seg>
<seg id="162">While many infected people do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about why so many people are infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">A small village in the centre of the onset of the disease in Italy, Castiglian D 'Base, where 4600 people live, 80 (1.7%) died before the disease.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Ganglit, the disease spread because of carnival festivals, and spread to young class people whose mortality rates are relatively low and in such a way the death of all infected people with the disease on Covid-19 was not officially concealed.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German health system did not come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="166">With the assessment of blood donors, perhaps 3% of people in the Netherlands had antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">69 confirmed individuals (0.004% of the total population) have died from quad-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The effect of the plague and mortality rate varies in women and men.</seg>
<seg id="169">According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.</seg>
<seg id="170">Their risk for men is 50 years, with the gap between men and women only closing at the age of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">The mortality rate of men in China was 2.8 percent and the mortality rate of women was 1.7percent.</seg>
<seg id="172">The main reason for this gender difference is not known, but genetic and practical factors can be the reason.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-based immunological differences, whose prevalence in women is lower than in men, and the presence of several diseases at a time in women, such as hypertension in adulthood, can lead to an increase in their mortality.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from kovid-19 were men.</seg>
<seg id="175">Until April 2020, the United States government did not monitor the gender-related data of Coved-19 diseases.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral infections of Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women separately.</seg>
<seg id="177">A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, make up women, and they have a greater chance of becoming infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="178">The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "Coved-19."</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of the World Health Organization, Tedrus Adanom Gibriacos, explained that the CO in this name comes from Corona, VI virus, D disease and 19 for the time the disease first began and was identified: 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid referring to a particular geography (such as China), zoo, or a group of people. The name was chosen according to international recommendations aimed at preventing notoriety. The virus that causes covid-19 has symptoms of acute respiratory disease called coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition to this, the World Health Organization has used the "Quoid-19 virus" and "Quoid-19 creator virus" in its general statements.</seg>
<seg id="182">Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="183">During the onset of the disease in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, the World Health Organization gave the temporary name of 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory infections for virus and disease, according to the 2015 guide on naming places on diseases and viruses.</seg>
<seg id="185">Official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Because of the capacity limit in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers make healthy things and materials like nose cleaning cotton and respiratory parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">An example is that when a hospital in Italy required respiratory heads, and the supply company was not provided with them on time and on time, a new operating company built 100 heads in one night.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the first publication of Covid-19 disease, conspiracy theories about the source, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, misinformation and misinformation were collected and spread quickly over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans can transmit and spread viruses to certain animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Research has failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No medicines or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">International research on the vaccines and medicines of Coved-19 is continued by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched an "isolation test" to assess the effects of four available anti-virus combinations medicines in the hope of effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="194">There are no vaccines available, but many agencies are actively engaged in developing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Previous functions on SARS-CoV are benefited because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV -2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.</seg>
<seg id="197">The first strategy aimed at researchers is to develop a vaccine for the whole virus.</seg>
<seg id="198">The purpose of using such a virus, whether passive or dead, is to stimulate the rapid immune response of the human body against the new virus of Covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop subvaccines that are intended to make a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to subvaccines of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).</seg>
<seg id="202">Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies should be used for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of one vaccine in Seattle began on four volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains a genetically harmless code of virus that becomes infectious. Reliance on antibodies has been prescribed as a possible challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has generated much debate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Since April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">In seven tests already conducted an evaluation of approved treatments for malaria, four studies were conducted on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Several Chinese studies involved researching other diseased medicines, which reportedly conducted nine / 9 Phase III tests on radioactivity in many countries until the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">Until April 2020, a dynamic study of clinical development for the Coveid-19 vaccine and medicines was conducted. A large number of anti-virus drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of Coveid-19. Including remedicine, chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine, Lupinavir / Arthenavir and Lupinavir / Ritonavir as well as Inter Fera Beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">Since March 2020 there has been pilot evidence of the effectiveness of Remedeswear.</seg>
<seg id="209">Clinical progress has been observed in the treatment of repaired patients with reduced use of Remedeswear.</seg>
<seg id="210">Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was put under study in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">Still, a joint review of the research is being requested.</seg>
<seg id="212">Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">In addition to this, the Wohan Institute of Virology, while prescribing eating one gram dose a day, notes that eating this medication dose twice a day is much more dangerous and can be deadly.</seg>
<seg id="214">On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a request for emergency use of hydroxy chloroquine and chloroquine in accordance with the request of physicians to treat patients infected with coid-19. The use of interferon, ribavirin, or omephenoid against coid-19 is also mentioned in China's seventh print guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data shows that excessive use of ribavirin is required for the adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 in pilots.</seg>
<seg id="216">After demonstrating a low level concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitor, more research on nitazoxanide was recommended in the tests. The studies showed that pumping a high level of protein is important for the insertion of SARS-CoV-2 through transmembrane protease serine 2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="217">Research into chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine with acetromycin and without acetromycin has many limitations that have prevented the health community from using it in treatments without further research. Osletamycin does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in trials and does not have any apparent role in the treatment of covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms can complicate the health situation in the difficult and recent steps of Coved-19.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxy chloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties. After the completion of a small study the Chinese National Commission of Health also included toxicillizomab drugs in the treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide randomized test Phase 2 is conducted in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="221">The purpose of this examination related to serum fertilizer blood tests to determine cytokine trophies is to prevent such developments that are thought to be the cause of death in some affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="222">The interlucin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroid reflectorin cytokine symptoms based on previous incident research, CAR T cell, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="223">So far, there is no accidental and controlled evidence that tosilizomab can be considered an effective treatment for CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">The transmission of pure and thick antibodies produced from the immune system of repaired individuals to those who need it is under investigation as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.</seg>
<seg id="225">This strategy was tested for SARS without results.</seg>
<seg id="226">Inhibiting the virus is an expected mechanism of action that strengthens the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 by treating passive antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="227">But other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or phogacetosis, are also possible.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive treatment of antibodies including the use of monoclonal coupled antibodies are also being developed.</seg>
<seg id="229">Producing the serum of repaired patients, which involves retrieving parts of the blood fluid from healthy patients and using specific antibodies to the virus, can increase the number of them to spread rapidly in the body.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia have lowered the toilet paper giving threshold.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced bans on sales of toilet paper which is two or one package at a time in all stores nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a package limit on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These boundaries were installed in the form of notification messages on the input login sites and on the Facebook page of this chain.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the report, recipients were stored for fear of being quarantined due to Kovid-19.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also reduced the threshold for buying the toilet paper house to one package.</seg>
<seg id="7">These changes came after the passage of four packs at a time that were introduced by Woolworth and Coles consecutively on March 4 and 5.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles said in a March 8 media report that according to the limit of four packs, "most stores sell their goods within an hour after their arrival" and called the request "unprecedented," on the other hand Aldi called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Woolworths spokesman said sales had increased "significantly" last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costco Store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity limit to two last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">To mitigate the shortage, Coles has asked suppliers for larger packages and delivery increases, Wolverhouse has ordered additional stock, By Aldi has provided the stock for the planned special Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stock, but this is difficult due to a ban on truck timing by the local council.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects an increase in production prices, because suppliers are trying to meet demands and do something special.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, Aldi announced that after the store expired prematurely, some stores couldn't run that particular Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gerry Mortimer of the Queensland University of Technology says that the stores meet the stores every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that tilt papers are large items, and are in low quantity numbers, and when scratched, spaces in large cupboards become empty, giving a sense of reduced stock.</seg>
<seg id="17">Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Kluz and Woolworths have an idea that if objects in the cupboards are too many, and if objects such as toilets and sanitizers are too many, they may be at lower risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Red Cycled Tilt Piper Valley said last Wednesday that they had finished their reserve.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kimberly-Clark's reference to the manufacture of Clinics Tilt Tashes and Solaris Piper Sorbent in the News Dotcom report states that they have worked 24 / 7 to keep the supply intact.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Real Estate Site's Domain Dot Com report said that proprietary staff in Melbourne had first given TilePiper free of charge at the auction, due to the reduction in time on Libra Dot.</seg>
<seg id="21">The eighth panel in the Thursday edition of the Darwin newspaper NT news was used as a tilt paper.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Australian BBC reported March 3 already stores were not in the right to casual sanctions, and there are no plans to impose a ban on buying objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that the demand for other things is also high, which includes masks, sanitizers, drinking places, handwashes and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also in that way outside of Australia, on Sunday, Britsh on-line supermarket Andreas Tilt Piper observed the purchase of 12roll packs.</seg>

<seg id="6">This month we see ourselves in significant situations.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Code-19 plague is one thing that highlights our international human internal relationships and the responsibilities we have against each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We don't have the background of these challenges, but we know that our best response relies on some kind of international sympathy, cooperation and community building that places this at the heart of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">The collaboration and attention we have had among our colleagues through emails, calls, and online conversations is the remarkable credibility and trust of those interesting human beings who are lucky to work together with them.</seg>
<seg id="10">I can't thank you and be proud of your consideration of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, one person shared his thanks for our work with me.</seg>
<seg id="12">They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia, and as an important resource how powerful it is to be a symbol that is online and accessible to all.</seg>
<seg id="13">It becomes possible because of your work whether you leave this website open or take this money from colleagues or want to keep the community safe.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world more than ever now needs the information that Wikipedia provides.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is a moment where neither what we do or how we do it may show a meaningful impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to how we work together that will begin next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consistent with your work and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this conversation, we assumed that what we think would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and that would be the best way to keep the organization or organization stable and firm.</seg>
<seg id="20">With great intensity, we wanted to eliminate pressure and support our mission in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you want to dial it again, there is no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">The expectation of our daily work until the next news, is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="24">We don't have any holidays - if you can work longer than normal hours, the mission can use you.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yet, at the moment, the world is not very predictable, and for us your welfare is a priority, if you take care of your sympathy, shopping for home or visiting a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't monitor your time.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are sick, don't work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This should be done without saying, yet we tell you.</seg>
<seg id="29">No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedules to ensure that key parts of the work are covered.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you draw a Quoid-19 result positive, kindly inform Bryan T &amp; C Ops so that T &amp; C can help you and ensure your situation is properly justified by the management).</seg>
<seg id="31">Hourly workers are given their money in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have also said before and repeatedly respect our contractors and honorable staff for remaining committed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each will be paid based on their normal hours during normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you are sick and unable to work, also included.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to work, we support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people benefit from their work as a way of rotating their pressure around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">What we do is unbelievably reward forgiveness, especially at a time like it is now.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it means taking care of your own.</seg>
<seg id="39">The request is that you talk to your manager, know what to expect and calibrate yourself in this way.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some works are considered important.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are some things we need to do.</seg>
<seg id="42">The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp;, Safety and Capital Absorption teams (among others) perform important work that may also require further assistance.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will start a process together with all agencies to assess current objectives and shift our focus on supporting what is important for our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are a lot of agencies that do for us, we should all focus on the most important projects.</seg>
<seg id="45">It doesn't cause pains after going punchy for now.</seg>
<seg id="46">We don't have a plan to "double the time to provide equality" by the end of the plague.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is not expected of you to do this extra work to meet the deadline, because this work is now imaginative and unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the situation has changed, and we must work to determine new objectives and schedules.</seg>
<seg id="49">What happens with annual planning?</seg>
<seg id="50">To adapt to the expectations of our new reality and daily working hours, we plan to adapt to the schedule for delivering our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">Our intention is to predict an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time to budget and gives employees the opportunity to prioritize important work, self-care, empathy care, while replacing those who want to work with a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">The extension of the template highly reduces the volume and pressure of current planning work throughout the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will introduce our proposal to the board next week and update the delegation and teams on new measures upon receiving confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this field.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office status, sickness, and cleanliness</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we received news that our respective SF employees may have been infected with the Quoid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet, by taking a series of precautionary measures, we hired an anti-virus cleanup group to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They benefit from hospital-level anti-virus solutions to disinfect every surface as well as the lobby and lift neck that reaches our floor.</seg>
<seg id="59">The task of care in the building is using the protocol and using materials that help with the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We feel comfortable that the office will be properly prepared upon return.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our DC office is located in WeWork which has shared the Code-19 protocol with us and the relevant DC staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">Since last week, our DC office has moved completely to a remote location according to the guide shared with San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="63">As our respective colleagues in New York City understand, we discuss and talk about leasing a place in Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">These discussions continue, but there may also be delays.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some of our colleagues are the first to work in remote areas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Our long-term remote areas colleagues know that this may be some kind of discipline and consistency, and want to offer you some greetings:</seg>
<seg id="67">Limit the length of meeting time to one or two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If longer meetings are needed, consider how the meeting can be divided into several areas over the course of several days.</seg>
<seg id="69">Find out clearly the purpose of the meeting, should have an agenda, and send the reading material before the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="70">Download videos on Google Docs and Zoom Tools to create live help and collaboration and contact.</seg>
<seg id="71">Select a leader to create each meeting. Such is someone who will oversee the conversation on questions and follow the speaker's list and such someone who will help take note (or take note in common).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a cool microphone or headphone, send an email to the technology support section.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your welfare payment for breakfast meals.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the # remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Human Resources Activities team reviews the webinar-based Ergonomic Guide to support the increase in distributed work across the entire foundation.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked the recipients of community-related contracts to cancel public programs financially supported by Wikimedia, such as Editatons, until the plague was announced by the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="77">We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out activities based on their contract and that no one will be fined for delaying these activities and changing purposes.</seg>
<seg id="78">We will begin monitoring other guidelines on Wikimedia and other regional and community topic conferences next week.</seg>
<seg id="79">It seems that the general sense of the international community is depressed from the confusion, but is calm and comfortable in transparency and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">Going forward, CRT is working on creating a page in Metaweekly to create an atmosphere for the community to monitor the impact and track our relationship with them.</seg>
<seg id="81">Having an interview with Code-19 related topics</seg>
<seg id="82">We will send an invitation to your calendar on Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT, about a specific work meeting.</seg>
<seg id="83">We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions and find contact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are in this together and can help each other in this way.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition to this, you can continue to find information in this email address and find other important information relevant to Code-19 in Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">CRT will insert updates into these pages and keep all the information in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are also working to maintain continuous relationships with employees who are currently living in the most affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have questions about such travel, programs, major work processes, relevant coverage challenges, or something you need help with, you can without doubt inform CRT or work with it.</seg>
<seg id="89">We want to provide assistance and establish relationships if needed.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have confidential and sensitive information, kindly send it in an email to Brian Joden, head of global human resources operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">No change should be considered to abandon work and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rather, it is a recognition that at a time when our work and responsibilities should be organized in such a way that they were not previously organized.</seg>
<seg id="93">These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue our work, synthesize our activity with the help they need and synthesize the world with a service that they can trust.</seg>
<seg id="94">Our planned work will be waiting for us upon arrival in time.</seg>
<seg id="95">For now it is time to support each other and create an atmosphere for the important work that was probably encountered in the coming weeks and possibly months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need you in order to achieve this goal, and ask you to keep the thoughts of yourself and your families, thus you will be ready and sensational when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now kindly - wash your hands and don't touch your face!</seg>
<seg id="98">Catherine, CRT (Amanda in, Amy V, Brian Jay, Doreen D, Gregory Vee, Jim Vee, Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and other members of the leadership team (Grant II, Heather W., Jim Vee, Janine U, Lisa S., Robin O, Ryan M., and Toby N.).</seg>

<seg id="1">Updating the diagnostic standard data of COVID-19 "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" is required</seg>
<seg id="2">On 6 February 2020, our 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infectious disease has published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease, and these guidelines provide our experience and good information to combat this common infectious disease worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease of coronavirus, our awareness and knowledge is increasing regularly based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experience; therefore the diagnostic and treatment strategy is constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter we gave an opinion question about our guidelines and proposed a new diagnostic standard for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," this is based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh prescription), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, currently officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus name was laid down as severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a common infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and on 06 February 2020 it is published online in military medical research.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.</seg>
<seg id="9">But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experience our awareness and knowledge is increasing regularly; therefore the diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), January 16, 2020 and until March 3, 2020, have published all seven versions of which some parts have been modified heavily.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now our guidelines have achieved an idea by Zhou et al, they have suggested scoring that is based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and is valuable information for this common infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">We confirm their excessive work and express our gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, data on their work should also be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines and recent studies for COVID-19 (seventh prescription).</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the history of infectious disease identification should be combined with two substances of clinical evidence to form a comprehensive analysis, or should meet three substances of clinical evidence if there is no obvious history of infectious disease identification.</seg>
<seg id="16">History of infectious disease identification: (1) a history of travel or accommodation in Wahan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where they have reported COVID-19 cases before the onset of the disease in the past 14 days; (2) a history of contact with patients with nuclear acid (positive examination); (3) a history of contact with patients from Wahan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where they have reported COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days before the onset of the disease; (4) a history of cont</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) infection of COVID-19 with a picture; (3) the number of white blood cells displayed normal, decreased, or the number of lymphocytes decreased early in the onset.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspicious case based on a substance of pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time positive examination of PCR for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral total genome series indicating high resemblance to new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies in serum examination and SARS-CoV-2 for IgM antibodies; or SARS-CoV-2 for specific IgM antibodies from negative to positive, or material</seg>
<seg id="19">We can see that a real-time examination of PCR for nuclear acid in the respiratory tract or in blood instances has been added in the second (18 January 2018) and third (22 January 2020) versions.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pathogenic identification of blood vessels was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then the evidence of serology was added to the seventh edition.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to investigate the quality of finding high levels of nuclear acid for rapid diagnosis, and examples from the respiratory tract including taking blood examples, which added to the presence of differentiating examples, and supported bringing a particularly positive result to an approved standard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Besides this, there is additional evidence that we should treat normal symptoms and unsymptomatic patients carefully.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the data on the working maps of Zhou et al. Should be updated, because those without clinical symptoms rated them as "low risk."</seg>
<seg id="24">The scoring system must also be verified in other clinical work and studies.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, we hope to come up with more direct evidence and ask readers to give their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="26">To identify "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," we recommend to follow and comply with the new guidelines of our countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team has periodically updated their guidance to offer help.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bangladesh reports the deaths of five other people caused by Covid-19, the largest number of deaths a day.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the death of five other people due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths caused by the virus in a single day there.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, the Bangladesh Department of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) released a report on people affected by the krona virus, which included 114 people who are still present with the virus, and 33 cases where the disease has not been healed and it remained in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="5">In total there have been a record number of deaths of 17persons.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora said that the dead included four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dr Meerjady said that two of the dead people were above the age of sixty, two people 51 to 60 and one people 41 to 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that two of the victims were residents of Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 global plague on 11March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hospital officials told the Anadolu news agency that one of the dead was Jalaj Saif al-Rahman, the chairman of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was in Kuwait Metro Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an online video on Saturday, Abdul Qadir, minister of land roads and bridges in Bangladesh, said that public transport will be closed for more time than previously announced plans.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first common transport was closed on March 2 and the plan was to terminate on Saturday April 4.</seg>
<seg id="13">But bringing in essential items such as medicines, fuels and food was still open.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">There are methods in testing laboratories for the 2019 Corona virus Respiratory Disease 19-COVID and 2-SARS-CoV available virus through which the presence of the virus is diagnosed and the production of antibodies in existence against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="2">The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed through RT-PCR which diagnoses the RNA of the corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In March 2020, the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified as a target for post-infection drugs.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is used to identify the most innovative and functional bladders.</seg>
<seg id="5">The detection of antibodies (serology) may also be used to diagnose and also to meditate people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, also those who had the symptoms of the disease, and also those who had the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="7">Accurate mortality rates and public safety rates can be determined through the results of this testing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to limited tests, until March 2020, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus in its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, a country had not even tested a 3% share of its habitat, there were policies in most countries that would not test casual libertarian symptoms, such as Atali, Netherlands, White and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">This diversity also affects the mortality rate of reported incidents, which may have been highly estimated in some countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are usually available from a few hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The performed RT-PCR test on throat samples is only valid during the first week of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">The virus can then disappear from the throat and enter the glasses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Alternative samples are taken from their deep respiratory pathway for those who are being tested in the second week using stretching tubes or coughing substances (sputum).</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the first PCR tests was conducted in January 2020 at the Berlin Charity in which a series of real-term exposure polymeric interactions (rRT-PCR) was used and provided the World Health Organization with the distribution of 250,000 thermal thermometers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UK also conducted a test on 23rd January 2020. On 28th January 2020 in South Korea, a company called Cognibeuch developed a clinical scaling device to determine temperature based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was one of the first companies in China to obtain a license to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 temperature diagnostic device from the China National Health Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the 2019 Novel Crona Virus (2019-nCoV) Precise Time Diagnostic Device (RT-PCR) to its public health laboratories through internationally recognized resources.</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the three genetic tests of older test kits caused inappropriate results due to impaired performance and a test disruption at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">Until February 28th 2020, tests carried out on two potatoes were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted so that government and local laboratories allowed tests.</seg>
<seg id="21">These tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration through an emergency use permit. U.S. business laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">On 5th March 2020 LabCorp announced that the COVID-19 tests are accessible throughout the country using RT-PCR.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostic also provided access to COVID-19 tests across the country on 9th March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantitative restrictions were announced, the collection and processing of samples must be carried out according to the requirements of the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="25">The COVID-19 tests in Russia were developed and launched by the State Research Center for Virus Identification and Vector Biotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="26">The test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Maintenance on February 11th 2020. On March 12th 2020 Mayo Clinic announced the diagnostic testing of COVID-19. On March 13th 2020 Roach Diagnostic Corporation received a license from the FDA for such testing that will be executed on a high scale in three and a half hours, then approximately 4,128 tests will be performed in 24 hours through one machine.</seg>
<seg id="27">On 19 March 2020 the FDA authorized the emergency use of the Abbott m2000 test to Abbott laboratories; similar licenses were also granted by the FDA to some laboratories such as: Halloween, Lib Corp and Termo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21st, 2020, Safeed had also obtained a 45-minute test emergency use license by the FDA.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA accepts tests in which thermal nuclear acids are used instead of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">This method is able to diagnose positive results in at least 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes because there is no need for intermittent temperature cycle range in this method.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost 18,000 grains from these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate the production of these machines to carry out 50,000 tests a day. In Taiwan, the discovery of such a method of testing is underway in which an individual antibody is used to combine the nucleoscopic protein (N protein) of the corona virus, there are hopes that testing through this method will take as long as 15 to 20 minutes like an influenza rapid test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 Literature Review concluded that "breast radiography has little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the findings of CT [calculated tomography] may be available even before symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="33">Two-dimensional glass darkness is common in the environmental, contradictory and recent distribution of diseases.</seg>
<seg id="34">Subplural domination and crisp pivoting (variably filling the lobster curtain by filling the lung alveolar or hole), and integration may appear with the progression of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wahan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, most of its reactions are covered with other pneumonia and disease processes.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology suggests that "CT should not be used for first line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19" until March 2020, WHO proposed the following definitions of cases:</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response against antibodies is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These cases are used to provide care for people, determine the immune system, and diagnose the disease of people who were seen within the first 7 days or until the subsequent symptoms. Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or through the Care Test (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">Highly automated systems in many clinical laboratories will perform these capabilities to perform tests but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">CLT is commonly used for screen blood samples, although continuous samples are used for imaging the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, a blood sample is typically taken through the hole of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="42">Unlike the PCR method, pre-testing is not necessary. On March 26, 2020, the FDA did not name twenty companies that provided notification to the agency as required and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.</seg>
<seg id="43">Until 7th April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA through an emergency use license. In late March 2020, Eurovision Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Epitope Diagnostic Laboratories received European approval for their test devices, which can diagnose IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and therefore the viral RNA is much faster than the PCR test.</seg>
<seg id="45">Typically antibodies are diagnosable after 14 years of coronary appearance. In early April, the UK found that none of their purchased diagnostic devices were useful.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube," thrust them, send them back and receive a test result after a while. The UK NHS has announced that it is running a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of a patient if coming to hospital or discharging an ambulance is required. For suspected cases tested by drive for COVID-19, a health care specialist uses a sample us</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the National Association of legal health insurance physicists said on March 2 that it has a capacity of approximately 12,000 tests through planet diagnosis and 10,700 tests were taken in the previous week.</seg>
<seg id="48">When a dessert is requested by a doctor, the costs are carried out by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, testing was proposed in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">The total number of tests conducted until 26 March 2020 was not known because only positive incident figures were published.</seg>
<seg id="52">A preliminary survey of the laboratories showed that as of the week of 2020 / 12, a total of at least 483,295 tests were conducted and including the same week 33,491 sample incidents (6.9%) were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Israel, researchers from Tekken and Rambam Hospital at one point developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients, conducted through the integration of multiple samples, and further tests were conducted in the event of a positive incident</seg>
<seg id="53">By monitoring the manufacture by BGI founder Wang Jin and taking 5 days, modeling showed that cases in Hubby had increased by 47% and the associated cost of solving the quarantine would have doubled if this test capacity had not been raised in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="54">Wuhan's laboratory was immediately followed by Hu Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities of China.</seg>
<seg id="55">The capacity of the tests on 4th March 2020 was 50,000 tests per day. Open source, designs shared by Origami Association have been published that can test patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests up to 1122. These balanced schemes can be performed in small laboratories without the need of machine liquids.</seg>
<seg id="56">By March, insufficient amounts of cognition and insufficient amounts had become a problem for mass testing in the EU, UK and United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">Some authors have been forced to explore protocols of sample preparation that include temperature samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further examination. It was announced on March 31 that the United Arab Emirates is now examining more of its population on top of the man for coronavirus than any other country, and has reached the level of population examination that has examined more of its population.</seg>
<seg id="58">This was through a combination of ability from the patient's location, and the purchase of a mass examination laboratory across the population from the 42 and BGI group (based in China on the emergency discovery laboratories of wi "yes - yan").</seg>
<seg id="59">The developed laboratory in 14 days is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and at this level is the first laboratory in the world to operate outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">The genetic profile of the corona virus was established in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States by targeting different parts and performing different testing procedures.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization sent a German policy to countries with low incomes and no resources to produce worms themselves.</seg>
<seg id="62">Germany's policy was published on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not established until 28 January, which postponed existing tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the validity of testing worms at the beginning of the plague, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough worms to meet the requirements and recommendations of conducting tests by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">In contrast, experts say that the widespread possibility of testing in South Korea has contributed to the decrease in the spread of new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Large-scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories was established by the South Korean government over a period of several years.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization demanded that testing programs be accelerated which is the best way to slow the development of COVID-19 plague. The high demand for testing due to the development of the virus has led to the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories across the United States, and the supply of soybeans and chemicals has been tightened.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported a problem of accuracy in their inspection worms.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, testing worms developed by the CDC had "flaws" since then the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented them from conducting tests by private laboratories. Spain purchased testing worms from the Chinese company Shenzhen biotechnology company, but it was later discovered that the results were not correct.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company responded that the false results may be due to a problem in collecting samples or the misuse of worms.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish ministry said they would return the worms that had false results, and instead would receive different inspection worms from Shenzhen Bioeconomic Company. The Czech Republic, which purchased any test worms from China, gives 80% of the worms in them false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test worms from China after which the results were found to be false.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matthews suggested that it should be converted into Danube. Atish Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that there are "high levels of mistakes" in the test kits purchased from China by Turkey and did not "use them." The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced at the beginning of April 2020 that the purchased kits are not eligible to use.</seg>
<seg id="71">Tests whose results are positive, patients were quarantined and followed by those who had contact with those who had positive results of SARS-CoV-2, whose results are positive.</seg>
<seg id="72">The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, which is the first death region of COVID-19 in Italy, carried out double checks at a distance of around ten days with the total population being about 3,400 people.</seg>
<seg id="73">Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the discovered patients were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">Because of limited travel to the community, new diseases were completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Following sudden contact, with restrictions on internal trips, inspections, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus disease in Singapore is running much slower than in other developed countries, and there are also no serious restrictions like forced closure on restaurants and retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="76">Most of the ceremonies were cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay in their homes until 28 March, but the schools were reopened on time after the 23 March holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">A number of other countries like Iceland and South Korea also managed the disease with random contact tracking, internal travel restrictions, inspections, and quarantining, but the rate of lockdown or curfew was lower.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that in relation to the number of deaths, the mortality rate is very low in countries that have carried out multiple examinations, the reason may be that these countries are better able to identify those with only little or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to 16 laboratories of the World Health Organization for testing approval.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the 16 client laboratories, 7 are based in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the chart below, the column "positive as% of examination" is effective from the country's examination policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">A country that only examines people visiting hospitals is higher than the country that conducts examinations of all people, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things are equal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Overall incidence of rapidly spreading corona virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">Cases of Corona virus aggregate disease (COVID-19) show similar occurrences in EU / European Economic Area countries and the UK which confirm that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 plague is spreading rapidly across all countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and care units should increase their preparedness for increasing COVID-19 patients who will require health care and particularly intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 31 December 2019, an unknown ecology incident was reported in Wuhan, China's Hubi province.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 20 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the new krona virus to the reported factor now known as severe respiratory syndrome krona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since that time, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Corona virus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">So far the evidence is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have fewer diseases, for example short breath diseases such as pneumonia or without pneumonia, and many are healthy.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Ca 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops extremely serious illnesses that require a hospital bed while the remaining 6% of cases experience serious illnesses that require intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The death of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we evaluate the overall incidence of COVID-19 incidents in each EU / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) country and the UK and compare it with the Hubi province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK in Italy during January 31- 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in UK and European Union / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, COVID-19 spread geographically and the COVID-19 plague dynamically follows this country in the rest of the world currently.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 disease as a global plague.</seg>
<seg id="15">At Euro Surveillance 2020 on March 5 Spiteri et al, the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Europe according to the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on January 24, 2020 in returns from Hubi, and Wuhan, China by France.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were found in all 30 EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom, while between 31 December 2019 and that date there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, in 17,750 cases only 1,441 deaths were reported from Italy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Getting the total number of Covid-19 cases and plus incidents</seg>
<seg id="19">At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the confirmed case of COVID-19 is numbered in every country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) broadcast daily at 8: 00 pm.</seg>
<seg id="20">This information has been used to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK, and it is compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an indication of the widening of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day total incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period of 1 January - 15 March 2020 in each EU / EEA country and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">We presented the total number of confirmed cases per country on 15 March 2020 at 8: 00 pm compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Cases of COVID-19 in UK and European Union / EEA countries</seg>
<seg id="24">Within 14 days this process has been followed by multiple incidents of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK generally followed by Hubi Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then greatly increased around 28 February 2020 (supplemental materials).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is often caused by a rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but other EU / EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increasing condition of overall cases of COVID-19 (complementary substances).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and the UK compared to these in Italy for the period of January 31-15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="28">This indicates that, at eight o'clock on the morning of March 15, 15 other EU / EEA countries and the UK had already reported similar cases with Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="30">The severity observed in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the disease of plague in all countries progresses comparatively.</seg>
<seg id="31">Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, differences in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries, different protocols for patient selection and follow-up testing that should have been tested for COVID-19 approval.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these areas had already reached their highest potential.</seg>
<seg id="33">Documents of admission in COVID-19 cases in the hospital and / or intensive care unit are currently available at the EU / EEA level only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (the information is not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they must be systematically collected to complete current surveillance documents / records that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 11-2010 showed a large difference in the availability of concentrated care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal to over 100,000 beds in the population.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 12 - 2010 care and intermediate care beds are 12.5 per 100,000 population).</seg>
<seg id="37">Modeling scenarios related to health care capacity centralization, with estimates of each EU / EEA country and hospitals in England the incidence of COVID-19 increasing from the capacity of concentrated care beds &gt; 90% risk, presented in the sixth ECDC of the COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.</seg>
<seg id="38">As cases have so far been clustered in some areas in EU / EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care units usually determine the local occupation population, so information about cases and care beds should best be provided in the name of field units. Level 2 for statistics (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU / EEA and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Countries, hospitals and care units should thus provide themselves with health care for the continued social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, which requires them to provide health care, and particularly intensive care, the type of care that occurs in the affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As indicated in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, rapid, functional and comprehensive behavior is necessary to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a skilled condition to a reduced wavelength, since the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to design, accept and implement their imagery if not implemented ahead of time.</seg>
<seg id="42">An accelerated risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the effects of the disease to minimise the impact of global plague.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a short window of opportunity while countries have the potential to increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health care stress.</seg>
<seg id="44">Failing to do so, it is possible that the health systems of other EU / EEA countries will face an increase in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zonotic origin / sources of human corona viruses</seg>
<seg id="2">Variability and adaptation have developed coordination for thousands of years between crona virus (CoVs) and their host, which also includes humans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before 2003, two human (CoVs) HCoVs were identified as the cause of a small disease, such as the typical cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are metallized coins that indicate how devastating and life-threatening the infection of HCoV can be.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the end of 2019, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China has once again turned CoVs into a significant place and surprised us with its high transmission side but reduced the psychological impact compared to its sister SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">HCoV infection is zonosis and understanding the zonotic origin of HCoVs will serve us well.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoVs originate from shoppers where they are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="8">Intermediate storage hosts of some HCoVs are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identifying animal hosts has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigating CoV-hosted interactions in animals may also gain an important perspective on CoV-hosted disease in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this overview, we provide an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on their discovery history and the main sources of their zones and intersection transfers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compare different HCoV viruses with the combination of virus evolution and genome.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease is discussed in this section.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the evolutionary effects of the virus on successful hosting needs and the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Crona viruses (CoVs) belong to the family of crona viruses, which contain a group of crushed, positively felt, only global RNA viruses.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses, which have the largest genome in the mass of RNA viruses 26 to 32 kilobas and are called "CoVs" due to crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoVs contain non-cutting component genomes that share the same organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately two-thirds of the genome has two large wide query open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designed nsp1 ~ 16</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N)</seg>
<seg id="21">Access proteins related to a series are encoded by different numbers of CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four embryos (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta CoV), in which the beta-CoV genera has multiple HCoV and is divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Polygenetic evidence has shown that shoppers and mice act as gene sources of multiple alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reserves of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently exceeded different types of barriers and some have been raised as important human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, seven human (CoVs) have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="27">Other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause common symptoms, such as common colds and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing low respiratory system infection in relatively many patients with a high chance of developing high respiratory system infections.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first patient of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the gross itching of the common cold disease in the mid-1960s.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, a lot of data has been collected through extensive studies in HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, the concept was widely accepted that being abused with HCoVs is generally harmless until sarcasm is established.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS disease developed in 2003 is the most devastating incident in current history, and has infected more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% of cases of accidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection caused a persistent infection on the Arab Peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 2019 novel (HCoV 2019-nCoV, which was then renamed as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm sounds and the world should be prepared for the next plague of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoVs have zonotic origins from shoppers, mice or pets.</seg>
<seg id="38">The line of evidence supports the evolutionary principle of all HCoVs from shoppers, where viruses are well adapted and non-diseased but show great genetic diversity</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 disease presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the main resources of the zones of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors of species jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">This may make it easier to guide or search for a SARS-CoV-2 reserve, intermediate and extended animal host (s), which has important signs in preventing future spellers.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this overview we present zonotic origin, intersection transmission and disease allocation of HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we highlight the common topic and discuss how parent viruses of HCoVs are particularly non-pathogenic in their natural resource host but become ill after the intersection transfer to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">We are also looking at the evolutionary state of HCoV in which increased transmission ability often comes with decreased disease.</seg>
<seg id="45">The ongoing results of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed in this section.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E B814 was inhaled from the mat of patients who had a normal person's disease, various CoVs were isolated into a variety of diseased animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, chain, cat and dog.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the past decade, seven HCoV have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief description of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.</seg>
<seg id="50">The first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory disease patients during 1966, and was later applied to develop WI-38 lung cell lines.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, bronchitis, throat pain, fever and cough observed in 10 ~ 20 percent of cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from a serial passage in the brain of the muscles of the membranes and subsequent pulmonary mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 abnormality appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which in other areas are inseparable from microbes with respiratory disease triangles such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and it is transported during the winter season in warmer climates.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, the injection time of these two viruses is less than a week, and the infection of approximately 2 weeks prolongs / stretches.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to a human voluntary study, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a handful of immune patients showed severe low influenza of the respiratory system.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atopical pneumonia," is the first widely recognized pulmonary disease caused by HCoV in human history and the ecological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="60">As a result of SARS disease 8,096 cases were reported with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to high prevalence, it was estimated that each case develops into approximately 4 seconds, the duration of appetite ranges from 4 to 7 days and the weight lifting of the virus appears on the tenth day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS - CoV are primarily infected with myelagia, headache, fever, suffering and disease, followed by dysphenia, cough and respiratory discomfort are symptoms of delay.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lymphopenia, liver / cervical activity tests, and elevated crystalline cones are typical laboratory of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="64">Reducing alveolar damage, growing epithelial cells and increasing macrophages are also seen in sarcasm patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to tattoo inhalation, multiple organs including the stomach apparatus, liver / chest and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine storms, which may be fatal especially in patients with poor immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of an index patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, extensive efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was initially found in teenage children, adults and immune patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">The presence of coriaza, conjunctivitis, fever, and pulmonary antimicrobial is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study described a pattern of isolation of the basic virus in an 8-month-old boy infected with pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.</seg>
<seg id="74">It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 contributes to approximately 4.7% of normal respiratory diseases, and its high occurrences occur in early heat, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibitory laryngitis, also known as Crop.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asymmetric disease.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing minor respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All these four socially acquired HCoV have become well normal in humans and are generally less likely to cause more pathogenic diseases, while the incidence is caused by unknown causes such as the incidence of more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63. It was recently reported that shorter respiratory breath infections in China cause.</seg>
<seg id="80">Generally, when these HCoVs gain the capabilities to transmit effectively and protect themselves constantly in humans, they also become less dangerous or ill.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS - CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in 2012 who developed acute pneumonia and spinal failure in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="82">While the majority of laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, import cases have sometimes been reported in various European countries and Tunisia near the second end.</seg>
<seg id="83">Another secondary disease occurred in South Korea in the year 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe spinal failure, which is very specific for Mers in diseases caused by HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high of 34.4%, making Mers-CoV the most fatal virus known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From mid-December 2019 to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients identified as being related to SARS - CoV-2 disease were found in Hubei province, Wuhan, China.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization declared an ongoing incident of low respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% raw / unconfirmed death cases.</seg>
<seg id="91">Significantly, the case of death in Hubi, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dysphenia.</seg>
<seg id="93">Diarrhea was also observed in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop into severe respiratory syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly versatile due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are clustered in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a lesser cancer disease but is more transmittable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="97">Asymptomatic issues infected on SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs and the difference shows many advantage differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the duration of incubation and HCoV infection are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this section, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general condition of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is present between SARS-CoV and the four socially acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show shapes that are most commonly seen during infection with HCoVs taken by the community, including presenting non-specific, moderate or even non-existent symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting ways to show the characteristics of both HCoVs and SARS-CoV obtained by the community.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, the transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least significantly higher than the HCoV obtained by the community.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the ability to transfer SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passage in humans as seen in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, unlike other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 should be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">Although the ovarian oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some cases can be illustrated by future studies.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may describe the seasonality as it is in cases of HCoVs obtained by the community.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the SARS-CoV-2 form will be effective for the recent fate of ongoing COVID-19 after passage in humans including its transmission, disease and persistent spread.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms are well applied to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptation to these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV plague.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans. And humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="115">In order to make this happen, HCoVs should be repeated sufficiently in humans to allow applicable changes that combat host limitation factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the more persistent the SARS-CoV-2 disease persists and the more people infect it, there is a greater chance that it will become fully familiar with humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well known, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">For many years, four of the community's acquired CoVs flow into the human population, becoming the common cold in immune subjects.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal stocks.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, high cancer - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well accepted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to maintain and spread in their zonotic reserves and seek the opportunity to develop suspicious human targets. Potentially through one or more medium and advanced hosts.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has a shape that is similar to both SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the acquired HCoV of the four communities.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is highly transferable as HCoVs obtained by the community, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is much less pathogenic / pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It will be observed whether it will fully apply to humans and circulate in humans without a host of reservoirs or intermediate animals.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the main animal resources of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definition and characteristics of a host of HCoVs evolution, natural resources, intermediate and expanding</seg>
<seg id="127">An animal serves as an evolution host of HCoV if it is closely related to the ancestors who share a higher homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.</seg>
<seg id="128">The old virus is often well-known and non-diseased in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, a reserve host keeps HCoV consistently and for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host has a natural disease and is a natural host of HCoV or as a parent of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV is introduced to or around humans before it is introduced to the new host, it does not apply well to the new host and is often a disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a zonotic source of human infection and play a hosting role by transmitting it through the virus and then transmitting it to the human being by expanding the amount of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">HCoV can carry out a dead end infection if it cannot protect its transmission in the middle host.</seg>
<seg id="134">In contrast, HCoVs can synchronize with a moderate host and create even longer-term intrusions.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural resource host.</seg>
<seg id="136">Given the epidemiological data it has revealed that the case of the SARS index has a history of interacting with animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent research indicated that animal dealers have higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general public.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the living animal markets niqab ciots (Pigoma larvata) and raccoon dogs are first known for transmitting SARS-CoV - like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="139">This was indirectly supported by the fact that there was no further SARS report after killing all the idiots on the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, it has been reported that duplicated fish from wild or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without reaching the livestock market, suggesting that duplicate mature fish may only be a medium-sized host but not a natural reserve of CoV- SARS.</seg>
<seg id="141">Remarkably, since 80% of different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that smaller types of antibodies may also serve as a medium-sized increase host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="142">It all looks like a SARS-CoV death end host.</seg>
<seg id="143">Looking for a natural host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related CoV evening snapshot, called SARS-related Renault CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is available in Chinese Horseshoe Shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="144">These shoppers are positive for genome sequencing of SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 and SARS-CoV antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="145">These and other nucleotide CoVs share 92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies have established the basis of a new idea that exactly hosts human-created human courgies.</seg>
<seg id="147">Several saris types of corona viruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening shootings, but with the exception of a virus designated as WIV1 none of them can be separated as a live virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a SARS-CoV recipient or inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="149">Not taken as an immune example of evening shooters are built into WIV1 which uses this virus as a vulnerable to evening shooters, intelligent and human ACE2 to enter the cell.</seg>
<seg id="150">It is noteworthy that the serum or room of SARS repaired patients was able to inhibit WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related seriousness of SARS-CoV in evening showers, with 95% nucleotide series similarities.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although there are many similarities between these two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not the closest parent virus of SARS-CoV and the evening shoppers are not the closest guard host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Philogenetic analysis and analysis classifies MERS-CoV into the same group as the evening shooter CoV-HKU4 and the evening shooter CoV-HKU5.</seg>
<seg id="154">Both the evening shoppers CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host recipient, Depeptidal Peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.</seg>
<seg id="155">RNA-a series of MERS-CoV-related RNA polymers philogenetically identified in Europe and Africa are closely related to the synthesis of evening-shaped beta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in the wild evening heroes.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV and its closest relatives have only 87% nucleotide series similarities to the evening superhero CoV-HKU25.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore the evening shoppers probably won't host a close guard of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arab tears have had positive results for MERS-CoV-specific inhibitor antibodies, similar to the Arab Middle East tears in many African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">Exactly the same as the virus found in humans, the living MERS-CoV has been isolated from the nose fluids of Arabic tears, through which the lawn bears that the tears are the main guard host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also worth noting that for experimentation in MERS-CoV infected tears generally observed mild symptoms but the virus infection was more widespread.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth noting that infected tears not only sprinkle viruses through the respiratory tract but also through the immune - mouth, which is also the main way to sprinkle the virus in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, the questions still remain instead because many confirmed incidents of MERS have no history of any contact with tears before the onset of symptoms, apparently no human transmission or transmission is given ratio to unidentified pathways involving unidentified animals which have MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the evening superhero CoV RaTG13 separated from the Renolophus Aphenius evening superheroes.</seg>
<seg id="165">In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV incidents, the series disagreement or removal between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too much to determine the reproductive relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">This means that evening shooters probably won't host the SARS-CoV-2 blaze distance guard unless in the future almost exactly the same evening shooting virus is found.</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 indoor host animals should be among the wholesale market of Hunan marine food purchased and killed wild animals, to which point many of the early incidents of COVID-19 were associated, which is a sign of the potential incidence of transmission of animals not to humans.</seg>
<seg id="168">A number of recent studies based on the methogenomic series have given the idea that at-risk small animals known as dessert sister (Manis Yavanica) may also have genetic beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These genomes of the new penguin CoV have a combined range of nucleotide from 85-92% of the homology with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are similarly more closely related to RaTG13 which resembles approximately 90% of the level of the nucleotide series.</seg>
<seg id="171">They accumulate viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic cell into two sub - family groups, one of these has a very similar recipient mixing area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, which is 97.4% similar to the amino acid series.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a very different way, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD are very different, although the genome-wide homology range is measured.</seg>
<seg id="173">A previous study on pimples with the disease also reported finding instances of viral disease from the lung, which is similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study has benefited from distinguished ways of integrating and manually forming so that three levels of genome series can be produced whose synthesis is approximately 86.3% full-length of the viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">We can't even ignore the possibility that Ant Sister is one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host genres.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, currently, due to a different range of differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the ants sister SARS-CoV-2 associated with beta-CoVs, there is no direct supporting evidence of the origin between the ants sister and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the ant sister SARS-CoV-2 that is associated with beta-CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="178">The path to growth of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found in livestock, ants, and other animals.</seg>
<seg id="179">While a high range of homology has been found in RBD gangs between SARS-CoV-2 and the ants sister, beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, have a high-level genome-wide range of homology between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly anticipated that the ants sister is due to the growth of excellence intermediate integration between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD groups.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another proposal then bridges the reproduction between ants sister SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in three wild animal species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a promoter of growth power, back production among beta-CoVs is more widespread.</seg>
<seg id="183">The judgment on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is far from over.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to this the animal origins of high-level patients HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been found from smoked CoVs, while the genetic viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in the mice family.</seg>
<seg id="186">It has been reported that a smoke CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the smoke of three colors of North America showed its close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically associated with another smoky CoV, whose name is Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which has been found in Ghana, while there is also suspicion in the family of tears as an intermediate host.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, a summary of the currently available information about the origins of HCoVs came in Figure 1 and Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="189">Historically, phylogenetic analyses have provided evidence for the transmission incidence of HCoVs between animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">When around 1890 HCoV-OC43 from domestic animals came to humans, infectious respiratory diseases were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of transmission of HCoV-229E among animals has little explanation.</seg>
<seg id="192">Smokeless alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between these there is an alpha-CoV of alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="194">A number of different evidence supports evidence of the transmission of viruses between smokers and humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans in the environmental area may not have had contact with alpaca smoke.</seg>
<seg id="196">However, humans have a close relationship with Alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, HCoV-229E related to smoking alpha-CoVs are different and do not cause disease in smoking, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory infections in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">As a result, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, it cannot be ignored the possibility that Alpaca takes HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, smoke is a direct source of human sickness viruses including insane dog virus, Ebola virus, Napha virus and Hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">It is therefore not very surprising that it may transfer smoke directly to HCoV-229E to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">On the other hand, while smoking alpha-CoVs act as a source of inheritance of HCoV-229E, alpacas and a buck tear may be a moderate host that transmits viruses to humans, as it shows in the case of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is an excellent example of smoke spreading between animals and tears from a book to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The origins of the growth of MERS-CoV have been identified in the first phase and have been supported by recent findings.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is clear that smoke for spreading between hereditary fragments and animals is a rich source of viruses among animals.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long lifespan, extremely crowded, close social relationships and powerful ability to fly are all supportive situations where smoking can be a proper broadcaster of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has moved into the tears of a book over the decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It has become a good habit with these animals that have been transformed from a medium host into a stable and natural resource.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very low levels of disease and maintains very low levels of change in these animals.</seg>
<seg id="210">This irregular transition to humans is a phenomenon and humans are the host of the end of MERS-CoV because the spread cannot continue.</seg>
<seg id="211">Unlike tears in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the contribution of the ants sister, if any, is otherwise in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, ants sister beta-CoVs are highly patient in ants sisters.</seg>
<seg id="213">In the case of SARS-CoV to families of cats, they may be a host of beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="214">In subsequent studies, different possibilities of publishing SARS-CoV-2 for animals from animals to humans should or should not be acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, smoke may be the source of the same host near the SARS-CoV-2 related virus.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may have a similar environmental shared area through cascades or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, Ant Khoran may be a horrific intermediate host to which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with this virus through casualties and eating hunting meat.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many animals, including family animals, may be weak against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">A survey of families and wild animals is necessary for antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="221">The third, as stated above, may have occurred in the third animal recombination and habitation of SARS-CoV-2 which has interactions with both animals and ants.</seg>
<seg id="222">The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also underway.</seg>
<seg id="223">Apart from the different types of host animals, there are also three important causes in terms of virus to facilitate the transfer of CoVs to animals.</seg>
<seg id="224">First of all, their high change rate in RNA back production mostly.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other RNA single-string viruses, the estimated change rate of CoVs may range from "medium" to "high" levels, and the average rate of change is ~ 10-4 per 2 areas per year, and this depends on the CoV phase of the new host.</seg>
<seg id="226">CoVs contain the refinement of exorbonucleus, resulting in the removal of high levels of change and decrease or not sustained.</seg>
<seg id="227">The remarkable thing is that the nucleotide analog readsware has been identified that inhibits the reproduction of CoV through this exorbonucleus and RNA-related RNA polymers.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remedswire is very encouraging anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactions to be tested clinically.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the change rate of CoVs compared to their host is nearly one million times greater.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, the change rate increases when CoVs are not a good habit with the host.</seg>
<seg id="231">A higher rate of change than SARS-CoV, it is observed that the rate of change of SARS-CoV-2 is lower, which means a higher rate of habit with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It may have been inhabited with a very close host similar to previous humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also related to MERS-CoV, which has become well used to tears from a buck.</seg>
<seg id="234">Theoretically, it is impossible that genetic change will prove ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and anti-virus soon.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the major in CoVs uses increased flexibility in the transformation and recombination of the RNA genome, therefore increasing the likelihood of joint - growth between animals, when the condition becomes appropriate is useful for the arrival of new CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="236">Its support includes 3 ′ encoded open reading frames at the end of the genome and a more specific function of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, CoVs convert irregular and reversible templates during RNA reproduction through a specific "prescription options" mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="238">In a host that serves as a joint character, the change of wire during the CoV's RNA recording occurs frequently.</seg>
<seg id="239">Similar to high levels of full-length and subgenomic RNA cells may be combined back together to produce new CoV cells.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recovery synthesis has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and also in animal CoV groups such as smokeless SL-CoV and smokeless CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Transfer-related virus-hosting connections</seg>
<seg id="242">Aside from the three viral causes mentioned above, the transfer between animals is another important factor in the viral relationship with the host recipient.</seg>
<seg id="243">Therefore, the back synthesis of SARS-CoV has been taken as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive options during transmission incidents between animals.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on comparative analysis between human and cat SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV, it is thought that in different hosts, especially the S protein undergoes rapid habitat changes in RBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">Typically, the S protein RBD of a CoV communicates with the cellular recipient and is powerfully selected by the host's antibody response.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD in the patch of S1 is among the 318th to 510th amino acids that connect with fellow recipients for human ACE2 and inside the virus.</seg>
<seg id="247">SARS-CoV, RBD can identify ACE2 recipients of various animals, including smoke, cat, mouse and pillar dogs, allowing the spread of the virus between animals.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, it has been observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD were different from human and wild cats and 4 of them are located in the recipient-connecting scheme to interact with the ACE2 recipient.</seg>
<seg id="249">The cat's SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T changes in its RBD, which may increase the willingness of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 recipient.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, changes to both of these amino acids may be important to help humans make a viral habit.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is worth saying that SARS-CoV-2 has similar joint cellular receptors to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the willingness to interconnect S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study of cryo-EM has shown that high levels of interest from 10 to 20 shafts, as long as there is between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine if any of the fellow recipients might be required to emit SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="255">It is amazing that HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2 but with a different part of the S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are many recipients of HCoV, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyllitide cialic acid for HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">After spreading between animals from their animal host they may also be considered to make a successful habit of these CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular recipients, the result of the spread of HCoVs between animals is also managed by another host's need and restriction actions.</seg>
<seg id="259">The distinction of these host proteins between humans and natural resource hosts of HCoVs such as livestock, tears of a buck, mice may be an obstacle to the spread between animals.</seg>
<seg id="260">For a successful spread between animals HCoVs must pass through the requirements of the host and eliminate the causes of the host limitation.</seg>
<seg id="261">Therefore, the molecular reactions in this important area of virus-host relationships still need to be identified and explained.</seg>
<seg id="262">Using modern CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-wide unscrupulous examination of SARS-CoV-2 hosting requirements and disruption reactions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Coming to the middle of new HCoVs: Back to the original place</seg>
<seg id="264">Many types of smoking CoVs provide many opportunities for the arrival of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">Therefore, smoking HCoVs are the source of the gene deposits of HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="266">Additionally, rapid change and genetic back synthesis also contribute to the growth of HCoV and act as two key steps in this series.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-fertilizing genes enables it to severely alter the viral phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="268">Among the fellow proteins of SARS-CoV, it is thought that ORF8 is important in getting used to humans, as the smoking viruses related to SARS-CoV have been monopolized but have been found to encoding different proteins of ORF8.</seg>
<seg id="269">Containing a 29-nucleotide that is characteristic of SARS-CoVs can be found in the onset of human infectious disease viruses.</seg>
<seg id="270">This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a normal change in encouraging host switching.</seg>
<seg id="271">Besides this, SARS-CoV has a history of a possible back synthesis whose families are Alpha and Gemma-CoVs, where small areas of RNA polymers forced back together have been found.</seg>
<seg id="272">Back synthesis locations are also known in nsp9, multiple nsp10, and nsp14 parts.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, it has been shown that the infectious disease of MERS-CoV has experienced a back combination among different families, which occurred in the tears of a book in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to this, back synthesis phenomena of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been observed in other HCoVs, in these HCoVs combine back with another CoVs of the animal in their non-natural formation genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial options may play an intended part in the transformation of viral genomes, to a large extent resulting from preferred pressures, such as getting rid of viruses by the host's safety system.</seg>
<seg id="276">One example of these effects is the loss of one full length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, which is due to the removal of two nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="277">While full ORF4 may be observed in smoke and camel viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV interconnect shows an individual nucleotide, resulting in change.</seg>
<seg id="278">As a result, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of options in the stocks of their hosts as well.</seg>
<seg id="279">Disease without symptoms or only minimal symptoms have been found when smokes are infected with CoVs, this indicates a joint habit between CoVs and smokes.</seg>
<seg id="280">It seems that smokers are automatically and physiologically well used to CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, the effect on the swelling reaction activity in the swelling activities actively reduces the activation of pathology by CoVs.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition to this, the activity of natural killing cells in drugs is prevented due to the above activity of natural killing cell receptors NKG2 / CD94 and low-level core equivalent I grade molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen types (ROS) produced due to the high metabolic activity of the smoke may prevent both the reproduction of CoV and the effects of refinement by exorboniclase, therefore suppressing the options for production when the very patient virus is transferred to a new host.</seg>
<seg id="284">Very sick CoV viruses may change with back synthesis, and take new proteins or protein forms to make a habit with the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">Therefore, it is not unlikely that three new HCoVs have arrived in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">CoVs are non-patient in their host's reservoirs such as smoke and tears or cause deficient illness.</seg>
<seg id="287">They generate back quickly without showing the powerful response of the host safety system.</seg>
<seg id="288">Therefore, there is a mystery as to why unsymptomatic patients are seen and what causes severe cases in human infection.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are primarily due to high safety response activity and cytokine storm, meaning the longer the safety response is powerful, the greater the lung impairment.</seg>
<seg id="290">In other words, the immune response in unsymptomatic patients is separated from the reproduction of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="291">A similar safety response isolation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of anti-SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="292">The reaction of anthropologists in smoke is particularly powerful.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, giving Type I interfaces in the initial phase of human infection in SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, the activation of NLRP3 enfluamasome in the drugs has effects.</seg>
<seg id="295">With this argument, the inhibition of NLRP3 enfluamasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">Coming up between SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came up between.</seg>
<seg id="297">While it has been found that a smoky beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is also a smoky bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">While cats and other animals have been found in markets that have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, a nearly intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is not known.</seg>
<seg id="299">It has been found that ants sister beta-CoVs are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that ants sister beta-CoVs may be as intermediate hosts or ants sister beta-CoVs may participate with gene fragments in the resulting instance of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately made by a human.</seg>
<seg id="301">CoVs have once again become back common due to the recent arrival of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of CoVs in livestock and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the importance of the transfer of HCoVs to human beings and the importance of animal reserves.</seg>
<seg id="303">General evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the main smoke and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that the SARS-CoV virus is a link between humans and cats in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the killing of cats could have been unsuccessfully eliminated by the infectious disease of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="305">Based on a similar argument, ants should have wet markets to prevent animal spread, because ants sister beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of links have been found.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 spreads to humans through ants or other animals should be explained in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in the tears of a book.</seg>
<seg id="308">These tears serve as a central source of transportation as well as meat, milk, leather and wool products as an important resource for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all tears to control MERS, as was done in wet markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to prevent the spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be chosen to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV alongside other steps of controlling the spread for tears.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we are unable to destroy the virus, new genotype may occur and spread.</seg>
<seg id="313">There are many species of CoVs in wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="314">Smoke CoVs in particular have many species with animal potential.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities to change and resynthesize these animal CoVs, resulting in the arrival of new CoVs that are more prevalent in the future and / or are deadly in humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be avoided so that the relationship between humans and animals needed to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="317">A preparation and response plan must be developed for the problems of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, there have been a lot of viruses in the world for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural resources until the opportunity to spread is handed over.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although smoking has many forms that contribute to the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with smoke and other wild animals can be reduced if people are given awareness to be away from them.</seg>
<seg id="321">Continuous monitoring from animals is necessary to gain awareness of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of homes, which will prove useful in preventing future spread from animal to human.</seg>
<seg id="322">As a result, the most effective way for humans to prevent animal virus is to stay away from the environmental area of animal viruses "natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="323">A number of pieces in the animal mystery of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if the smoke spreads to the genetic SARS-CoV-2 ant eaters, it would be interesting to see if under which circumstances the smoke and ant eaters may share the same environmental area.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if smoke has a direct contribution to the spread to human beings, it should be determined how humans come into contact with smokes.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third animal acts as the main intermediate host, how it interacts with different animals including humans, livestock and ants, it should be made clear.</seg>
<seg id="327">Consequently, since many animals including domestic animals may be weak against SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental spread should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="328">Whether it is a smoke, ant sister or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or genetic viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural homes in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continuous research in this field will provide clarity on the growth pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control outcomes of COVID-19 in humans.</seg>
