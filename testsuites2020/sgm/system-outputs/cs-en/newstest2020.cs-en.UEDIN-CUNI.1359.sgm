<seg id="1">Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted material informs about the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajA Supervisory Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax management and the use of the VIES information system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so revenues from value added tax affect not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the procedure of the tax authorities in examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions carried out between individual Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the VIES system enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by these payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mismatch between the VIES data and the data in the VAT return submitted by the payer should alert the tax authorities to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefits of the parallel checks carried out consisted not only in the exchange of information on the progress of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax, but in particular in examining the use of the VIES system in checking the application of the right to an exemption from value added tax in intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lessons learned in the implementation of parallel controls are beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in carrying out further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax for the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of scrutiny: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of roles under VIES for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO, the Czech Republic) and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded the Cooperation in Control Activities on 12 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implemented parallel control actions of the "Value Added Tax Administration", included in the control activity plan of the SAO, the Czech Republic for 2005 under No 05/19 and "Control of the procedure of the tax authorities in spiral, control and recovery of dane from the pridé value and pleneni roles within the VIES system on the fabric of information media by the member regions of the ECO", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR SAO under No 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel control actions carried out were in the nature of coordinated checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The outcome of the joint coordinated control was drawn up within the meaning of European Implementing Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated check was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (SR).</seg>
<seg id="20">The two parties have contracted to provide each other with information from public sources, the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to investigate business transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, South Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, Financial Office in Cologne, Financial Office in Teplice, Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, Financial Office in Tábor, Financial Office Brno III, Financial Office in Znojmo, Financial Office in Zlín, Financial Office in Šumperk, Financial Office Ostrava I, Financial Office for Prague 7 and Financial Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the SR was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with Expoziturami SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Tax Úrad Bratislava I, Tax Úrad Komárno, Tax Úrad Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Úrad Zvolen, Tax Úrad Dolný Kubín, Tax Úrad Košice II, Tax Úrad Košice V and Tax Úrad Michalovce.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of checks:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax (VAT) after the integration of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited period for coordinated control was the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel control actions In the EU Member States, an electronic VIES system is in place, allowing tax administrations to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and makes it possible to check in the country of destination whether the purchaser has properly admitted and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The checks identified differences in the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The recapitulative statements shall indicate the values of deliveries of goods to other EU Member States, the values of the services provided shall not be included in the recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States listed in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities shall transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Slovakia, data from recapitulative statements filed by Slovak payers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Slovak Tax Directorate (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of the supply of goods and the value of the provision of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values given in the recapitulative reports with the values of the supply of goods according to VAT tax returns and to identify their possible differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, the values of goods delivered and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on the common row of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, the system does not make it possible to automatically identify differences between the values of the supply of goods under VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the values of the supply of goods in VAT tax returns makes it possible to use the results of the comparison of data when checking the exemption of goods to the EU from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="39">The supplied data from the recapitulative statements submitted by the payers in other EU Member States are processed into the CLO and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods mentioned by the payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, these figures are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences to examine.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) will determine the quantified differences between the values of delivery and the acquisition of goods must be examined by the tax authorities, and hand over a list of these cases to the locally competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that for the most significant derogations, it will be examined whether VAT has been awarded at the correct amount when acquiring the goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">The audit also highlighted some of the problems in the VAT management system of the complications caused by the different reporting of intracomonality transactions (i.e. the supply and acquisition of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summary reports are made in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reducing the period for which recapitulative statements are made for one month, together with the shortening of the deadline for processing them, would allow earlier access to the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">Tax administrators would thus be able to examine more effectively whether VAT was awarded at the correct amount in intracomonarian acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, filing VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax year (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer has reported the same values of the supply of goods to the EU in the recapitulative statement as well as the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">The differences between the values of delivery of goods reported by EU payers and the values of the acquisition of goods reported by payers from the Czech Republic or SR were due, among other things, to different reporting of data on intracomonality delivery and acquisition in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in the recapitulative reports, or the reporting of intracomonant supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than intracomonality acquisitions in the tax return on the purchaser's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">A unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activity of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also aimed at examining selected intracomonality transactions carried out between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, for which there were doubts about their realisation or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the SR found, among other things, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">the tax authorities have declared in their VAT returns in order to unlawfully obtain excess VAT execution of intracomonant transactions which have not actually been carried out;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax entities reported intracomonality supplies in carousel transactions in which there was a deliberate multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw on excess VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">the suppliers reported in their VAT tax returns and recapitulative statements the intracomonality supply of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">the suppliers made an intracomonality supply of goods exempt from VAT for tax entities that were not registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers reported intracomonality supplies in their VAT tax returns at a higher value than those declared by the purchasers of the intracomonality acquisition, in some cases the VAT was declared in the wrong amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">The findings of the inspection showed that the VIES system provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">In particular, tax administrations should pay extra attention to the rigorous examination of the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES data and the use of all information in tax procedures.</seg>
<seg id="62">The issue of value added tax after the entry of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">After joining the EU, internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within EU territory were abolished.</seg>
<seg id="66">The VAT administrator was the relevant financial or tax office until 30.4.2004, with the exception of the import of goods and occasional bus transport in the Czech Republic, where the tax administrator was the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In connection with the adoption of the new Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), or Act No. 222/2004 Z. z., on Pridanej Value Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 222/2004 Z. z."), the VAT administration switched the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU Member States from customs offices to financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="68">The delivery of goods in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of the goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">The delivery of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the delivery of goods that have actually been shipped or transported to another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="70">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 64 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., it is an exempt taxable transaction with a right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">The supply of goods in the Slovak Republic under the provisions of Section 8 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z. is considered to be the supply of tangible property in which ownership rights are changed.</seg>
<seg id="72">The transfer of goods belonging to a taxable person from the country to another Member State shall also be considered a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under Paragraph 43 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z., the supply of goods from the country to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the person acquiring the person identified for VAT in another Member State is the person identified for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="74">The acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 16 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of the goods which are sent or transported by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Czech payer buys goods at a price without VAT and his obligation is to declare VAT in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 25 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set out in Section 73 of this Act, he is entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">By acquiring goods domestically from another EU Member State, in the Slovak Republic, pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z., the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported by the purchaser by the supplier or the acquirer or on their behalf to the country from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">The tax liability in the SR arises to the payer when acquiring goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State under the provisions of Section 20 of Law No 222/2004 Z.z.</seg>
<seg id="78">The payer may deduct VAT under the provisions of Section 49 of Law No 222/2004 Z. if the tax is applied by it when acquiring goods in the national territory from another Member State pursuant to the provisions of Sections 11 and 11a of this Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">Trilateral trade means, according to the provisions of Section 17 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., or Section 45 of Act No 222/2004 Z. trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States, where the subject of trade is the supply of the same goods between the three persons.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intracomonarial transactions means the supply and acquisition of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="82">VIES</seg>
<seg id="83">In order to check the application of the VAT exemption entitlement to intracommunity supplies of goods, a VAT information exchange system has been established within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows tax administrations of EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and vice versa whether the acquirer duly admitted and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State shall develop its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">National systems work on a common principle and are interconnected through the EU's common communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was linked to an automated tax information system (ADIS), in the Slovak Republic, with the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "APV DIS").</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems use financial or tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in tax and fee management.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU member country receives information on tax entities that it would not have been able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is to combat tax evasion and tax losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State, within the internal organisational structure, provides for a central unit in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the administration of VAT, the so-called CLO (CLO (Central Liaison Office).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the International Cooperation in the VAT Administration (MF CLO) was established.</seg>
<seg id="95">The CLO function in the Slovak Republic is performed by the Slovak Tax Directorate, the International Administrative Cooperation Unit (DR CLO).</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments inter alia communicate with EU foreign administrations, in particular in the area of exchange of information under the VIES system, the exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of EU tax administrations, the coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, the verification of tax identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as the VAT Code) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to examine a certain intracomonality transaction or to obtain other information relating to a particular tax entity, the financial or tax authorities shall send requests for information to the EU via the IF CLO or DR CLO to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these applications, they obtain from the requested Member States information which they can use to correctly determine VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information are mostly sent between the CLO of EU Member States in electronic form, using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was aimed primarily at examining selected intracomonality transactions carried out between the two states and on the level of use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation obtained in the form of international cooperation by financial or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">The SAO, the Czech Republic requested the SAO of the SR to examine in 30 cases the commercial transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">The SAO SR requested the SAO, the Czech Republic to examine in 10 cases commercial transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">Examination of intracomonial transactions was found, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, the Czech Republic has asked the SAO of the SR to examine the procedure of the tax administrator, to whom a response to the request for information was sent.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak Tax Office applied via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of goods (footwear) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer worth 2 847 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="108">The Financial Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer had stated the acquisition of goods of this value only in an additional VAT return and had delivered the same goods back to Slovak tax entities worth CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">Based on the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the locally competent tax authority recognized the Slovak contractor in full the right to excess VAT deduction incurred, among other things, on the basis of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">This tax office did not provide information on suspicion of reexport to tax authorities locally competent customers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">These will trigger further screening of trading activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">The Czech tax administrator applied through the SCAC form to examine the delivery of the technological line to SR worth CZK 4,850 thousand in the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax procedure carried out in the SR showed that only part of the technological line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">When examining this case, the SAO of the SR found that VAT on the taxable transaction carried out was granted by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850,000 in the VAT return (hereinafter referred to as "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO, the Czech Republic further found that the Czech payer reported an excessive VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 for that quarter in his DAP, which was created by applying a VAT deduction on the purchase of this technological line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">Based on the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities had created a commercial relationship in order to improperly obtain an excess VAT deduction, questioned the execution of the taxable supply and did not recognise the Czech payer part of the right to deduct CZK 647,000.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">The Slovak tax administrator applied in 2004 via the SCAC form to examine the supply of goods (copiering machines) to a Czech payer worth 24 246 thousand Sk made in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Slovak payer purchased these goods in November 2002 in SR from another tax entity worth 29 667 thousand. Sk and subsequently sold it to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity applied an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax year.</seg>
<seg id="122">In a tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not file DAP for the 4th quarter of 2002 or for the period following.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO of the SR found that the Slovak tax administrator, on the basis of the result of the tax audit, did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of 5 541 thousand. Sk applied in DAP for the month 11/2002 and set the tax liability in the amount of 1 750 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted an exemption from VAT on the export of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the acquired goods for the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire goods (director) from SR worth 3 767 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, DAP did not serve and VAT for the months 7 to 12/2004 was assessed ex officio in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator asked, via the SCAC form, to check whether deliveries of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic were made, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In reply, the Slovak local tax authority sent a copy of the invoice, bills and a notice to pay the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO of the SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with a VAT deduction claim for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administrator assessed the response to the request for information received from the SR as evidence proving that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the basis of further investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority in the Czech Republic will request a review of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (wooden products) including to an American company that stored these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of that free zone was listed on the invoices as the recipient of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, for example, an American company purchased chipboard cladding worth USD 57,600 from a Slovak payer (at a unit price of USD 100/piece) which it placed in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred the property rights to the Swiss company, worth USD 14,400 (unit price USD 25/piece) and the goods were exported back to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the free zone area on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax administrator initiated tax inspections of individual tax years 2004 and 2005 from the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="141">Examination of the transactions carried out was requested by the Czech locally competent tax authorities through several forms of SCAC.</seg>
<seg id="142">Individual answers gradually created a picture of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from Slovakia and the Czech Republic in carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO SR, found that there was deliberately a gradual reduction of the value of goods in these trade relations.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the information obtained, the SR Tax Directorate concluded that in this case the carousel trade is free pricing (i.e. the import of undervalued goods and its overvaluation by domestic companies located in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a breach of the VAT Act in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="145">In the current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be prevented as they meet all the conditions of the VAT exemption law.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">The Czech payer's VAT registration had been revoked on 12 July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="148">On 27.10.2005, that body became a taxpayer again on the basis of a voluntary VAT registration application.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Czech tax entity entered into DAP for the month 8/2005 (i.e. the period when it was not the VAT payer) the value of the purchase of goods (a polygraphic printing machine) from the Slovak Republic in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to the supply of goods from the Slovak payer in the amount of 1 530 thousand Sk, which the Slovak payer listed in DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify the mentioned delivery using the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier did not prove how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the Czech taxpayer does not cooperate with the tax administrator and does not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax administrator for the purpose of examining the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer entered the summary report for the 3rd quarter of 2004 a supply of goods worth 956 thousand. Sk to a tax entity from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">The VAT number of the Czech entity was identified by the VIES system as erroneous.</seg>
<seg id="157">By verification in the payer database, it was found that such a DIČ was never assigned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was a performance of electrical works on real estate in the Czech Republic, it was not a delivery of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but a service provision.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity told the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, the Czech Republic, by asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the tax entity listed on invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not acknowledge the tax on the services received from the Slovak entity and did not acknowledge the tax on the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">Local investigations and tax inspections have not been carried out with the Czech entity, his current stay is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity had become the adoption of the service as a VAT payer by law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">The Slovak payer entered the summary report for the 3rd quarter of 2004 delivery of goods worth 1 055 thousand. Sk to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was a performance of electrical works on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">It was not about delivering goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but about providing services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, the Czech Republic, asked by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the supply and a local investigation was carried out with it in order to examine the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that it was indeed not the acquisition of goods in the present case, but the acquisition of services, which was also reported by the Czech entity in a regular DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">The tax office further found that the Czech entity, as a result of a poor procedure in calculating VAT, did not pay VAT at the correct amount for the 3rd quarter of 2004 tax year.</seg>
<seg id="173">The taxpayer shall submit an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">Asked by the locally competent tax authority, the SAO of the SR found that the Slovak payer had misstated the provision of the service in the recapitarian report and would be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech taxpayer voluntarily registered as a VAT payer from 10 March 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For the first quarter of 2004, DAP submitted with a high turnover on both entry and exit.</seg>
<seg id="178">The tax administrator of the locally competent tax administrator initiated the tax proceedings, the entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, so due to the suspicion of involvement in the carousel trade, he was assessed in VAT amounting to CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="179">Another DAP has not filed this payer.</seg>
<seg id="180">Due to the failure to comply with his obligations under the law, his VAT registration was revoked on 4 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to data from the VIES system, the entity was to acquire goods worth 7,846,000 from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to examine the execution of these deals, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">When asked by the locally competent tax authority, the SAO of the SR found that the manager of the Czech company in the witness statement denied carrying out the transactions examined and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">On the basis of the tax procedure carried out in the Slovak Republic, the intracomonality delivery to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be entitled to an exemption from VAT and will be charged with VAT on the amount mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer was to acquire goods (workwear) from SR in the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of 39,970,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in this quarter only in DAP for the month 3/2005, worth CZK 11,292,000.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax authority carried out a local investigation with the entity to examine the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">As the company did not produce any documents, nor otherwise substantiated the execution of taxable transactions, on 9 June 2005 the tax administrator assessed the VAT in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to doubts about the acquisition of the goods, the tax authority sent two requests for information to the SR in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the reply to requests for information, the tax administrator in SR had doubts about the execution of business cases as well as the implementation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO of the SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out with the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated control, the locally competent tax administrator carried out further investigations concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic and at the same time an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of being involved in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions in goods (working clothing) were made between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak payer No.1 supplied goods to Czech payer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No. 3, who delivered it back to SR to payer No. 4 (see diagram No. 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech payer No. 2 was to purchase goods (workwear) worth CZK 4,847,000 from Slovak payer No 1 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods worth CZK 17,050,000 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the SR on 25 May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="203">In response, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the execution of business cases as well as the implementation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8 June 2005, a request for information was received at MF CLO from SR concerning goods worth 16 575 thousand. Sk, which was to be delivered in December 2004 by Slovak payer No. 1 to Czech payer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side demanded to check whether Czech payer No 2 had actually accepted the goods, admitted it in DAP and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">An official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that Czech payer No 2 has not been stationed at an address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although they were VAT payers with a monthly tax period, they served the DAP for a quarterly tax year.</seg>
<seg id="208">In view of this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not assess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The realisation of the taxable supply between Slovak payer No 1 and Czech payer No 2 mentioned in the application in the amount of 16 575 thousand. Sk could not be verified due to the above facts.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel trade in order to draw an excess VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="211">B)</seg>
<seg id="212">Czech payer No 3, engaged in the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of the months 1 and 2/2005 in which he reported delivery of goods (workwear) to the Slovak payer No 4 with a total value of CZK 21,935,000.</seg>
<seg id="213">These working clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No 3 from Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax authority sent a request for information to the SR, which was mainly to verify whether Slovak payer No 4 had purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from Czech payer No 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="215">The reply to this request for information received from the SR showed that in DAP for month 12/2004 Slovak payer No 4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 stated the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the amount of only 1 193 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="216">The invitation to submit tax documents for the tax period of the months 10/2004 to 3/2005 did not respond to Slovak payer No 4.</seg>
<seg id="217">In the local investigation carried out in SR, it was found that the company was not at the address mentioned in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">The reply further stated that this payer fulfils all the characteristics of the so-called "lost society" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO of the SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out by the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated check, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or refute the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be measured against the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case is also being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="223">The course of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic with representatives of the SAO, took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">Participants in this meeting became aware of the VAT legislation in both states and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The result of the negotiations was a specification of the scope of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">The two parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: (a) verification of the validity and correctness of VAT officers registered in the Czech Republic or SR for intracomonality supplies; (b) verification of data on intracomonant acquisitions listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from recapital reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of SR payers contained in the VIES system; and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic on commercial transactions carried out.</seg>
<seg id="228">It was also agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be carried out following the volume of intracomonality deliveries between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of applications for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and Slovakia via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intracomonative transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The process of processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in intracomonial delivery and acquisition of goods illustrates the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intracomonant delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer makes an intracomonality delivery, he is obliged to file SH until the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic gives in SH summary information about the supplies of goods made by him to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The Slovak payer is obliged to indicate to SH the value of goods that have been exempt and delivered from the country to other EU Member States for the calendar quarter period.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the delivered goods are always shown in SH in the Czech or Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Data on services are not included in SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If a payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has given erroneous data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the event that the payer in the SR finds that the data referred to in SH were incomplete or incorrect, he shall lodge a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for the submission of SH, after that period he is required to submit an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">VIES allows the exchange of information on VAT registered users' registration data in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can check whether the VAT number of the relevant acquirer is registered in a given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">Data from the submitted SH are grouped on MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual VAT number of the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The aggregate value of all deliveries for each DIČ of the acquirer and the code of the method of performance from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, will be created.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from the L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intracomonality transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from L1QD files) is given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system in another Member State detects the erroneous TIN of the maker in the L1QD files sent, it generates the so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all the faulty VAT number indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is then sent to MF CLO, respectively DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous VAT number, VAT number is not registered in that state or has never been allocated, the customer with a particular VAT number was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, the VAT registration of the customer was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the wrong EU payer's VAT number is used in one of the SH or subsequent SHs sent lines, the so-called "Notice on the VAT ID" is generated at the relevant tax office by ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office will examine whether the delivery to the VAT registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the SR, DR CLO will process all O_MCTL messages in VIES and electronically send them to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of tax payers who have reported the wrong VAT number in their SHs.</seg>
<seg id="252">Tax authorities subsequently call on the payer to file an additional SH and give a valid VAT number, or the tax office, when reporting an invalid VAT number in the filed SH, will examine the delivery of the goods at the relevant payer.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of erroneous DIČs relating to intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Of the total number of 41,728 VAT number of Czech payers, listed in SH Slovak payers between the 2nd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, 929 were erroneous DIČs, i.e. 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number of 62 997 VAT number of Slovak payers listed in SH Czech payers in the same period, 416 were erroneous DIČ, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="257">When examining the activities of financial or tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">E.g.:</seg>
<seg id="259">- Although, when asked by the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in Q4 2004, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation revealed that the end of the marketing authorisation did not take place until 1 January 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO of the SR further found that 6 tax entities were submitted by SH, which reported the wrong VAT number, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain this VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the SR, the submitted SHs shall be transferred to the tax authorities in electronic form and the data from them shall be sent to DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">Following the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, DR CLO will send to the relevant tax authorities so-called breakdowns of errors in SH submitted by tax entities for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO of the SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH as of 26 July 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection procedure) and to 2.2.2006 (i.e. data processed after the end of the inspection procedure).</seg>
<seg id="265">The data comparison is provided in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="266">From the above data it can be seen that the audit of the SAO of the SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with the wrong VAT number (average by 199 SH per quarter), but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intracomonant supplies listed by the payer in the respective DAP lines is compared at the tax authorities with the intracomonality delivery value given by this payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">ADIS automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The overall difference between the values shown in SH and DAP was CZK 537,231,000 in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="272">Since the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values shown in SH and DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intracomonarian supplies according to SH as a match and set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intracomonality deliveries for one quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a not insignificant amount, therefore tax administrations should not set the compliance of SH and DAP in these cases without clarifying the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, the tax administrator without verification set the match in case of a difference of values in the amount of CZK 1,561,000.</seg>
<seg id="275">The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH was administered by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">For taxpayers with a monthly tax period at the time of DAP's submission for the first two months of the calendar quarter, tax administrators could not compare the intracomonal delivery values given in these DAPs with those according to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax administrators only became aware of any mismatch of the data in the DAP and SH when the tax liability or excess VAT deduction was assessed or refunded.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intracomonity acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intracomonality transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, data delivered from SHs delivered by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, the data are recalculated by the Czech National Bank's minimum and maximum daily exchange rates for the relevant period and are then compared to the acquisition value given by Czech payers in DAP for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the acquisition of goods recognised by the payer in DAP should be within the minimum and maximum recalculated value of L1QD (L1min and L1max values).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value shown in the DAP is less than L1min, the so-called verification order is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of authentication orders relating to the audited tax authorities in the Czech Republic is given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities in 33 cases did not examine irregularities in the values of intracomonality acquisitions to which the audited orders were pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="288">The overall difference between the values shown in SH payers from other EU Member States and DAP of Czech payers was at least CZK 148,319,000 in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, the Czech Republic has selected 533 files of tax entities for inspection, for which the audited tax authorities received a verification order from the I.F. CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The inspection identified the following most common causes of differences between the values given in the DAP of the acquirer and in SH of the supplier: on the side of the acquirer (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquirer did not indicate the acquisition of goods in regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in a different tax year than in which he was liable to declare the tax, in 6 cases the acquirer stated the value of the acquired goods in the incorrect line of DAP, on the part of the supplier (the EU payer) in 88 cases the payers from the EU in their SHI included the values of the services provided to the Czech payer, of which in 54 cases were the supplier from the SBCs, in 88 cases of the supplier in the Czech Republic, the supplier from the Czech Republic included the values of the services provided to the Czech payer in the Czech Republic, of which in 54 cases were the payers from the SR, included the supply of the goods in the SBCs in 88 cases of the supplier</seg>
<seg id="291">On the side of the payers from the SR, the value of the services provided in SH was most often incorrectly included.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were found at the audited tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 arose from the Slovak payer introducing the provision of services to SH for the first quarter of 2005 (construction work and delivery of goods, including assembly on the territory of the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of accepted advances into SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers gave in SH the advances received from Czech payers, resulting in a command to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to verify goods acquired are generated only once in one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where data from SHs are subsequently changed in EU Member States, such as a change in the customer of goods in the Czech Republic or the increased value of deliveries of goods to the Czech Republic, new authentication orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">As the VIES does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the locally competent tax authorities need not know the purchaser of the goods without any other complaint about the facts relevant for the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">An audit of the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer gave the value of the supply of goods to the Czech payer in SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 in the amount of 1 504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1 February 2005, the tax office sent a request for information to the locally competent Czech payer to the SR, as the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of the goods only in the amount of CZK 425,000.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of the tax proceedings, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 1 January 2005, correcting the data on the supply of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally listed Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the sum of 194 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers reported intracomonarian delivery to payers from the Czech Republic totalling 10,24 thousand Sk (i.e. CZK 8,183,000) in their SH for the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech buyers did not report intracomonarian acquisition in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, which was not mentioned in SH submitted by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the first quarter of 2005, Slovak payers in additional SHs related to the 2nd quarter of 2004 increased the value of intracomonant delivery for this Czech payer by a total of 10,24 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for the second quarter of 2004, even though the actual acquirer did not comply with the obligation to grant an intracomonality acquisition for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that, on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech taxpayer was additionally charged VAT for the tax period 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640 thousand and for the 3rd quarter of 2004 in the amount of CZK 3,305,000 from the goods acquired in these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">From the above, it can be seen that tax authorities had to examine in tax proceedings not only the differences caused by errors in the DAP of the purchaser, but also the differences caused by the different reporting of intracomonality and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">A unification of the conditions for reporting these data would lead to a streamlining of the control activity of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In the SR, APV DIS makes it possible to compare data on the value of goods acquired through the VIES system from other EU Member States with those listed in the DAP of Slovak buyers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which data is compared is called "Method MIN-MAX".</seg>
<seg id="313">This method will recalculate the value of deliveries of goods listed in SH payers from other EU Member States with a minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">There will be an MIN-MAX interval, which is used for comparison with the purchase values of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CLO will send the tax administrators information on the intracomonality acquisition values set out in the DAP and the values of the delivery from the EU in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator will decide for which VAT registered persons the difference will be examined, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of data provided by DR CLO, the SAO SR selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at audited tax offices, of which 25 were also purchased by goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="318">The SAO audit of the SR SAO confirmed the fact that the tax authorities did not consistently examine the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and did not check the accuracy of the data listed in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the SAO's audit at tax offices, 31 local investigations were terminated.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies, to which the VIES system showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States, the following facts were identified, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="322">In DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not disclose the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic accidentally listed this payer's VAT number in SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while it actually delivered the goods worth CZK 19,184,000 to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, the Slovak company was to purchase goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4th quarter of 2004 worth MIN 682 692 thousand. Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company submitted the DAP for the periods in which it stated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU only amounting to 480,599 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator conducted a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and DAP intracomonarian deliveries did not state according to the date of invoice issuance, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">In view of other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax administrator will request an examination of the value of the delivered goods through the SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">The acquisition of goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004 did not mention the Slovak payer in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11,286 thousand Sk and MAX 11 845 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office carried out a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax entity did not acquire any goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO SR recommended that the tax authority request to examine the delivery of goods from EU Member States via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">The VIES system reported delivery of goods to a Slovak customer worth MIN 557 thousand. Sk and MAX 565 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the DAP for the tax year 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not show any acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier from the Czech Republic on 10 December 2004 for the material consumed in repairing the hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO SR recommended carrying out a tax audit on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the audit of the SAO SR in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not terminate the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax audit on tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections will be filed by the tax authorities after they have been carried out by the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="340">These were, for example, the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak acquirer did not declare in DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004 the acquisition of goods from EU Member States and did not grant any tax for the tax period of the months 10 to 12/2004 and claimed a refund of the excess VAT deduction in the total amount of 1 236 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity had purchased goods worth 683 thousand euro (approx. 27,080 thousand Sk) from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="343">These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to customs in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Slovak customer payer in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for the amount of EUR 683 thousand, which he did not mention in the filed DAP.</seg>
<seg id="345">For the tax entity, the tax administrator carries out a tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for the 3rd quarter of 2004 to Q1 2005 and the delivery data reported by EU Member States in each quarter was a total of 4,800 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers from the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold these goods to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by the export uniform customs declarations.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not reported by the tax entity, according to the company's manager, the goods under the transit procedure were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records in respect of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">Tax control was initiated at the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International exchange of L3 Level Information</seg>
<seg id="353">The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by the locally competent tax authorities, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as the SPI) or spontaneous information (SPI) relating to a particular tax entity or transaction, by means of MF CLO or.</seg>
<seg id="354">DR CLO to another EU member country. The aim of the ŽOI is, for example, to prove the execution of a given transaction within intracomonality transactions, verification of a particular VAT number, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of the SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for replying to the ROI was set in Article 8 of this Regulation for 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which provides that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the RHI must relate to commercial transactions worth at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">Where the ROI relates to a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond in view of its workload.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure for processing received ŽOI by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of internal time limits set for processing at individual organizational levels, illustrates the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the SR, the deadline for the processing of ŽOI by the tax authorities was set internally for 2 months so that the three-month period under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 could be met.</seg>
<seg id="362">MF CLO received a total of 29 ŽOI and 3 SPI from SR from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 ŽOI received, 26 (i.e. 89.7%) were processed within the time limit of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were dealt with after that period.</seg>
<seg id="364">In the same period, DR CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 ŽOI received, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were processed within the deadline of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were dealt with after that period (for the other 2 cases, it was not possible to determine the processing time from the submitted materials).</seg>
<seg id="366">More detailed data on the time of processing of ŽOI received MF CLO or DR CLO contains the following chart.</seg>
<seg id="367">The reasons for sending the ŽOI, given on the SCAC forms, are provided in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT has been examined, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intracomonality transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="371">By examining the selected transactions, it was found that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries revealed cases of companies that carried out fictitious intracomonal commercial transactions to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not declare VAT on the received supplies of goods at the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the checks identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also highlighted the problems caused by different reporting of data on intracomonality deliveries and purchases of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">A unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activity of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="375">By examining the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system, it was found that the financial or tax authorities did not sufficiently use all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal permissions.</seg>
<seg id="376">Furthermore, it was found that the VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and the validity of the VAT registration of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH, processed before the start of the inspection performance, with data processed after the completion of the inspection performance.</seg>
<seg id="378">It was clear from the comparison of these data that the audit of the SAO of the SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with the erroneous VAT number, but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In the case of irregularities in the reported data of the SAO SR, it asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such an option under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The findings of the control actions obtained showed that the VIES system provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">As there continues to be scope for tax evasion in this area, there is a need for increased attention to intracomonality transactions in the VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="383">Communications</seg>
<seg id="384">This report was prepared in the Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the chairman of Najýššie's control department of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duty between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material gives an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Najk control úradom of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the management of value added and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the highest control authorities of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The subject of parallel control actions has been selected in view of the fact that indirect taxes account for a significant contribution to the revenues of the two countries' state budgets.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of value added tax, allowing the refund of excess deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High excise duty rates, especially for tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other European Union countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively across the European Union, the highest control institutions of the European Union Member States have been set up by the VAT Working Group, in whose activities the highest control offices of both countries are actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in a joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration in order to limit the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience gained and knowledge will be used in the framework of planned indirect tax inspections, mainly aimed at involving both Member States' tax administrations in the VIES system, to control the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the control of the management of value added tax and excise duties for the period 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Subject-matter of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise duty</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Control of the procedure of the tax administrator in the administration, control and recovery of value added tax and excise duty</seg>
<seg id="18">On 11.2.2004 the Cooperation Agreement was concluded in control activities between the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Najvyšší audit úradom of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO of the Slovak Republic"). The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implemented parallel control actions "Value added tax and excise duty tax", included in the auditing plan of the SAO for 2004 under No 04/07 and "Control of the procedure of the administration dane pri správe, control and recovery of dane from the pridé value and spotreb taxes", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR under No 18/2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the contract, the two parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from the files of tax entities held by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties were unable to obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the relevant state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic), the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial unions of southern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected Financial Offices: Financial Office for Prague 1, Financial Office for Prague 3, Financial Office in České Budějovice, Financial Office in Frýdek-Místek, Financial Office in Hodonín, Financial Office in Jihlava, Financial Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, Financial Office in Kroměříž, Financial Office in Písek, Financial Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, Financial Office in Velke Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SR") was carried out by the Section of Tax and Customs Administration of the SAO of the SR in cooperation with Exposituras of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">Tax Úrad Bratislava pre selected tax entities, Tax Úrad Bratislava III, Tax Úrad Trnava, Tax Úrad Pú-chov, Tax Úrad Banská Bystrica I, Tax Úrad Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Úrad Žilina I, Tax Úrad Žilina I, Tax Úrad Žilina II, Tax Úrad Košice I and Tax Úrad Košice IV.</seg>
<seg id="26">Objective of control</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the control actions was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of financial or tax authorities and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duty, with a focus on the collection of these taxes on the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the relevant financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Recapitulation of control results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. 2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">As part of the SAO's international cooperation, the SAO of the Slovak Republic handed over 22,206 items of uniform customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and vice versa, the SAO of the SR, handed over 30 221 JCD items from the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison of the drafted JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was made.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of the 5 883 selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 12,343 selected JCD items from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="36">Based on the unassigned JCD items, financial or tax offices selected files of tax entities for which reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak and financial or tax authorities, the implementation of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the territory of the second state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic carried out a joint pilot inspection at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, in which the two interested parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="39">The inspection did not identify deficiencies in the register of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both states and pointed to shortcomings in the import and export records.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="42">Control of the SAO and SAO SR in the field of international cooperation focused on imports and exports of spirits and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, and possibly other types of goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of an examination of the files of tax entities at selected financial or tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of the implementation of exports of goods declared at 40 JCD with a total statistical value of CZK 15,010,093 and the SAO SR to verify exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and the SAO of the SR found, among other things, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="45">- trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the SR customs database,</seg>
<seg id="46">- the error rate in entering data in customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- for some exports from the Czech Republic, corresponding imports into the Slovak Republic have not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="48">In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of unauthorising application of value added tax deductions,</seg>
<seg id="49">- Tax entities did not comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="50">- deficiencies were identified in the activities of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of value added tax and excise duties, attention will continue to need to be paid to international trade in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrators in the exercise of value added tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="53">The basis for effective control of excise duties is to check the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and the mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the state of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") was levied by financial or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out domestically and by customs authorities on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">Tax revenues for financial or tax authorities were determined by the difference between the collected own tax liability and the excess VAT deductions returned.</seg>
<seg id="58">The VAT revenues at the customs offices were due to the amount of tax collected by them.</seg>
<seg id="59">The tax collected by the customs authorities, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, was reflected in the tax deductions applied to financial or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most financial or tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the core taxes in terms of state budget revenues, as it accounted for around 31% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and approximately 42% in the tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="63">The financial and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions refunded totalled CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">Total VAT collection in the SR amounted to 83.8 billion Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tax and customs authorities collected CZK 187.0 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions refunded amounted to a total of EUR 103.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as the SpD) was made by the relevant financial or tax authorities and on imports of products subject to SpD by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="68">SpD's share of state budget tax revenues in the Czech Republic was approximately 16% in 2003 and around 19% in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total collection of SpD collected in the Czech Republic by the financial and customs authorities in 2003 was CZK 85.6 billion and in the SR amounted to CZK 38.0 billion.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. The course of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the SR took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out, in the second stage the results of this comparison were used in mutual verification of the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and in checks carried out on the territory of both states.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparing a control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and SpD inspections was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, inter alia, the selection of commodities - goods which represented a significant risk in complying with customs and tax legislation: - alcohol and spirits, tariff subheadings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff subheadings Nos.2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, items and subheadings of customs tariff Nos 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings Nos 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be made: (a) from the unassigned items found by the comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or in one lump sum, (c) on the basis of the findings from the checks carried out by selected tax and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. 4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002 tested a mechanism for the mutual allocation of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, some exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, with any alcohol content,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages;</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (whether or not cut off), cigarillos (cigarillos) and cigarettes from tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essences),</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmitting devices containing reception devices: For a cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmitting apparatus containing the receiving equipment: Other,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">JCD entries from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were assigned to each other on the basis of the agreement of individual JCD paragraphs (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration plate of the vehicle carrying cargo, date of crossing the national border, customs tariff item, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and charts.</seg>
<seg id="92">The mutual allocation of individual imports and exports was made more difficult, among other things, by the fact that commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD were declared on several import JCDs in the territory of the Slovak Republic, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that influenced the success of the assignment were the different composition of the data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the export records in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the financial or tax authorities audited.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was chosen for some tax entities that made imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, some tax entities were selected for the verification of business transactions reported in VAT returns, for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot control at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing for the performance of pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of the unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="100">On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of control sheets has been introduced at border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and Slovakia since 1.6.1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport carrying goods of a commercial nature in the customs area and to create the conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot inspection was carried out on 8.3.2004 to 26.3.2004 and was aimed at examining this customs control system.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of control certificates at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Consideration of the vehicle, issue of the inspection sheet and hand it over to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Shutdown of the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs discussions in the check-in hall check-in hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, Police of the Slovak Republic, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The execution of the check-in was confirmed by the individual components with a stamp on the checklist.</seg>
<seg id="108">3) Landing a vehicle into the area of carrying out a physical check.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the inspection sheet, JCD, or other documents to the customs officer - check the execution of all prescribed operations and documents.</seg>
<seg id="110">Performance of physical inspection by the relevant files.</seg>
<seg id="111">Removal of the vehicle from the customs area.</seg>
<seg id="112">Pozru: When goods were imported into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicles were carried out directly by the staff of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When goods were imported into the SR, weighing vehicles were carried out by staff of a designated legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">The vehicles were registered in computer records after consideration.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Control sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="117">The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Check sheets and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="120">When exported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the inspection certificates were issued and registered by the SR Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in the electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">Of the number of 453 JCD items, the SAO supervised 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO of the SR in cooperation with the workers of the Drietoma border crossing.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">When exported from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, the inspection certificates were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Out of a total of 339 JCD items of the selected SAO control sample in cooperation with the staff of the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov assigned to 295 JCD entries corresponding to the registration numbers of the control sheets.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by the workers of the border customs crossing of Drietoma and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The audit of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic did not detect deficiencies in the register of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified from the documents of customs administrations and financial and tax authorities on the territory of the other state.</seg>
<seg id="130">Selected tax entities have been verified:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCD was registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,</seg>
<seg id="132">- fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the VAT deduction on importation, the refund of excess VAT deduction and the application of the VAT exemption on export.</seg>
<seg id="133">The verification of commercial transactions was found to be:</seg>
<seg id="134">1. The SAO SR asked for verification of the implementation of alcohol exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="135">The SAO identified corresponding imports in the customs database of the Czech Republic in a statistical value of CZK 42,624.</seg>
<seg id="136">2. The company involved in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories applied an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in the VAT return for the month of December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="137">In order to control reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.</seg>
<seg id="138">The SAO of the SR identified 3 corresponding import JCD (17 items) in a statistical value of 1 724 321 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="139">VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="140">3. The company, whose business was mainly the trade in optical devices, applied a total excess VAT deduction in 2002 of CZK 4 1 36 000 higher than the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="141">To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected an export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.</seg>
<seg id="142">The SAO of the SR found that this JCD corresponds to the import JCD (12 headings) with a statistical value of 9 653 827 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="143">VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="144">4. The company engaged in, inter alia, buying goods for resale and sale, did not report any exports of goods in the submitted VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 totalled CZK 3,439,888.</seg>
<seg id="146">Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification with a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO of the SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) in a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="148">The audit of the SAO of the SR at the relevant tax office proved the implementation of the declared imports and the payment of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="149">5. The company whose business was, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and appliances, reported in 2002 the export of goods worth CZK 12,966,706 in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 the total value of exports was CZK 14,474,381.</seg>
<seg id="151">The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO identified SR 13 JCD (50 items) in the SR customs database with a statistical value of 3,621,370 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the SR customs database it was not possible to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCD (9 items) with a total statistical value of 399 776 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="154">The competent tax authority in the Slovak Republic verified these imports from the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer in the Slovak Republic, commented in the minutes of the local investigation that it had not implemented the imports declared on Czech export JCDs.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO of SR therefore asked the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the 2002 and 2003 tax.</seg>
<seg id="157">6. The company involved in importing and selling cigarettes exported tobacco stickers in a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 according to the Czech customs database in 2002 and a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="158">In the VAT tax returns, the company did not report any exports in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.</seg>
<seg id="160">To 4 export JCD (4 items) with a total statistical value of 2,246,860 CZK, the SAO identified SR 7 JCD (7 items) in the customs database SR 7 JCD (7 items) in the statistical value of 2,919,514 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="161">The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 could not be assigned adequate imports in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7. The software company did not report exports of goods in the VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630 198.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected for verification in SR 9 JCD (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the customs database of the SR SAO SR identified 8 JCD (8 items) in the statistical value of 915 601 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="166">The export JCD (1 entry) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 could not be attributed to the corresponding imports in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In these cases, it was not possible to identify in the SR customs database corresponding to imports to 6 JCDs with a statistical value of CZK 692,800.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- to 2 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the corresponding import JCD could not be identified in the SR customs database (see paragraphs 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error rate in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the "DIČ").</seg>
<seg id="171">It is therefore not possible to conclude with certainty that those exports did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="172">- for 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a statistical value of 399 776 CZK have not been demonstrated (see paragraph 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, suspicion of a fictitious export of goods for the purpose of unauthorised application of the VAT deduction is justified.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services as part of the control of selected financial or tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services, and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the files of the tax authorities were selected on the audited financial or tax authorities according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">2. from the registration of financial or tax authorities were selected tax entities according to the above: (a) applied VAT deductions on importation, (b) excess VAT deductions applied, (c) entitlement to a refund of SpD, (d) the VAT exemption claimed on export,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. tax entities for which tax control has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="180">Sampling was made regardless of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Check of the selected sample at the tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused mainly on the audited tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of the tax authorities in verifying the correctness of the declared VAT,</seg>
<seg id="186">- the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparing the data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax authorities with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparing the data on the JCD and the accompanying invoices with the particulars in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- Comparison of VAT return data on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at the tax authorities or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- how to verify the right to VAT exemption when exporting goods or services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT tax returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax authorities contained only records of those imports and exports for which tax entities were required to include imports or exports in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited tax authorities examined the files of the tax entities, which reported in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003 imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 and the corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the files of the tax entities reporting in tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 were checked with exports totalling CZK 47,323,111,000.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Czech Republic's customs database, tax entities for which imports and exports were examined between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, carried out imports into the Czech Republic from Slovakia in 2002 and 2003 with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT amounting to CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.</seg>
<seg id="195">The identified differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax authorities and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items that were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- for JCD items missing from the database of tax authorities, it has been verified that these are not cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items for which different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the tax authorities, the relevant JCDs were requested at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form, including the attached invoices.</seg>
<seg id="199">The screening revealed that the JCD database at the tax authorities did not include, for example, records of import JCDs with a total VAT value of CZK 3,622,000 and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Detected differences</seg>
<seg id="201">By comparing the JCD database at the tax authorities and the cumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for the selected sample of tax entities, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="202">Differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time shift between the realisation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT charged on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The taxpayer was entitled to deduct the tax on the importation of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax year during which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary admission procedure, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax period during which the scheme was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time difference between the realisation of exports and the moment when the taxpayer received JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The taxpayer was obliged to provide data on realized exports exempt from the obligation to apply output tax to the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods came out of the country if they simultaneously had a tax document, which was JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to comply with the obligations of tax entities when reporting imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax entities did not include correct data on imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT return filed, it has been made more difficult to control the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2.2. Synergies between the financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the audited period, following a decision by the customs authorities, import or export duties and VAT were refunded or remitted.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax entities were required by law to reduce the previously exercised right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office, in a tax return for the period in which the tax was returned.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the transmission of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with considerable delay and only from some customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the information necessary to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, customs authorities refunded VAT of more than EUR 319 million. CZK and in 2003 in the amount of over 398 mil. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the failure of certain obligations of VAT and SpD payers.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the administration of VAT and SpD, weaknesses were identified in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">(a) on the abolition of VAT registrations, the fulfilment of the obligation on payers to pay VAT on the registered assets, or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration in respect of which the payer applied the deduction, verified only rarely,</seg>
<seg id="221">(b) the tax authorities have not consistently used the possibility of carrying out a tax audit or local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">In this case, in some cases, there was a lack of verification of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">(c) the official records and reports on the oral hearing did not contain all the necessary data demonstrating the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied,</seg>
<seg id="224">(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports reported in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in SR</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Check of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample of the SAO SR, it verified or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the filed tax returns and refund requests from selected tax entities of the SAO SR, the tax office asked for the provision of the relevant JCDs documenting imports and exports, invoices and proofs of payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO of the Slovak Republic checked that the submitted JCD was registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of decisive facts and legal conditions when applying the deduction of input tax by way of importation, when the excess VAT deduction was refunded, the application of the exemption in respect of exports and the refund of SpD.</seg>
<seg id="230">In 10 audited tax offices, the SAO of the Slovak Republic verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic in the structure according to the respect of JCD items and the sum of the statistical values given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports were checked at a statistical value of CZK 856.2 million. Sk, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked at a total statistical value of 176 million. Sk, which from the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic represents 6.87%.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition, 618 cases of imports of additional goods and services (mainly white technology, packaging and software) from EU countries were checked into the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 532.8 million. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO OF THE SR's audit found discrepancies between the data registered in the SR customs database and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (natural persons) reported in tax returns imports of goods with a total value of 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the instigation of the SAO OF THE SR, tax entities were unable to prove to the tax authority the legitimacy of the application of input tax with the relevant documents on the implementation of imports and the payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- In the tax return for the January 2003 tax year, the taxpayer declared the taxable transaction received at the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and claimed an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">VAT returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of 59 161 535 Sk, which arose in January 2003, was not settled throughout 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above cases, the SAO SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excess VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s.r.o.) for the January to June 2002 tax year declared in VAT returns the export of goods with a total value of 87 199 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="242">By verification in the SR customs database, it was found that the taxpayer made exports at a statistical value of 296 747 Sk during that period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax office carried out a local investigation multiple times at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's managing director (UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the SAO's audit of the SR SAO, the tax administrator filed a complaint with the law enforcement authorities on suspicion of committing the crime of non-taxation.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO of the SR notes that the biggest problems in the performance of the administration and control of VAT and SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- non-use of the possibility of carrying out VAT control on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases of high value of excess VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="247">- the tax inspection protocols did not contain an inventory of the documents audited</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient screening of reported imports and exports of goods in tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy management of tax administrators in issuing decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, even as a result of the termination of the right to impose penalties;</seg>
<seg id="251">- non-compliance with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals;</seg>
<seg id="252">- non-compensation of VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excess VAT deduction,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">On the basis of the SAO's examination of the findings, the SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a VAT check with a focus on the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied for 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the identified deficiencies, the implementation of which will be monitored and monitored by the SAO of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both states and pointed to shortcomings in the import and export records.</seg>
<seg id="258">The results of the checks also identified persistent shortcomings in the fulfilment of VAT and SpD obligations, in the activities of financial or tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax authorities and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="259">The lessons learned also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Czech customs database within the tax information system. There is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT and SpD management was not the same, given the different rules and conditions in the territory of the two States.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available at the audited tax offices. The SAO of SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel VAT and SpD checks carried out assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period prior to joining the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will further deepen in the control of the activities of financial or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be made by all VAT payers who have made the supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are required to enter data from recapitulative statements into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) to which tax administrations from the Member States of the European Union have access.</seg>
<seg id="268">Financial or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare these data with the data contained in the filed VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is further used to verify the validity of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied on the supply of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outputs of upcoming control actions, which will, among other things, focus on examining the VIES system, which is intended to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-community supplies."</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budget revenues, control action needs to be focused primarily on monitoring and identifying risky areas in order to limit the scope for tax evasion to indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the inspection at asylum facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State property and funds earmarked for securing the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Audit Action No 04/23 "Property of the State and funds earmarked for securing the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior"</seg>
<seg id="4">Audit Action No 15/2004 "Control of pubs with the assets of the staff and financial prostheses intended for the provision of asylum and temporary attacking cudzincom in SR"</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the phenomena that has a global character and has become an inseparable part of the current development stage of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its cause is, in particular, the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last residency from persecution, in particular for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to gain asylum and integrate into society, especially in some of Europe's developed democratic countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">A large group is also made up of foreigners, whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The setting of concrete principles for aid to refugees has already been brought about by the adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the status of refugees, the acceptance of which the governments of the signatory countries have pledged to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to implement adopted international documents and confirmed their binding nature within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">The asylum process and related issues were targeted parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najýš Control Office of the Slovak Republic, the results of which are contained in a joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the highest control authorities of both countries was implemented on the basis of the "Contract of Cooperation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as the Treaty") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">The two Parties undertook to provide each other with information in the Treaty on the legislation governing the asylum procedure in the State of the other Contracting Party, selected statistical data on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to set out the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences of this for the area of population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooperation consisted in the harmonisation of the control action programme, the exchange of information to the extent provided for by the Treaty and the drawing up of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">The first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, set out the same headings of the audited issue and control procedures for the preparation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place on 28.6. to 30.6.2004, the common points for the control action programme were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the third joint meeting, which took place during the audit operation on 8.11. to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience from the ongoing inspections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of outputs from the checks were specified and the structure and content of the joint final report drawn up from 14.2. to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting were set out.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by auditors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial unions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited bodies were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MV") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, the defence section, vnútra and the staff of the úradov carried out a check.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migration Department of the Ministry of Slovakia (hereinafter referred to as "MÚ").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (the period checked).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data over a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of control results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. 2.1. Assessment of control activity</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of experience gained between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najýš Control Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange made it possible to evaluate the supporting documents submitted more thoroughly, to analyse the causes of the identified differences in the safeguarding of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">This made it possible to focus on the decisive problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ultimately, this positively affected the quality of carrying out the control activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents (EU) has been the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation governing this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU in order to further align with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a steadily growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">Within the meaning of international agreements, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="44">The state budget of both countries earmarks the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is influenced in particular by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until granting or not granting asylum, as well as the health of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in the asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="48">During the stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, catering, health care and basic material equipment and sanitary items.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, in the Czech Republic as well as integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one residential day depends on the occupancy and equipment of the Centre and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is projected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, whose growing number is expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on securing services. The decisive expenditure of this item was the expenditure on the accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated under the contract, the healthcare expenditure provided to asylum seekers and the costs of a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">A significant part of the total expenditure was also spent on salaries, payments for work carried out and premiums.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Current expenditure was a decisive factor in the execution of current expenditure on wages, salaries and premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of the state's property.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were shortcomings, in particular, in the area of the use of state budget funds in breach of the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act, when ordinary expenditure was covered by actions having the character of a technical appreciation of fixed tangible assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Accounting Act in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the accounting curriculum was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property when it was left to use another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act and leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorized for waste management was violated by the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas abstraction, shortcomings in public procurement and the management of state property when it was not sufficiently secured by its registration and the method of liquidation of unnecessary assets was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system has been secured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation in force governing the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some identified shortcomings, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and Najvyšší control úrad of the Slovak Republic, evaluate positively the procedure of SUZ and the Municipality in the provision of services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic note that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational units of both countries have managed tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the inspection were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the respective organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the audit be used in other joint control actions in the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Secondary New York Protocol of 1967).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and on Amendments to Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective in the Czech Republic since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended a total of five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be tied to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were in terms of binding political documents.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already in the context of the adoption of this law, there was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became part of Community law from 1.5. 1999 on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has created the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in appropriate legal binding nature.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the audit of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">After their implementation into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it carried out the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of the state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and the determination of the obligations of foreigners who applied for refugee status or who were granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1.1.1996 by the National Council of the Slovak Republic No 283/1995 Z. z., on the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Law No 480/2002 Z. z" on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Directive 2001/55/EC of the Council of Europe of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for granting temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of efforts between Member States in the adoption of these persons and the endure of the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to Act No 480/2002 Z., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course of the foundations of the Slovak language for the duration of their stay at the integration centre, the designation of a guardian by the courts of non-funded foreigners, if they are staying on the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances mentioned in the amendment to the Act.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU law on migration and the asylum process has been assessed in regular European Commission reports on the readiness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report highlighted the lack of staffing capacity of the Ministry of the Ministry, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum Process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters relating to refugees fall within the competence of the MV.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 January 1996, the MV has established an organisational unit of the state of SUZ. This was due to the state administration's exercise department in the field of asylum procedures, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the MoI, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to participants in asylum and asylum procedures for the MV.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, it performs decisive tasks in the area of the IHR's asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of foreigners' applications for asylum at level I of the administrative procedure and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it is preparing concepts for the state's migration policy.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the area of the creation of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have been significantly influenced by cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A special benefit was his financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR has also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The evolution of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and an increased number of refugees from Chechnya became apparent in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">A total of 394 asylum were granted in the audited period, 83 of them in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">In the audited period, no asylum was granted in a total of 22,731 cases and in 22,636 cases the asylum procedure was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties to 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been subject to a decision and those to whom the decision has not been referred.</seg>
<seg id="108">There are also included persons who have been waived to miss the time limit for lodging an appeal, or who have been annulled the previous decision and have not yet been issued a new one.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has a steadily growing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, it was already 10,358 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="111">A significant increase in the number of applicants occurred in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 people applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic in the audited period are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylum-seekers were granted in the audited period and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not awarded in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum procedure was discontinued in a total of 23,088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">The bulk of applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without permission, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002, it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants, and by more than 94% in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="118">The duration of one applicant's stay at one asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The findings of the Ministry also show that for most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic, it is about finding better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases, the asylum system is purposefully used by the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is no reason to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an application should be considered as manifestly unfounded under the provisions of Section 12 of Article 12(a) of Act No 480/2002 Z.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognised principles for the identification of economic migrants are not yet established to distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and that would allow the asylum process to be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is, in terms of international migration, transit countries and destination countries have been and remain Western European states.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple purpose applications for asylum in several EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants are returning to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may in the following period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create the conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until the decision to grant or not grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Drawing of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged, within the meaning of international agreements and the national legislative arrangements based on them, to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budget of both countries earmarks the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on the granting of asylum, as well as their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher use of statutory benefits for applicants such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, in the audited period, there was a meal allowance of CZK 58 per person per day, an allowance of CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child under the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per residential day was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to pocket money, asylum seekers staying in residential centres with separate cooking and applicants staying in private outside asylum facilities may receive a contribution up to the minimum subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, admits, among other things, in § 84 municipalities, to a contribution to the reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility on its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period amounted to CZK 7 per person per stay day.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil in the audited period and a month, provided that in a given month the person attended the school for a minimum of 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period, there was a meal allowance of 70 Sk per person per day, pocket money 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per residing day was on average 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">The municipalities on whose territory the asylum facility is located is granted, in accordance with Law No 480/2002 Z. z., on asylum, a partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of an asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">So far, municipalities have only partially benefited from the possibility of applying for a contribution, which is set at 1 500 Sk per bed and calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries for issuing a decision on asylum sets a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure and at the same time allows for an extension of this deadline in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the amount of state budget expenditure, is the submission of remedies against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was made between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the application for asylum (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to MÚ data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the statutory possibility of extending the time limit by filing an appeal to the court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and at the time of the audit, the proceedings were not closed in court.</seg>
<seg id="154">Some contribution to the shortening of the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint workplaces of the Municipality and Úrad Border and cudzineckej polície Policajný zboru in the reception centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and in Liptovské Vlachoch, which was approached at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This envisages simplifying procedures and shortening procedural deadlines between the two components of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum devices</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to the participants in the asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="158">During the stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket money and basic material equipment and sanitary items during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum equipment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible to manage the state's property in the premises of the Vyšní Lhoty reception centre, the reception and residential centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kashava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Section 80 (3) of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1,977 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Admission centres are closed establishments which may not be allowed to leave asylum seekers until the prescribed medical examinations and basic admissions listed in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violations of the obligation to stay at the reception centre are assessed as a misdemeanor.</seg>
<seg id="167">The residency centres to which asylum seekers from reception centres come are used to house asylum seekers until the decision on their application for asylum or not to grant asylum becomes final.</seg>
<seg id="168">Subject to certain conditions, asylum seekers have the opportunity to leave or stay in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Applicants for asylum, in reception and residential centres in which they are reported to reside, have the right to free accommodation, the provision of meals, other services and pocket money, provided that they have tolerated the acts necessary to ascertain their financial and property circumstances, and those circumstances are such that even partial reimbursement of those services cannot be fairly claimed from them.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for temporary accommodation for persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the resort on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of an extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or they will secure it themselves as part of the state integration program.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with the recognised status of a refugee have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">To compare asylum facilities, he was chosen as the best-sensifying indicator of the cost of one physical residential day.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of persons to whom the services provided by the asylum facility were actually provided every day.</seg>
<seg id="177">Table 3 and in the graph are devices operated by SUZ designated as own and facilities operated by legal persons on the basis of Section 80 of Act No.325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one residential day in its own asylum facility operated by SUZ decreases with increasing fulfilment of these facilities. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of running the premises are budgeted for more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The volume of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers increases proportionately with their increasing numbers.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis capacity were accommodated in their own asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, emergency accommodation capacity in residential containers, caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers from Chechen nationality from Poland, even used extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (a total of 320 beds).</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was secured by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">Spending per applicant per day of residence was then lower in those years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, long-term maintenance of the high filling of these devices is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">Account should be taken of the risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated requirement for the need for higher accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum facilities operated contractually allows, where necessary, the adoption of operational solutions in the area of the capacity of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Municipality has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residential centre Brezová pod Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 seats and the residential centre is 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">The growing number of asylum seekers was dealt with by the Municipality by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava with a flexible disposable capacity from 250 to 940 seats.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the contract concluded, the leaseholder also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the Ministry dealt with the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in leased premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Admission centres had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% in the audited period, with an average of 33% to 50% in residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="197">Occupancy changed according to the season and the highest was in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 seats will be possible after the reconstruction of the resorts in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">Following the completion of the Humennom Centre in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the cost of running asylum facilities are shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body providing premises and ensuring the operation of the facility, including the related activities, is one of the options to ensure, at reasonable costs, the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of funds and state property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Economic analysis</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, in 2001, approved budgeted SUZ expenditure was increased by 13 budget measures by CZK 103,077,000.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of this, 89,979 thousand CZK (87.29%) were purpose-designed funds. The bulk of it was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538,000) and the provision of health care provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870,000).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, SUZ spending was increased by 20 budget measures by CZK 88,362,000.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of this, CZK 62,282,000 (70.48%) were earmarked funds, the bulk of which (CZK 23,200,000) was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, SUZ spending was increased by fourteen budget measures by a total of CZK 88,078,000.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of this, 82,000 thousand CZK (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 to address the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000,000 for a program of humanitarian evacuations of disabled residents of the Iraqi Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the drawdown of selected SUZ expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the above overview that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on providing services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenses spent on the purchase of services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The outrageous expenditure under this item was the costs of accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, medical treatment expenses provided to asylum seekers and the costs of a permanent security service providing security in individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">A significant contribution to SUZ's total expenditure was spent on salaries, payments for work and premiums (23.99% - 24.97%).</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, total SUZ expenditure was significantly accounted for by material purchases (around 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest share of these expenditures (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the MÚ's budgetary economy to secure migration policy and the asylum process has been marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular, in 2001 and 2002, the draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part were characterised by an imbalance between the requirements of the Ministry, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs for their legal claims, and the resources provided mainly in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter disproportion dealt with several budgetary measures over the course of the year, increasing the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and up to 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the drawdown of selected MÚ expenditure in the audited period is shown in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">The implementation of current expenditure was a decisive factor in spending on wages, salaries and premiums ranging from 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% were spending on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% on food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another significant part was spending on accommodation and catering services by a share of 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">The relatively low share in the range from 1.03% to 6.25% was capital expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Shortcomings identified</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and property.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were shortcomings in particular in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget funds in violation of the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act when ordinary expenditure was covered by actions having the character of a technical appreciation of fixed tangible assets; (b) a violation of the Accounting Act in the field of inventories and in non-compliance with the exchange chart.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property, when it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to land registry data violated the Land Registry Act; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorized to manage waste was violated by the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="230">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas abstraction, shortcomings in public procurement and the management of state property when it was not sufficiently secured by its registration and the method of liquidation of unnecessary assets was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, an internal control system was introduced for SUZ on 1.7.2002, within the meaning of the provisions of Act No. 320/2001 Coll., on Financial Control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, ongoing and subsequent control.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal SUZ auditor was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year, SUZ is issued a plan of financial, socially and operationally technical inspections aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">In 2002, 42 management checks were carried out and 54 were carried out in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations, the Úrad ensures the Minister's checks.</seg>
<seg id="237">The audited period did not check the performance of tasks in the asylum policy section.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system of the MÚ is focused primarily on the implementation of preliminary and ongoing financial control under Act No 502/2001 Z. z., on financial control and vnútornom audite.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of the financial control is also regulated by the internal regulations of the Director of the Ministry of Industry.</seg>
<seg id="240">The substantive focus of the control activity as part of the management of individual departments was established within the framework of the annual plan of the Ministry of Industry.</seg>
<seg id="241">Responsible for the exercise of control in this area were identified by trade union directors.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the written documentation submitted, deficiencies were not identified.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the Regulation of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic No 28 of 23.4.2004, the Ministry of the Ministry of the Slovak Republic has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.</seg>
<seg id="244">In the near term, the organisational security of this task will need to be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="245">Communications</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel expenditure controls on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be difficult to imagine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and costs is an important task for the state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a very demanding task both in organizational and technical terms and financially.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts at sustainable mobility often and hard to find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction of transport infrastructure, also thanks to the necessary measures in favour of the environment, are financially challenging.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considerated procedures and decisions of the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings from public financial resources that can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the roles of the audit institutions is to actively seek out shortcomings that have led to less than achievable cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit institutions should not only alert the state administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures that lead to an improvement in the situation, for the benefit of the citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">The two highest audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as Germany and the Czech Republic) were carried out by the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) in 2005 and 2006 parallel inspections of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (distance D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The highways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough check on the efficiency of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the basis of close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the amount of German bridge and tunnel costs for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction process, the completion date was eventually scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the award of the contract, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the RMD) made mistakes that led to an extension of the duration of the competition and the reduction of the construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint inspection work, the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 were compared on the basis of the conversion into m2 of the bridge structure area.</seg>
<seg id="24">The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per m2 area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and the SAO now have a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels, on which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, both control institutions recommend: standardization of bridge structures and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the main hallmarks of the collaboration was her team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel control, the auditors were involved in their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report reports on the progress and results of parallel checks on funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The checks focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel checks were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) for the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the figure 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million from European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to the parallel control carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH controlled the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to around €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – central and southern parts of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">Highway A 17 runs from the state border of the Czech Republic/Germany to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, border sections of both motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is completed all the way to Dresden, while it is not finished on the Czech side of the D 8 motorway, because the section no. 0805 of 16.4 km through the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section No 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, there should be an operating intensity of 22,940 vehicles per day in 2008 on the border section No 0807 of the D 8 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the inspection of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel checks carried out by the two inspection institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">BRH and SAO cooperation</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two highest audit institutions have discussed close cooperation in controlling the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">The two sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction rests with the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out a check of this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to ensure the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of the journey on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions were signed on 4 January 2006 by the Coordinated Control Agreement on the D 8/A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="64">The joint working meetings of the BRH and SAO inspectors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">Current problems and tasks were addressed at the meetings, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for checking the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the control of the border bridge construction and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">An important sign of cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and tender procedures, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal rules for government control differ in both countries in the way control actions are closed.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two highest audit institutions drew their own control conclusions on their findings, obtained during their inspections.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved in parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will be completed by signing the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a date for the completion of the construction of the border bridge, as far as possible, in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two sides then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD was active as an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany is financially involved in the construction of the bridge from 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed to a coupled steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">That decision was justified by a reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent environmental benefits of such a solution to the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, the comparative calculations carried out by the RMD stated that the coupled steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">They stated that the new coupled steel-conconcrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it's 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It has not prepared a custom dossier that adequately describes the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for comparing tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the evaluation and evaluation of tenders and the Director-General evaluating the bids in a subjective and problematic manner.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful tenderer challenged the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition resulted in the contract for the award of the construction contract being signed later than originally envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after evaluating the bids, was wasted and the construction time was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The offered procedure included a double assembly of the bridge superstructure, a change in the structure of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of the assembly space.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was unable to procure the originally designed type of steel within the necessary time.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a higher price by about €4 million, which had to be fully paid by the RMD – allowed for a reduction in the time to perform anti-corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to reduce the overall construction time of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in funding.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced time earmarked for construction work has led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Currently, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">The two highest control institutions carried out an analysis of the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the check, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two highest control institutions set the following principles for comparison of bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to change); disregard prices for special bridge foundations; rewrite prices in CZK at the rate of the European Central Bank valid as at 30 December 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On both D 8 and A 17, there are bridges of various structures (steelo-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In an effort to ensure the homogeneity of the structures studied, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of structure.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border were concrete bridges (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused primarily on this group of bridges, as the number of the set allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">Checks found that prices per m 2 concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see charts below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">A method was used to locate these bridges to detect atypical values in a set of numbers and a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (for the determination of atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve upwards was used).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should only be seen as an indicator on which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the reasons for the high price should be analysed in each identified case.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">In view of the fact that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The lower prices of Czech concrete bridges are also supported by lower labour costs in the construction sector in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on the D 8 are higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the competition for the contract.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">There is greater variability in bridge structures in the Czech Republic than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge structure was decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision shall be taken at the time when the RMD is submitting an application for a zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">The RMD at this time selects types of bridges from multiple variants, but cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel-concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of the tunnels on the D 8 were twice as high as the tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">Comparing the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with the tunnels in Germany, however, showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generally applicable conclusions to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden motorway – Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the concept of developing the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be taken before the border section no. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic is acquiring the D 8 motorway as part of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In programme No 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/SRN" set two targets for the construction of the D 8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin-Istanbul - international target.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the program, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists challenged that decision with legal actions.</seg>
<seg id="151">The actions are not finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">It cannot therefore be excluded that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed a few years later than stated in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of section No 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve a national goal – improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD made an estimate of capital expenditure for the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 via the Czech Central Mountains in 1999-2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate for this capital expenditure of the included investment costs is about €639 million combined for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Economic assessment results (EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections excluding VAT, calculated as at 31 December 2005, was € 897 million, or 27,4 % higher than the cost level with which the 2001 economic analysis worked.</seg>
<seg id="168">But there is a risk that section 0805 will be conducted in a different, more costly route, which would affect the aforementioned line of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of itineraries for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains envisages an intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="171">With a higher load of itineraries for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenues and cost increases means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 was not to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">Also in the construction of the A 17 motorway, there was a similar cost overrucy as in the case of these two sections on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the federal road development plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany envisaged a cost of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost-to-income ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have soared to about €670 million, and the cost-benefit ratio has more than halved.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to the parallel control carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, BRH found that the competent approval state authority had requested an off-road tunnel for Section A-17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the inspection, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">The result was savings, which amounted to roughly €10 million and €0.15 million in annual operating costs alone.</seg>
<seg id="182">When assessing the first Section A 17 BRH, BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not investigate the conditions of the bedrock in the rocks of Dölzschen because the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine hit a rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks inside were more weathered than anticipated during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injection and protective net against stone falling had to be taken, which required about €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Roads and Motorways Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as security measures in the rocks of Dölzschen, but also for measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes the costs associated with the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), further training of drilling workers (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods as a result of exceeding the duration of the project (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">Following the lessons learned from these and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter management in its oversight of road construction work.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Federal Ministry should give the Road and Motorway Directorate the necessary incentive to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and course of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">The two highest control institutions have built a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels, on which future controls will be able to rely.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.</seg>
<seg id="197">The inspectors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use for further inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects carried out under the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The emerging community of the people of Europe is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let this community give the opening statement on this joint report by the two highest control institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often remnants of darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, and to further facilitate the development of the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover coastal areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most of the programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last for seven years and a total of EUR 5.7 billion is earmarked for them from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The programmes include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling trails and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or the development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, advice on employment issues, the creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The funds shall be provided on condition that the project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characteristics: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint funding."</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the framework of the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, funding and control of the activities of the project are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: joint choice of management partner, joint project preparation and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assuming overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, the overall support payments are accepted by the lead partner and carry out their transfer to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out on the territory of the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS ČR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">The implementation of the operational programme was allocated €258,187,467.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total sum included a contribution from European funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be exhausted by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the use of EU funds from the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation The Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 is presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement on cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27 February 2013 following previous mutual negotiations at the meetings of the heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, held in Lovasberény, Hungary, in September 2012.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to examine whether the implementation of the operational programme is carried out in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system operates reliably, whether the objectives of the operational programme are being achieved and that the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the support provided.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel check, in which the control authorities, on the basis of their statutory mandate, independently examined topics the content of which had been jointly discussed in advance.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The inspection carried out also contained elements of a performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">Selected topics were examined on a sample of projects for project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The results of the checks carried out were the audit findings published in the usual manner by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the basis of the two control conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report was drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="32">The joint control sample selected included six projects (Annex 1) which fall within the area of aid 1.1 - Strengthening transport accessibility and support area 2.2 - Promoting the development of tourism.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the absorption of funds from these two areas of support accounted for more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 for all projects carried out throughout the OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to controlling a joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and NIK two others (all in the area of support 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to the beneficiaries of the ERDF aid, which were audited by the SAO and the NIK, totalled EUR 25 362 174 (SAO) and EUR 8 450 784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited volume of appropriations represented 41 % of all funds paid to beneficiaries of aid from aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both inspections independently carried out by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of significance.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of the OPPS ČR-POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited persons who were part of the management and control system have taken steps to limit the risk of misuse of funds and the non-use of ERDF funds provided.</seg>
<seg id="42">Evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is a high level of achievement of the objectives set, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the societal evaluation of project implementation.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF CONTROLS</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of the control and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out a check of the management and control system of the OPPS ČR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the National Coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development POL) and Controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodeship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in connection with the setting and performance of the function of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in the context of setting the objectives of the programme and monitoring of the progress achieved, evaluation activities and annual reports, assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the absorption of the programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, as well as the control activities of the managing authority, setting up the performance of activities and outputs from audits of the entrusted audit entity and with the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance, at the same time, the coordination of tasks and cooperation between the institutions involved in the CRL.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the drawing up of project implementation control plans were examined and the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The examination of the control system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot checks, which allowed the approval of, for example, the supply of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, while the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with EU national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant deficiencies were identified by the SAO's audit in the area of publication of correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, the risk of non-transparency of this process has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other deficiencies were identified in the area of setting up monitoring indicators and setting up the irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and control system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities identified by the NEV relating to the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of existing laws and rules have not been assessed as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These discrepancies had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified discrepancies, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit did not show a contradiction between the indicators and the objectives set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">The expected results were achieved in all projects audited, the funded activities were carried out and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the societal evaluation of the implementation of the projects described below in the text.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect that the SAO and the NIK have paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the fulfilment of the projected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time the objectives of the whole operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, a poll conducted in the summer of 2013 at the site of the implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to a part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to a part of the project carried out in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey mainly concerned the appropriateness, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and the societal function of projects, including investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents for individual projects is given in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the responses from the survey indicated that the overall societal evaluation of the projects was good and reached 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), meaning that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both with regard to the objectives and other parameters mentioned in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and restoring contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level of the expected respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of participants in panel discussions (target groups) carried out under the NIK control on the Polish side, who pointed to the need for project implementation and confirmed their positive public acceptance and the fulfilment of expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of the legality of the projects audited</seg>
<seg id="74">For the beneficiaries of the aid, the compliance of the project with the timetable and content of the project application was examined, the fulfilment of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in projects, the handling of any project revenue, the fulfilment of the obligation of separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the ban on the financing of projects from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, the fulfilment of mandatory publicity concerning in particular the dissemination of awareness of the sources of financing of projects from the EU, compliance with the eligibility conditions of project expenditure, the collection of suppliers and the verification of deliverables on the basis of public contracts awarded.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of shortcomings by qualified SAO and NIK as ineligible for EU funding was estimated at €85 094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the specified level of materiality relating to the total controlled volume of appropriations for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the discrepancies found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively by the beneficiaries of the aid.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the commitments resulting from the conditions of the aid were duly fulfilled by the beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds earmarked for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU and national law regulations.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nevertheless, seven of the eight beneficiaries audited by NEVs were found to have irregularities in the implementation of in-kind and financial obligations.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of non-systemic nature and concerned, in particular, inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breach of public procurement rules, which did not have an impact on the choice of supplier or the supply of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">Only in one of all NIK-controlled projects can the irregularity found, relating to non-compliance with reporting obligations, be assessed as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which €8,231 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2 098 053 in three of the 19 audited projects (of which €76,863 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included non-delivery of paid material and work or expenditure for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who had no link to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system in particular with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, efforts must also be made to identify such indicators at both programme and project level, which will allow for a more reliable verification of the implementation of the identified impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Notes and recommendations resulting from the checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate control conclusions of the SAO and the NIK on CDs.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICATION</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was prepared in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the Presidents of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Procurement of public works contracts and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint Parallel Control Report by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private spheres.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the Single Economic Area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its rules, the EU has set limits whereby the contracting authority must comply with certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unlimited competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public procurement that are values below EU limits, regulation of their procurement remains within the remit of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with the consequent high potential for damage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and incorrect favouritism (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel checks on procurement procedures and the prevention of corruption in land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The checks included procurement below European limits in order to penalise the area of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report, which is addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Control areas and audited institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH assessment is based on blanket checks of the aforementioned areas carried out on German building administrations responsible for federal transport and land constructions between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, highway construction and large-scale building projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO evaluation is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the award of federal public contracts is mostly carried out by the provincial construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the area of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of state institutions for road and railway construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of building construction, public procurement is carried out by beneficiaries of budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at the various stages of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation must take into account differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and subordinate standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts .</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called federal government tender manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the area of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation relating to contracts with value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The terms of reference were made to substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up room for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and narrower procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national regulations (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedure), but these are virtually identical to the above conditions for the European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates on a European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and when calling for competition, any bidder may submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved primarily by splitting the overall public contract into commercially specific parts and dividing into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">The award of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the proceedings as many candidates as possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested instruments for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Germany, more than 330,000 construction companies are registered with 1.9 million employees.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must be applied even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is a simplified sub-prime procedure where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between open management and closer management.</seg>
<seg id="49">85,000 construction companies are registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total number of contracting authorities for public works and share of individual types of procedure in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction work in Germany amounted to 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of which CZK 1,138 billion (15%) was the share of public contracts, which, in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of the federal road and earthworks (without the construction of railways and water constructions) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal contracts for land works and transport works was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public calls; 12.7% closer management and narrower calls;</seg>
<seg id="55">6.6% of the negotiated procedure and direct procurement; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic in 2011 reached CZK 118.6 billion , which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, it reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedure; 14.3% narrower procedure; 9.5% negotiated procedure; 8.4% simplified procedures for sub-prime contracts; 2.7% other procedures.</seg>
<seg id="59">The figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries have been targeted at a substantial part of public procurement procedures; the prevention of corruption, which must still be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open relevance. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel controls on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The checks focused on comparing the legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">The key findings are also provided:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national rights of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but of the national procurement rules of the two countries, which differ in part in terms of focus and in detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the essential requirement to comply with the tender documents is the inclusion of all the information needed to prepare tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, a division of contracts is required into parts where it is only possible in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO's inspections showed that significant heavy public works in the field of road construction are commissioned in the Czech Republic without being divided into parts or divided into parts, but only into a very significant volume. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and give rise to the risk of non-serious price negotiations and inadmissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to retrospectively outsource further works if this need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for the correct determination of the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, under the applicable regulations, contracting entities can freely designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a narrower procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">German regulations in tendering and budgetary law enshrine the primacy of open procedures for both European tenders and national ones, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of bidders to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption because they make it difficult to negotiate prices illegally between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results in value for money are achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts whose projected total price is or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting entities have always tendered a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">In determining the type of procurement procedure, the correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which the values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is an objective enough tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a works contract according to European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish preliminary information and notice of the initiation of a procurement procedure, in order to strengthen competition by allowing interested parties to prepare in a timely manner for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">When selecting candidates to participate in a narrower procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Beyond EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, rotate candidates who call for participation in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to prevent the risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (point 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting entities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between those candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must, as far as possible, be prevented in order to avoid restricting competition in the form of unlawful agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited German contracting entities did not meet the requirement in several cases (paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">The labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of bids is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more complex, but it has not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities forwarded their bids to third parties for consultation without their prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">Participants must be concerned about the intended award of the contract for legal protection enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The procurement procedure documentation was not always complete or entirely credible for the audited contracting entities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level have not always been properly complied with in the minutes of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some identified deficiencies reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the guiding principles of European procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">European Award law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts in order to ensure the free movement of goods and services and the Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (Right Procedures Directive), the two Directives being transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The EU's general procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include the Directive on the Coordination of Public Procurement Procedures, in addition, includes provisions relating to construction projects with a total estimated value of more than €5 million.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the content of the procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the end of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most appropriate tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of candidates is governed by the Review Procedures Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of contract law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Importance of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="126">In none of the two countries, there is no legal definition of what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is seen as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such misuse is encouraged by those who benefit.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be a barrier to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the total damage related to corruption amounts to 5% of the world's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved, conventions restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may weaken confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, the prevention of corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Both practice and procedures must be controlled, in particular, in areas particularly susceptible to corruption, in order to take adequate measures to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Adopting preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be particularly susceptible to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures on the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which mainly concerns active and passive bribery, acceptance and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in federal administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process beyond risk analysis: priority of open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">Moreover, other measures having preventive influence against corruption have become part of the right to tender.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor the procurement of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed in order to identify any irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is being prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="144">The statutory requirement for transparency, equal treatment and prohibition of any discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were established by the government in the "Government Strategy to Fight Corruption for the period 2011 to 2012" which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of these measures were incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and the follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the limits for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notice by the contracting authority, including the justification of the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in a narrower procedure and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts including annexes; the obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of checks relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documentation</seg>
<seg id="150">The tender documents must contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their bids in due form.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documentation must allow the bidding price to be processed.</seg>
<seg id="152">For this to be possible, candidates must not be exposed to risks they could not count on.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents contain, in particular, specifications, as well as the requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must limit competition to the least extent possible and all candidates must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">The specification shall be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, the documentation should avoid confusion or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that the specifications are generally stated without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specifications shall specify the required supplies and services and detail the number of units of work and supply.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be quoted according to works or supply units (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Defining the required work in terms of their functionality is only permissible in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that the specifications need to be developed in full and unambiguous way.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain exact quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="170">Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or according to time worked must be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the tender documents must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must allow each tenderer to prepare their offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender must only be made public when the tender documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for subpoena to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">A contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts if the nature of the subject-matter of such a contract so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule is required to divide construction work into parts, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific aspects (specialised part of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows participation in competition to small and medium-sized entities, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of input is usually considered to be the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, the tender documents must include evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the tenderer comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria by which its tender will be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European calls for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion from it of any information that would help identify specific interested firms, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining any additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the satisfaction of the contracting authority through contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish tender documents and allow them to be accessed for vetting.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only contact point for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional work or modification of existing works after the conclusion of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries allows a multi-works contract to be awarded to the same contractor within a certain limit, without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, additional work must be necessary and must be in the nature of a specific component of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied to award additional works.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may risk a greater time delay in the execution of the contract and the possible integration of the new entity into the project already running.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where a multi-works contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multi-works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to extra work, there may be less work during construction, i.e. works that were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, less work and extra work cannot be compensated for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have been replaced in the meantime by EU standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications contained data requiring a trade mark, e.g. for a system of resilience of public inscriptions, for preventing water penetration or for noise-cancelling, although this was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications broken down into items</seg>
<seg id="206">Even in a single case of scrutiny of procurement procedures, the BRH did not record non-compliance with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services according to the quantitative specifications divided into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, the tender documents were fully drawn up before the call for tenders was announced.</seg>
<seg id="209">However, in various cases, documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the items or timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, it contained the tender documents for the work and supplies, the need for which was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Contract splitting and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for not dividing deliveries into parts has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">For the evaluation criteria for tenders prior to the award of the contract, BRH found no shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="215">Include the names of authorised independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many of the documents featured interested authorized experts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Names were listed on the opening pages of documents or on plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact the explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">For building projects, these cases were found mainly in the case of tender documents, where self-employed professionals were responsible for processing the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities said they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to scrutinize the tender documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house of 12 flats, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products nor justified why it required the delivery of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of a college facility, the tender documents included references to specific trading firms and specific product labels.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overview of specifications and sub-species</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documents the quantity and type of required works, supplies or services in the statement of assessment and set only the enclosed space in cubic metres for each building as a specific unit.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the ring road, the tender documents for the narrower procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation triggered by an extension of the scope of the contract and a change in the technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the construction of social objects, the tender documentation had defects that forced the creation of additional works (there was no precise focus, a sufficient construction-technical survey was not carried out, drawings were missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">The tender documentation for the construction of a large library featured interior elements only in descriptive terms, without specifying the qualitative requirements for products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The delivery of the interior furnishings of the building was provided by subcontractors, who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for awarding the contract</seg>
<seg id="235">There is no obligation to award a contract in parts in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="236">An analysis of three large road constructions carried out in the construction of the ring road showed that when they were commissioned in open driving in parts (after each other after selected buildings), savings of up to 790 million could be achieved. CZK from the achieved public procurement price 15,508 mil. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, when awarding six building objects as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 62.5 million could be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">CZK, i.e. 25% of the contracted price and when awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 287.8 million could be achieved. CZK, i.e. also 25%.</seg>
<seg id="239">The contracting authority, when constructing roads in the tender documents, laid down qualification criteria that limited the participation of small contractors in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the tender conditions of the open procedure for the contractor for one construction of the motorway construction, the contracting authority requested, among other things, the contractor's practice of implementing at least three road constructions with a financial volume of more than EUR 700 million each. CZK, completed or operational over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing buildings over CZK 700 million. CZK in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of another highway construction in an open procedure included six separate works for which the contracting authority had requested a minimum annual volume of construction work in the last three years of EUR 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or either individually in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of 13.2 billion CZK, there were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential could lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Area of multi-works</seg>
<seg id="247">In the construction of the ring road, the contracting authority did not enter into a written contract for the supply of additional works of construction in two cases, and the extra work did not enter into any of the procedures set out in the Act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of pre-approved additional works in one case was EUR 1 591.4 million. CZK without VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the second case 4 135.8 mil. CZK without VAT (increase of 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The reason for the extra work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">For the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies, the necessity of which it was already aware of when awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and deliveries, he concluded amendments to the contract for the work with the contractor of the construction with an increase in the price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the Justice Palace, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices of additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than the comparable works carried out by the same supplier.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic are 355.0 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre section of the four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions on tender documents are almost identical in both countries and are in line with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow interested parties to calculate the costs and prepare their bids.</seg>
<seg id="263">In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to outsource additional work.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by other rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and carrying out manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, there is higher transparency achieved by publishing award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries, specification requirements are mostly met.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases, deficiencies have been identified which could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">At the same time, the rule in Germany requiring the division of bulky construction projects into parts seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without partial procurement or division into large parts can limit the circle of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">The strict requirement for references of bidders, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of bidders for road construction work, is the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small circle of bidders, and small and medium-sized companies thus have no chance of competing.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of applicants also increases the risk of fixing prices and other illegal conventions.</seg>
<seg id="272">As regards the award of additional contracts for additional work or modified work and their reimbursement, regulatory approaches are different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, additional works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20%.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the 20 % limit is exceeded, additional work must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing the work into parts, it is possible to avoid restricting competition as well as the subsequent dire consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Identification of the type of procurement procedure with respect to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the circle of potential contractors who will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">A procuring entity may keep the range of potential suppliers unlimited or may limit the range according to the criteria entered.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of major project work whose value is or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In particular, when choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million (€125 million). CZK), it is always required to issue an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="288">If a construction project reaches an EU limit, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by issuing a national procedure where the total value of the relevant part is below €1.0 million (€25 million). CZK) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimate of the entire contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or intentionally estimating its costs too low with the intention of avoiding a fundamental obligation to call a European procurement procedure is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">Choosing the type of proceedings is very important for preventing corruption, as restricting competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, an important part of the procurement documents is a detailed justification for the type of procedure chosen, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented the EU's legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and narrower procedures as well as for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and narrower procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are only allowed if the conditions laid down by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public call for participation in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted procedures, are permitted only exceptionally, where permitted by legislation.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions must be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of open management preference is intended to ensure that the restriction of competition is prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (previously selected specific candidates) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is at the heart of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the costs of building projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for building types, building units, construction parts and partial construction works.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public contracts for ground construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, cost determination is based on an estimate by the project-funded entity or based on the value of the resources available to that body.</seg>
<seg id="311">The standardisation measures are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">Based on the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011-2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of standardised commodities prices.</seg>
<seg id="313">The application of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the determination of the subject-matter of the contract in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to set unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued prescriptive prices for transport constructions for their control, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is designed to determine the price of a project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of construction work preparation.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation and thus complied with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, the share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of blanket control, BRH found, on the basis of information collected from more than 16,000 proceedings, that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public proceedings and a public challenge, and limited procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, tenders in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were between 6% and 10% higher than in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Inspectorate confirmed the differences in value for money raised in public and limited management.</seg>
<seg id="327">A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated at more than €5 million (€125 million). CZK), audited contracting authorities generally prepared tender plans specifying which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of works awarded under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">There has been no case of circumvention of the requirement for European management in the form of an exorbitantly low cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases the minimum proportion for pan-European proceedings has not been achieved as a result of the calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of the work, some contracting authorities illegally changed the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes in any way and did not show that the minimum share of European management was subsequently respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a rule, the share of European management by project accounts was lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected values of construction project contracts exceeded European limits, contracting entities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-parts values exceeding €1 million (€25 million). CZK).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving good reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of procurement procedure type</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. the construction of a road section, equipment for a large sports event and the construction of flats), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these partial orders were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division resulted in a reduction in the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding regime or even outside the regime of the law.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the expected price</seg>
<seg id="343">Price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective instrument for setting the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices set out in the completed procedures, but they were burdened with both wastefulness and excessive profit for suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the ring road were about 37% lower than these price standards.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update standards in relation not only to past prices, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For land buildings, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or on the investor's estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then varied considerably from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated cost of building a large library was twice as high compared to the contract price, but increased by CZK 54 million during the implementation. CZK, i.e. 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased further during the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">For the construction of a large library, it was 400 miles. CZK, i.e. 22%. For the construction of the Palace of Justice, the actual price during the construction process increased disproportionately (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (only by 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of type of procurement procedure and on respect for European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national adjustments of the two countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public procedures in Germany is stricter than the European arrangements and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public call for participation gives opportunities for more competitors to participate in a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value effect for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened as the circle of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixing prices among bidders.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference of open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or narrower procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition on contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in narrower procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">Closer proceedings have now come very close to open proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authority largely fulfils the requirement of a preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, for some projects carried out in Germany, European limits were not respected, resulting in a minimum share of pan-European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">A satisfactory system has not yet been introduced in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of expected costs of construction work and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive checks, that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or should create the conditions necessary to allow for the correct calculation of expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">Where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and procurement announcements are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">Through prior notifications, the contracting authority must provide the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary notifications are required for projects where the estimate of total costs is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority is obliged to publish a procurement notice with detailed information for all public contracts that require a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information is binding on the contracting authority after publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notification shall include specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.</seg>
<seg id="376">To describe the subject-matter of the contract, a common dictionary must be used for public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notifications at national level are not to contain any additional information and are not to be published before the text of the EU Publications Office's notification is sent.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in a pre-notification may violate competition or even ease manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notifications must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures may not be initiated until one month after the prior notification has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of the provisional information may be waived only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procedures, the public appeal must be published on the Federal Government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted procedures without competition from participants, a notice must be published where the estimated price of the contract is equal to or greater than €25,000 ($625,000).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">Dividing projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Prior notification</seg>
<seg id="396">Contracting entities published a pre-notice notice on projects that included the work to be commissioned in the European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open proceedings, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the prior notification and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other summary procedures, the annual periods applicable to the provisional information expired and should have been renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the anticipated division of the works into multiple parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Notice of initiation of a procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="401">Some notifications contained codes from the common dictionary that deviated from the pre-notification content or did not specify precisely the work to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="402">In rare cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on delivery dates, or were published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting authority hired an external company to publish a national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published a notice on its platform, the use of which has been charged.</seg>
<seg id="406">But the contracting authority did not check if the company had to comply with the request to send a further notice to a free online government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample revealed that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">SAO</seg>
<seg id="409">Notice of initiation of a procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="410">When constructing a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out in the notification of the shortlisted procurement procedure for the construction contractor the criteria according to which it would reduce the large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The method of selection (reduction) of the tenders for the evaluation was not able to be substantiated by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="412">Reducing the number of bids was made possible by previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the construction of the road circuit, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice of initiation of a narrower procedure or in the qualification documentation of the values by which it would assess the degree of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of bidders to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the short term complied with it, but excluded one of them, saying that it fulfilled only in the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's action was not transparent as it did not disclose in advance information on what the qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Disclosure of calls</seg>
<seg id="417">For building modifications in former military installations, the contracting authority did not disclose, in violation of the law, a written invitation to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage pre-information information process and the publication of the notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency and strengthening of the competitive environment applied in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of restricted procedures, both countries increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Contrary to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow participation to all potential bidders who would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the contracting authority shall first select potential suppliers to be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow the number of candidates in European restricted procedures to be capped.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, a restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential bidders must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any event, the number of candidates invited must be broad enough to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control to ensure that this procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting authorities should replace the tenderers they invite to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permissible to limit competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of candidates and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three candidates are required to be invited in the case of a restricted procedure and, in the case of a negotiated procedure, several suitable candidates.</seg>
<seg id="441">Apart from two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow the number of candidates contacted to be limited in the case of a narrower and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the "four-ey principle" must be respected when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes a list of them, another must substantially modify this proposal, e.g. by removing the proposed candidate or installing another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is intended to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively establish a range of candidates who take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">If such a provision is not in place, a far-reaching illegal agreement between the participants is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">This is also indebted to authorized independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor is there any measure for confidential treatment of the list of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under German provisions, they may not designate candidates for external society, but may make proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">In addition to a few cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of candidates has been met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7,000 terms of reference for works with a value up to the national limit showed that, in the case of limited procedures, contracting authorities called for an average of 6.6 potential bidders and, in the case of a direct negotiation procedure, an average of 4.4 bidders.</seg>
<seg id="456">Changing suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">The contracting authorities, especially in the area of building construction, did not change the circle of contacted bidders because they had had good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee that they would reach out to tenderers whose suitability they had already secured in advance.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the range of candidates in the non-public procedure included a larger proportion of regional tenderers than in the case of public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="461">Contracting entities explained this to the low amount of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-check principle and proposals from self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">For the most part, contracting authorities ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">They argued, in particular, a lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, it was not apparent from the records who had proposed the tenderer who had been asked to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="466">The check of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was created by self-employed professionals and was accepted unchanged by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="467">Contracting entities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of handling lists of potential candidates</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for invitations to the procurement procedure in a database to which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed the manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of the presumed or accepted bidders, who could then agree on the price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The dossier referred to the reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">When constructing the ring road, those interested did not have information about what the data on their qualifications would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For actions related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the announcement of the procurement procedure for participation in the restricted procedure, the criteria for limiting the number of tenderers have not been established.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight bidders met the qualifications, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then selected the candidates using the random selection method - drawing lots, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion already in the contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent illegal restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">The German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by so-called cross-checking (the four-eye principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of candidates and by prohibiting proposals to select candidates to external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the inspection found that part of those rules had not been applied to a sufficient degree and that an inadmissible restriction of the circle of candidates had not been prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of bids</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase, in which potential bidders can draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documentation they have received, begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and/or a call to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="488">By the time the envelopes are opened, prospective tenderers can submit their bids to the contracting authority and thus apply for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority must comply with the national rules governing this stage of management and prevent potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those provisions shall relate in particular to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that the tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their bids must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Projection offices involved in management should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this procurement procedure stage.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of confusion in the tender documents or if further questions arise, information may be supplied to tenderers only by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="499">Projection offices responsible for drawing up the tender documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Throughout this phase, any contact between the design office and the bidders must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing contact with them can adversely affect competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically submitted offers must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with the printing and distribution of documentation, and their staff must be obliged to comply with confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, tenders received must be marked, indicating the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in their original state to the official responsible for safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This worker must not be involved in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">The offers received must be locked up until the closing date of the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The sponsor shall issue a report with the details of the competition, including the offer number and information on the preparation and receipt of the offer.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no specific provisions on the safekeeping of offers.</seg>
<seg id="512">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">BRH checked the terms of the administration building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Sending tender documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The audited contracting authorities of the building administration sent out the tender documents either directly or entrusted its printing and distribution to an external firm.</seg>
<seg id="517">Self-employed workers did not send any documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information provided to tenderers</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the tender documents relating to the questioning and obtaining information, the contracting authority did not follow the decree for separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some notices in the procurement procedure even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, tenderers who raised questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">For the contracting authorities, all accepted tenders were stamped with a stamp and acknowledgement of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases for the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed professionals, violating the rule of one construction of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to them keep in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting entity, the bids were temporarily placed in an open compartment of the mailroom to which all employees had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another sponsor placed the box in the corridor without permanent supervision, and part of the bids thrown into the mailbox stayed there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The box opening was wide and unsecured, and was thus accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">SAO</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not find shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">Rules are laid down in both countries to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices working together in procurement procedures, for the duration of the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="536">For the receipt, custody and confidentiality of tenders, there are appropriate rules to prevent manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, the accumulated control register showed breaches of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These discrepancies can be easily corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of the envelopes, the offers that have been closed so far are opened, their contents are read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period for which the tenderer is bound by his tender begins at the time of expiry of the deadline for submitting envelopes or opening them and ends with a deadline specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national rights and regulations contain extensive requirements for both the protection of tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of "multiple eyes", the transparency and credibility of the envelope opening process are intended to prevent manipulations and modifications of tenders already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">The coincidence with the "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from having hidden manipulation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">Candidates may be present when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="553">When opening, all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and are opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">The tenders received late shall not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this phase, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The entry must include, among other things, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read and signed by the group manager.</seg>
<seg id="557">The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a commission is being set up to open envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts is admitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Members of the Commission may also be entrusted with discussion in the subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of a manager and registrar.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of building construction, the registrar may not be participants in the preparatory phase (making the tender documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and shall not be members in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require that the entry from the opening of envelopes contains not only bidding prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, e.g. damaged envelopes upon receipt or late received offer.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the bidding prices, there must be an indication of the language of the tender and the signature mandate of the tenderer in addition to the bidding prices.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require all parts of the envelopes opened to be marked to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Offers, usually marked in the form of perforation indicating the date, must be kept confidential (secret) at the end of the opening of the envelopes and may be made available only to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no such measures in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope may not be opened and the tenderer must be notified without delay.</seg>
<seg id="571">They do not have this adjustment in Germany and if a single offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Principle of cross-checking</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities adhered to the four-eyed principle.</seg>
<seg id="576">There were always a leader and registrar who was not given a different role.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in rare cases, for small court proceedings, natural persons have opened up tenders that have been sent to them, without the involvement of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">The opening process of envelopes</seg>
<seg id="579">writings from the opening of envelopes have not always documented the course.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, tenders submitted were not marked late and in some cases there were no signatures.</seg>
<seg id="581">Labelling of received bids</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities marked perforation offers with a date, which was in line with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Some of them have mislabeled offers in the past, but have changed practice after warnings from BRH.</seg>

<seg id="586">Deadline for receipt of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">In road repairs, a bidder's bid was handed over a month late for one event, and he accepted it anyway.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">Substantial parts of the provision when opening envelopes are identical in both countries to the principle of "multiple eyes" and the principle of transparency, thus making it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">The marking, safe retention and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes to the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, workers responsible for opening envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must review and evaluate the tenders received within the time limit set.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating bids in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step examines the suitability of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or embezzlement must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Offers of excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable offer and, in particular, examine all significantly low price offers.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">Candidates may, for example, be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be kept in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The outcome of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference of a tenderer or its disadvantage, which may prevent the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take specific measures to select the persons integrated into the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They must also make sure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">Consistent with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the review and evaluation of tenders in step-by-step.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for demonstrating the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weights set out in the notice or the procurement documents shall not be amended.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria set for assessing the suitability of candidates cannot be further applied.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements that might encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they shall be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">Where the evaluation of the tenders results in a finding of a disproportionately low bid price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before the possible withdrawal of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be documented transparently.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, tenderers must remain silent and only authorised persons may participate in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="621">The mathematical accuracy of tenders can only be reviewed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">Assessments may only be entrusted to staff who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the choice of supplier or in the project implementation phase.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating tenders, they must be aware that the offers are confidential and respect that fact honestly.</seg>
<seg id="625">They can only make proposals to the contracting authority for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, bids must be reviewed and evaluated by a commission appointed by the contracting authority, which will draw up a report with a draft conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete in Germany, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the candidate does not substantiate them, they must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, not only the total price but also the unit prices must be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the bid price structure shows that prices for parts of the total project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, bidders must be asked to explain.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prizes, such tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to individual parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Compensation of valuation is not a reason to exclude the offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers vary in price by 10% or more than the price estimated by the contracting authority or other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and the bidders have not justified these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of a tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, that is not a reason for refusing to award a contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike German contract law).</seg>
<seg id="644">Where there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to limit competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this fact without delay to the competent superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">This must decide on the way forward and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">It must also approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the tenderer with the lowest bid), whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Examination of suitability and procurement criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some recommendations by potential suppliers made by self-employed workers, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases of procurement procedures, insufficient documentation was submitted as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested persons and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed workers or employees of construction offices.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be held exclusively by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">Contracting entities have sought to substantiate this with their lack of human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, self-employed professionals used to review the offers of services of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of tenders and to perform with due care the fulfilment of their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As far as contracting authorities are concerned, there was generally no evidence of whether offers in the custody of self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and mathematical control of bids</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities have handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed verification of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intent to manipulate, third parties could make changes to the bids that could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">The examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the bids were not adequately labelled or where data on prices and products were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A model check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from pre-arranged costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One of the 20 procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate bidding prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of bids or negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was also lacking, for example, about unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">The reason for the derogations were often cited changes in market prices or increases in material costs.</seg>
<seg id="671">Contracting authorities have argued that identifying and proving compensatory prices is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting entity, a 66 % lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">No data on a closer examination of the cost or on the determination of the reasons for the deviations were not recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping for the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority of that tenderer was assessed as a "low-cost company" which was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the tendering procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that the tenderer could be presumed not to have incurred a disproportionately high cost setting of its prices.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two incidents of irregularities were found with one contracting authority, and they were reported to a company responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two bidders submitted bids containing an identical price calculation, prompting the contracting authorities to exclude both bids.</seg>
<seg id="682">The inspections did not show any material shortcomings in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction actions, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities have not excluded tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority referred to in the terms of reference, or did not substantiate the qualifications to the extent required, or, on the contrary, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of the candidate who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">For the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the individual evaluation criteria of the tender procedure for the contractor of the construction were determined, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For actions in the field of railway infrastructure development, the weighting of the evaluation criteria for the award of the contract was not determined at the initiation of the procedure, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the assessment of the criterion of "shortening construction time" was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For bidders in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly stated a greater reduction in the construction time than indicated in their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the candidate</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate on the basis of which criteria it assessed the offers received and how it selected the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">Correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts associated with the construction of a ring road with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="694">The CZK could not be verified because the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of fulfilment, but the documents on these negotiations were not prepared.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of bids correspond to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, it differs in the light of the specific management steps and the selection of individuals involved in the management.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike in the Czech Republic, these steps in the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-price principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some cases of checks, it was found that substantial steps of the process in the verification and evaluation of the bids were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">The checks showed serious defects, such as the transmission of bids to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documenting the tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of the functions associated with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against increased handling options are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">When checking price legitimacy, the audited German contracting authorities did not use the complete set of available instruments in all cases and did not deal with their own pricing structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, deficiencies were identified in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the application of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After examining and evaluating the tenders, the procurement process is completed by awarding the contract or cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its examination where appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The period of 10 days shall apply to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract shall not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the review procedure has expired.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the right to be reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by rapidly implementing the decision of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority must properly document the conduct of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries implemented management information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure lies with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, he cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly carried out examination and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within a specified period of time.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is due to the fact that the tenderer is not bound by its tender after that period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Failed bidders are to be informed of the outcome in a timely manner, stating the reason why their bid was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">The cancellation of the procurement procedure is only permissible if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in tenders do not correspond to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period prior to the conclusion of the contract covers both European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before deciding on its EU provisions and review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the tendering procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only a single tender met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender fulfils the conditions set out in the tender documents and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The checks found few discrepancies in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, European procedures have received authorising letters before the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also, in several cases of open procedures, the authorising letters of modification were incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the time limits for awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the bidder offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">During the reconstruction and construction of the university, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tenderer's tender.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some road repair and maintenance actions, highway construction and ring roads, contracts were concluded later than stipulated by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">For building modifications in former military installations, the contracting authority sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all bidders only after the legal deadline had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries implemented EU rules on the termination of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes an institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding the contract was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings in the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its various stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">Completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the essential requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only a proper and time-consuming decision-making and justification documentation gives a guarantee of transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds the European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">The relevant documentation is also an essential part of the anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to substantiate individual decisions in detail and their merits significantly reduce the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of the EU Publications Office (EU's Office of Official Publications) within 48 days from the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Authority publishes a notification in the EU's Official Journal and this also fulfils the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the essential information on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission issues annual statistics that make it possible to get an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to announce the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those that are mandatory under European law, applies only to limited procedures exceeding the limit of €25 thousand ($625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 ($375,000) including VAT.</seg>
<seg id="771">Only the parties to the proceedings are informed below this limit.</seg>
<seg id="772">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of assignments have not been fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notification did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. the reasons for the delivery specifications and the national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain mandatory requirements.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of award</seg>
<seg id="780">In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of several terms of reference, there was no evidence of disclosure of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting obligation</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistically proven files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent in time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Preliminary transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the contracting authority published information about the outcome of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one contracting authority, contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the contracting authority six months to notice the error.</seg>
<seg id="788">Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not disclosed during that period.</seg>
<seg id="789">SAO</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant deficiencies were identified in the documentation of the course of the procurement procedure, such as incorrect information on bidding prices in the evaluation committee's discussions.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some documents on opening envelopes have not been signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of award</seg>
<seg id="794">In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, the construction of the motorway and the ring road, the announcement of the award of the public contract was sent after the deadline or it was not made public.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.</seg>
<seg id="798">Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.</seg>
<seg id="799">The inspections have identified shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully meet the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Aggregate evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel controls of the SAO and BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process both in the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation gives opportunities to international competition within the EU to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures aimed at preventing corruption are not only to avoid or at least reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audited supervisory findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions, give an internal view of the common and distinct elements which may assist both countries in the further development and application of this right.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries, there is thus an important common base for public procurement and the fulfilment of essential requirements in the field of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting entities reinforce these requirements in part with very large measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has extended the provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures to procedures below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the checks have shown that contracting entities are not always fully in line with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting entities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the aforementioned irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the controls identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">These include, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the public contract, which resulted in additional works which were often awarded in breach of the law, the lack of definition of the anticipated price and the required qualification prerequisites narrowing the possible circle of tenderers and thus reducing competition especially in the field of transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint controls were not intended to detect corruption cases.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, German provisions give room for broad and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">Czech regulations mainly monitor the strengthening of the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles for the prevention of corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles were also included among the procurement requirements and were adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, at times with great precision, ways of complying with the requirements for preventing corruption during the procurement procedure and the selection of persons incorporated therein.</seg>
<seg id="827">In BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (particularly the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, procurement documents and various organisational measures are also an effective mechanism to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions have to comply with in public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting authorities should provide further training to their staff, familiarising them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant proportion of the weaknesses revealed apply to activities delegated by the building administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls in delegating powers increases the risk of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be passed on to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">Anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at the government level in the Czech Republic, which also significantly affect the area of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO's auditing actions took place during the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely a significant change to the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The strategy adopted and the new legal regulations can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">For example, under the new regulations, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the anticipated value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements for the qualification conditions, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of the tenders, and properly document and publish everything properly.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion about the ways of implementing EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">In practice, their broad application has confirmed that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency requirements provide an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The transnational model, introduced in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damage caused as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, organisational structures and procurement procedures should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to practice in Germany, it has emerged that the share of open procurement procedures in the Czech Republic should increase, giving room to competition and substantially reducing the possibility of corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="848">The award of contracts in parts may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where it is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. A higher number of applicants put pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The provision of its organisation also has an impact on the conduct of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="850">It is provided by special state organisations in Germany, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport structures, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and BRH want to further develop knowledge in their work where appropriate and address them with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for effectively tackling corruption and to guarantee that public procurement is awarded in a regime of well-functioning and honest competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel controls on excise duty management in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint final report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The joint report submitted informs about the course and outcome of international cooperation during parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, with a focus on the management of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the highest audit institutions of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the exercise of parallel controls aimed at the administration of excise duties concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel controls was chosen on the basis of the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation to see how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax management system is set up and how the systems in Slovakia and the Czech Republic are different.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out was the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, the finding that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty management was very limited without parallel controls being carried out.</seg>

<seg id="17">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="18">on the results of parallel controls of the SPD administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences were found between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, in the Czech Republic it contributes to the effective administration of excise taxes verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits and the obligatory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and some other oils; In the SR, the distribution of control signs is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against excise tax evasion, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the institute of fuel distributor and the registration of consumer packaging of alcohol has proved to be a good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Revenue from excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's targets of reducing labour taxation, introducing environmentally austerity measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, including because there is no indexation of excise tax rates in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the materiality of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden on excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="26">The state has long supported the implementation of environmental measures financially, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenues, which will need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by reducing state spending.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditures spent on excise tax management in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been growing for a long time, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is declining.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency is also negatively affected by the expenditure on computerising the administration of excise duties (IT expenses) and the expenses incurred on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="29">The electronicisation of excise tax management in the SR did not significantly affect the reduction in the number of tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR recommend to the FŘ SR to reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditures was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures in the audited period that would lead to a reduction in the staffing demands of the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic carry out administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and, given the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities, even more costly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Electronization of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR the administration of tax returns to excise taxes is fully electronized, in the Czech Republic documents proving taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically handed over.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronization support effective administration of excise duties, which is why the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure on the deployment of EMCS could not be compared, as the FŘ SR provided expenditure data only for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was also spent before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenditure incurred in that period only for EMCS upgrades in the SR was about 20% higher than the expenditure incurred in the Czech Republic for both the introduction of EMCS and the upgrade of this system over more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="40">The administrators of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not reach comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the SR the administration of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but in the Slovak Republic to a lower extent, as significantly higher expenditure was incurred on the introduction of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation between the two audit institutions was carried out on the basis of the Cooperation Treaty in the implementation of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties of 18 August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic have agreed to carry out parallel controls that will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and the results of which will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the established facts.</seg>
<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel controls were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the subject and the parallel control objective:</seg>
<seg id="48">The parallel controls aimed to compare the performance of excise administrators, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify the weaknesses of the excise tax administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit issues should have been answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did excise administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures?</seg>
<seg id="51">Was the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duties (EMCS) to streamline the management of excise duties and was the cost of implementing it effectively incurred?</seg>
<seg id="52">The parallel checks carried out were to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.</seg>
<seg id="53">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The General Directorate of Customs (DG) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (FD SR) have joined a joint declaration on mutual cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries, the objectives of this declaration include the areas of excise duties, including the fight against fraud, exploring the possibility of harmonising legislation and finding harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, exploring the possibility of joint activities to increase efficiency in detecting fraud and sharing experiences and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 The EMCS is operated pursuant to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 establishing an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of the audit carried out by the SAO of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="57">Control number: 15/33</seg>
<seg id="58">Subject of scrutiny: The administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="59">Objective of control: The aim of the SAO control of the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of customs authorities in the administration of excise duties, especially when monitoring transport in the system of conditional exemptions from excise duties and when securing tax (customs debts); to examine whether the system of administration of excise duties is set up to ensure the efficiency of the collection of revenues of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="60">Controlled period: 2012-2015 and, in case of factual context, periods prior to and downstream</seg>

<seg id="63">Control number: KA-023/2016/1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Subject of scrutiny: The administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="65">Objective of control: The aim of the inspection was an independent and objective examination of whether the FCH SR and the customs authorities (CÚ) in the administration of excise duties function economically, efficiently and effectively in accordance with generally binding legislation.</seg>

<seg id="67">Controlled person: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation for excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">The excise tax administration legislation is divided into the level of EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/EC, on the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, defines excise duty and lays down basic rules for the management of taxes and the management of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive makes it possible to impose taxes on consumption on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">EU legislation regulates in particular the minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of product selected, the production, storage, processing and possession of products subject to tax, tax exemption and refund, supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation makes it possible to introduce control procedures and institutes at national level, provided they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Legislative of excise duties in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, excise tax legislation is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of the tax on mineral oils, taxes on alcohol, taxes on tobacco products, beer taxes, wine tax and intermediate products and taxes on raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="77">This law defines forms of disposal of products subject to excise duties, tax payers, authorisation procedures, conditions for the transport of products, tax returns and penalties for infringements of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">The law and subsequent decrees further regulate certain other conditions for the management of mineral oils (branding mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No 261/2007 Coll., on the stabilisation of public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are contained in special legislation. The Fuel Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation govern the conditions for the sale, dispensing, distribution of fuel and keeping of the registration of fuel put into free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No. 61/1997 Coll., on alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No. 307/2013 Coll., on Compulsory Alcohol Labelling, and the relevant implementing regulations provide for mandatory marking of alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for handling control tapes and conditions for the handling of alcohol (i.e. for production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, takeover, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">The procedures for tax proceedings, which are not specified in special regulations, are governed by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Penalties are imposed by procedures under Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Administrative Code.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for the issuance of a trade licence (concession) to operate a trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, modification and sale of fermentation, alcohol of consumer and spirits" are regulated by Act No. 455/1991 Coll., on Trade Licensing Business (Trades Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has used the power to introduce control procedures and institutes for controlling the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and for monitoring compliance with the legislation when dealing with selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as when dealing with selected products for which the tax has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These are monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking some other mineral oils, labelling tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic has used the right to apply excise duty to other products and introduced an excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of legislative changes for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">On the basis of the Government of the Czech Republic's resolution of 3 October 2012 No 735, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market for spirits," there were major legislative changes in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015 introducing a number of measures against excise duty fraud.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were also substantial changes in the legislation on mineral oil tax, tobacco products tax and the criminality of preparing the tax cut.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal protection of tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminality of preparing the offence of "reduction of tax, fee and similar compulsory payment" is introduced. The adjustment made should allow police authorities to take more effectively and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, such as the deployment of operational search means.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions for excise duty management</seg>
<seg id="95">The issue of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act shall be subject, with effect from 1 January 2015, to: reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; the right to operate a trade enabling the pursuit of an activity related to authorisation; a situation where the claimant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of the emergence of tax arrears, namely by reducing operators with a licence to deal with products subject to excise duty taxation.</seg>
<seg id="97">The economic stability condition newly allows the tax authority to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both within the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation has been issued.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities that do not have sufficient financial income to properly comply with their tax obligations in order to dispose of the products selected.</seg>
<seg id="99">Indicators have been established to assess the economic stability of the proposer (capacity, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, it is also up to the administrative discretion of the tax administrator with regard to the individual conditions of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law stipulates the periodicity of examining the fulfilment of the condition of economic stability due to the timeliness of the data - the screening takes place once a year following the deadline for filing a return on income tax.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax administrator has the possibility to set other conditions needed for the administration of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the authorisation holder does not comply with the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the authorisation or, if necessary, cancel the permit.</seg>
<seg id="104">Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable at a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of tax security (e.g. repeated beneficiaries).</seg>
<seg id="105">The permit was revoked by 10 entities, other applicants increased the tax collateral, capitalised their deposit into the company or substantiated up-to-date accounting data, according to which they had already fulfilled all the conditions for issuing the permit.</seg>

<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, Scheme A) from the production of raw alcohol through the marking of control tape to its distribution to the final seller or the authorized user of the exempt spirit.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, the supervision of customs authorities is also subject to production facilities for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the management of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons, and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most significant measures are: The records of the production, reception, inventory and the issuance of alcohol contain information on the amount of alcohol according to the stages of alcohol production and processing, indicating the document numbers.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limiting the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and limiting the number of packages with broken control tape at the point of sale or issue to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other container of max. one litre or three litres if it is a container made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Spirits in larger packages are viewed as unmarked, which it is forbidden to dispose of.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of the final sale to a natural person for his personal consumption, there may be a maximum of one consumer pack with broken control tape, or three if they are fitted with a single-way valve.</seg>
<seg id="125">Mandatory registration of a person who lists ethyl alcohol in products in consumer packaging having at least 15 % volumetric alcohol for free tax circulation and is: importer of alcohol, alcohol producer in the Czech Republic or operator of a tax warehouse under a conditional exemption regime, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="126">Personal terms - reliability, integrity and failure to declare a disqualification - must be met by the applicant and the person in the capacity of the statutory body or the responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="127">The applicant must provide a deposit of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €3,700 to €185,000), depending on the anticipated amount of control strips taken.</seg>
<seg id="128">The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place for alcohol marking and the equipment of the marking point or tax warehouse with a camera surveillance device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="129">The registration markings of the control tape are introduced for the marking of spirits with a volume of more than 0,06 litres.</seg>
<seg id="130">When carrying control tapes, the registration marking of control bands shall be included in the transport documents or customs declaration at the time of export.</seg>
<seg id="131">The control tape until 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration number, the application code for the allocation of control tapes and a classification code according to the level of volume concentration of ethanol.</seg>
<seg id="132">The control tape from 1.12.2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in consumer packaging expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, with rounding to the whole milliliters downwards.</seg>
<seg id="133">The register of control bands to mark spirits contains daily entries on individual ways of handling control tapes according to the registration codes, as well as documents on the basis of which the registration took place.</seg>
<seg id="134">In the event of the destruction, loss or theft of specific control tapes, their holder is obliged to notify the tax administrator by electronic means the registration code of the control tapes concerned and their number on the following working day following the operative event.</seg>
<seg id="135">Introducing the new facts of the offences and adjusting the level of penalties imposed for infringements of the legislation when dealing with control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="136">Penalties may be imposed up to or exceeded by up to ten times the amount of excise duty (e.g. when control strips are destroyed or lost in a number exceeding 0,1 % of the total quantity of the individual orders of control tapes made, if the control tape is not returned within the statutory time limit).</seg>
<seg id="137">Restrictions on the handling of control tapes only to registered holders who may not assign them to another person, with the exception of providing them to a foreign supplier for the purpose of indicating spirits in consumer packaging manufactured outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">The checked tapes exported must be placed on consumer packaging and imported back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of a distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging, subject to the fulfilment of similar personal conditions as for the person obligated to mark alcohol and with the obligation to deposit a deposit of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. around €185,000).</seg>
<seg id="140">Defining persons for the sale or purchase of alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="141">Authorised persons are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or final sellers, or they may sell them as final sellers.</seg>
<seg id="142">They can pick up alcohol from other registered persons, insolvency administrator, administration, organisational units of the state or non-registered persons in the execution of tax execution.</seg>
<seg id="143">Notices of the inclusion of alcohol or sale in consumer packaging for free tax circulation shall be required to send the alcohol to the tax administrator immediately the following day after the relevant fact to the tax administrator through an information system maintained by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or while respecting the content in the xml format.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification shall include the number of control bands used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the volume percentage of alcohol, the European goods code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or the final vendor, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.</seg>
<seg id="145">Tax entities sent about 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compulsory concession (specific form of trade licence) not only for the production and modification of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in consumer packaging by the entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or business license to a natural person for his own internal use.</seg>
<seg id="147">Concession trades can only be performed once a decision is made by the Trade Licensing Authority upon the fulfilment of professional competence and other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="148">No prescribed professional qualification is required for the sale of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="149">The benefit for tax administrators is an overview of retailers and their establishments and restrictions</seg>
<seg id="150">trading on reliable entities.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the Czech Republic, for a field including the production, treatment of fermentation, alcohol of consumerism, spirits and other alcoholic beverages, and sales were registered in 2014 about 94 thousand and in 2015 about 104 thousand concessions.</seg>
<seg id="152">Checks on compliance with legislation in the field of handling products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic also ensure in their activities outside the tax administrator: trade licensing offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the authorities of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the authorities of the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.</seg>
<seg id="153">If it finds that there has been a breach of the obligation or a breach of the prohibition, it shall inform the excise administrator without delay.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Scheme B), to which mineral oils loaded with excise duties are subject, but also selected mineral oils of excise duty unburdened, which have been misused for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from mineral oil production through storage, transport, marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils, marking of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, mineral oil consumption.</seg>
<seg id="157">Customs supervision also includes the manufacture of markings for the marking of mineral oils and the management of these substances.</seg>
<seg id="158">The labelling and colouring of selected mineral oils are subject to mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (petrol other), 2710 19 29 (other not elsewhere specified medium oils) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 unless their tagging is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">The labelling of certain other mineral oils is subject to e.g. benzol, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion.</seg>
<seg id="160">Mark and colour selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils with a marker is only possible on the basis of the tax administrator's permission.</seg>
<seg id="161">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="162">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils, which is a group of mineral oils under the Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: the flash point is less than 150 °C, the distillation test shall be at least 20 % of the volume, including losses up to a temperature of 350 °C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils were misused as an addition to finished fuel, in particular diesel, or were directly used or sold for engine propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Registration with the tax administrator shall be subject to entities dealing with monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres.</seg>
<seg id="167">In order to issue a marketing authorisation, the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the representative responsible must be met, which applies throughout 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.</seg>
<seg id="168">3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="169">4 For example, when mineral oil is used as fuel (excluding water navigation if they are not private pleasure craft) or as components for the production of fuel, if the markings are of a defect in their use.</seg>
<seg id="170">registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">As of 30 November 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, on the proposal of the marketing authorisation holder, four registrations were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="172">Electronic registration shall include detailed information on the receipt, self-consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil including document numbers, numbers of notification of acquisition to the tax administrator, place of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption, or on sale, place of delivery and registration number of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="173">Notification of any acquisition of special mineral oil must be made to the tax authorities at intervals of 24 to 72 hours before admission.</seg>
<seg id="174">Identification of business partners, name and nomenclature of special mineral oil, quantity, purpose of consumption or sale or transfer information shall be reported.</seg>
<seg id="175">The notification of the anticipated quantity in the relevant year of the acquired, sold or consumed mineral oil shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, storage or consumption point, identification data of the person who is further sold or transferred by the special mineral oil shall be transmitted before each change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications are submitted electronically via smart forms or a PDFa data box.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.</seg>
<seg id="179">The seizure and forfeiture of special mineral oils or, where appropriate, means of transport must be pronounced by the tax administrator in cases where it finds the handling of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to comply with his notification obligation.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of failure to comply with obligations in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied retrospectively.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are entitled to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="183">Compulsory licence of the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The application for a concession or, where appropriate, the appointment of the responsible representative, shall be given an opinion by the customs office examining whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the applicant's statutory body - the legal person and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">Where such persons satisfy the condition of reliability, the customs office shall issue an affirmative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person means a person of integrity, in terms of a criminal-law property nature, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">The condition for the issuance of the concession is professional competence.</seg>
<seg id="188">The integrity of the same circle of persons as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">The debtor is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will properly and timely fulfil his payment obligations towards the state, i.e. he does not have arrears to the state budget and on general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">The fuel distributor shall not be subject to a prohibition by the court or administrative authority of the activity preventing the pursuit of its activities.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fuel distributor shall not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="192">The deposit (if any bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. about €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e. approx. €370,000) after three years of registration by a fuel distributor and the fulfilment of other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="193">Notice of distribution of fuel is required by the distributor to the customs office within 20 days after the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">The electronic notification shall include details of individual fuel purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id="195">The reported data are details of business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, loading point and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="196">The right to refund the tax on mineral oils consumed in agricultural primary production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">The refund of excise duty on mineral oils can only be claimed for that activity which is manifestly linked to the activity carried out on land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were about 64,000 claimed refund claims totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e. €43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced the refund of excise duty on fuel to livestock farmers.</seg>
<seg id="200">Newly, farmers or breeders who deal with cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats, for example, will be able to claim this entitlement.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term below-budgeted revenue from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced, with effect from 1 December 2014, a restriction on the sale of tobacco products at the old rate of tax in the event of a change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco sticker means its placement on unit packing (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the application of the rate of excise duty, the production of a tobacco product in a state intended for the final consumer is decisive, with no need to remove it, supply, dispatch or sale or sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet characterising the excise duty rate is shown on the tobacco label together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, the label also lists the number of pieces in the pack or the amount of smoking tobacco in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">The tobacco sticker has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packs of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label with a previous (old) rate of tax was established until the end of the last day of the second calendar month following the application of the new rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="210">The evolution of tobacco stickers in 2014 and the comparison with developments in previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly frontloaded tobacco products with an "old" tax rate each year, resulting in a de facto shift in the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Tax on raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the production of tobacco products without the authorisation of the tax administrator and the non-payment of excise duty, a raw tobacco tax and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as anti-tax fraud measures.</seg>
<seg id="213">With effect from 1 July 2015, the excise duty shall be subject to raw tobacco which has not been used or delivered for the manufacture of tobacco products to another Member State or third country or for which the origin, use or person to be supplied or to be supplied with raw tobacco has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on dealing with raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as the supervision of the transport and production of tobacco products, the marking of unit packs with control tape and the restriction of sales at the designated sites have been supplemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">Production equipment for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products is not subject to the supervision of customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or modified.</seg>
<seg id="218">Only a person who meets the personal circumstances of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which is valid throughout the registration.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions of registration are: (a) the authorisation to operate a trade allowing the performance of the activity of the person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) indebtedness, (d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been banned from operating activities, (e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the provision of a deposit of 20 000 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 740 000 €).</seg>
<seg id="220">Electronic registration shall include the date of receipt or dispensing of raw tobacco, the document number, identification of the trading partner, the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a person storing raw tobacco shall be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">Details of the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the address of storage, the purpose of use and the details of the carrier shall be reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">The notice of the anticipated quantity in the relevant year of received or dispatched raw tobacco shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications are submitted electronically by a PDFa data box.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed essentials.</seg>
<seg id="226">Legislative of excise duties in SR</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating excise duties in the SR is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Individual types of excise taxes are exhaustively determined by SR legislation, which is similar to the legislation of the surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="230">The legislative regulation of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to individual subject-matter of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonisation was achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All excise tax laws are rules of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject-matter of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No 563/2009 Z. z., on tax administration (tax rules), is a matter of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax entities and others.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework transposed the individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 on the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and transposed the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European Community.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of legislative changes for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In EMCS, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duties under a conditional exemption scheme has been changed from a documentary accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where these services are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Under the EMCS electronic system, an institute of suspension of access to EMCS was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the option of suspending access precisely on justified concern about the non-payment or undetermined tax on previous tax periods and its unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This applies to the maturity of the tax, as the transport of excise goods requires the composition of the collateral, which shall, however, be released by the end of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">The gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The abolition of red diesel was aimed at reducing the public deficit, simplifying the system for taxing mineral oils and reducing the administrative burden on the business entities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal change was to introduce a registration obligation for all petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">Clarification of the movement of taxed gasoline and diesel is linked to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new institute institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely a fuel distributor and a fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">That change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and clarified the movement of these propellants (see Annex 4, Scheme A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">In the SR, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to designate an indication.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">In order to combat tax evasion and the monitoring of tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Materials Act has been extended and a new tax entity - a tobacco raw material trader - has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition, an obligation was introduced to record technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation has brought about a new system for ordering, judging, printing, distribution and use of check marks designed to mark consumer packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The checkpoint refers to cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the purchaser of the check marks must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks by means of an information system for the collection of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnice Mincovna.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of the tax oversight of the printing of control stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system for printing check marks strengthens the goods control system, as a unique identification number is generated on the check mark, which can simply verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place is the check sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a checkpoint or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The checkpoint intended for the labelling of cigarettes must also indicate the price of cigarettes, the emblem for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in consumer packaging and the length of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer because the original three substantive law regulations were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was developed mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of the taxation of alcoholic beverages, the management of their production, the monitoring of movements, the provision of the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, to streamline the performance of tax administration, to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of addressing the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a uniform rate of excise duty on alcoholic beverage and took into account the volume percentage of actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">For non-fat wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of actual alcoholic strength in the final product is taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage of the actual alcoholic strength in the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented self-consumption drink and for the consumption of his household for a maximum of 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation has brought about a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using check marks for labelling consumer alcohol packaging.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the purchaser of the check marks must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks by means of an information system for the collection of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnice Mincovna.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of the tax oversight of the printing of control stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Schedule B) and the elimination of falsification of control signs.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system for printing check marks strengthens the goods control system, as a unique identification number is generated on the check mark, which can simply verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place is the check sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a checkpoint or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise taxes on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common Act No. 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Solid fuel tax, tax on natural gas and certain other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In contrast, in the Slovak Republic, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the Excise Tax Act on alcoholic beverages, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, as of 1 January 2015, the issue of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is conditional, among other things, on the demonstration of the economic stability of applicants, which customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce tax security.</seg>
<seg id="292">FŘ SR exercises tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is provided by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not introduced in the printing works by customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="295">He will take the tobacco stickers and control tapes from the printer commissioned territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, the control tapes to mark alcohol are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the location of the marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the SR there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its part, in the Czech Republic such an obligation is not introduced.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears the excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when collecting tobacco stickers at the designated customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the SR, on the other hand, the control mark does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the Czech Republic in the case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, the so-called green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In the SR, such support for farmers is not introduced (it existed until 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">To strengthen the fight against tax fraud, bail of CZK 20 million was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. CZK (i.e. 740 thousand €).</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors was reduced from 1,891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">A similar institute of a fuel distributor is introduced in the SR, but without the deposit of the deposit needed to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">There were 303 distributors registered in the SR in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the SR, an institute of a fuel seller and a fuel consumer is in place, which is authorised by the locally competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">Such an institute is not introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labelling, in the Slovak Republic, after the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirit drink, according to which a record of control tapes is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">Destruction, loss and return of the control tape are entered in the register the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape is obliged to notify their use within the same time limit.</seg>
<seg id="314">In SR, the control mark intended to mark alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax administrator and is used to verify the authenticity of the check mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register contains the number of collected, used and claimed check marks.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced the institute of mandatory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="317">In the SR, registration is subject to compliance with, inter alia, a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover from the sale of a consumer pack of alcohol at least €100,000 or a paid-up equity of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining a registration is subject, among other things, to deposit a deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In Slovakia, the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging requires a permanent presence of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of a person obligated to mark alcohol with the condition of posting bail in favour of the tax administrator from CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) depending on the amount of control strips collected and the installation of a tracking device with the continuous approach of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia far exceeds the EU's minimum requirements for subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as to the risks identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted in the audited period allow tax administrations to more pre-empt the emergence of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. sheets), an excise tax on raw tobacco or tobacco raw material has been introduced beyond EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not a harmonised tobacco product, they monitor both the Czech Republic and Slovakia's movements.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic can recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability for applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has proved successful because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such vetting also in SR conditions.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of check marks in the Slovak Republic is more efficient than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs authorities with the costs associated with transport between the printer and the customer of control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The SR Financial Administration has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more efficient, because the tobacco sticker order itself is a tax return with a subsequent tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="333">Thanks to the introduction of "propellant sellers" and "fuel consumer" institutes, the financial administration in Slovakia has a better overview of fuel sales points.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of mandatory mineral oil labelling in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or exempt.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and in SR (2014) a new control tape, or a stamp containing the identification code, was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in Slovakia the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">The impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol by a control mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic may also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-ient approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">By contrast, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive because it introduces a bail burdening the cash flow of tax entities, but it further reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of income from excise duties</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State to increase the revenue of the state budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to the individual and/or to society (regulatory functions of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Communication from the Commission: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.3.2010 under the flagship initiative Europe less resource-intensive, the European Commission's intention is to improve the market-based framework for the use of instruments, including in the form of a revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy consumption and resources.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from the workforce, including to energy and environmental taxation, as part of greater "environmental" tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of tax revenues from excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and share of GDP is also monitored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), among others.</seg>
<seg id="348">Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter a query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP fell slightly, according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">The exchange rate of the European Central Bank of the ECB was used to convert the amounts in CZK to EUR 31.12. of the relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of collection of excise duties, excise duties and income per capita in € have decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off shortfall in excise duty revenues from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of old-tax tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also influenced by the rise in revenue tax collection, which has grown significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">The excise tax on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the total collection of excise duties (about 55.7% in 2015), but this fell despite significant economic growth compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as anti-tax fraud measures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of environmentally-saving vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible share is the tax on natural gas, the tax on solid fuels and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the future, if there is no rate hike, their share will decline in the future in view of the ever-increasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale case of tax fraud consisting in the marketing of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such conduct and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded by EUR 4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of the tax on tobacco products increased as a result of rising rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duties changed between 2012-2015 for the tobacco tax, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">Due to the CNB's currency intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, in addition to the tobacco product tax, has fallen significantly. It has risen only slightly for tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the excise tax rate is not set, so the function of excise taxes to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the rise in living standards, real rates of excise duties are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment takes place on the basis of a law or contract (for pensions paid by the State, it is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="371">The current legislation on excise duties in the SR does not address the indexation of the level of excise duty rates on consumer price developments because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="375">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all the excise taxes introduced in Slovakia, it is the excise tax on mineral oils that accounts for the largest share of the national budget's full-year tax revenues, while its share did not fall below 52% in the whole audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">The second largest share is excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">This tax accounts for an average of around 32% of total collection from excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per inhabitant of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to a rise in excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth in excise duty collection per inhabitant of the SR is constant and corresponds to the evolution of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention on the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2.7 times higher in the Czech Republic, respectively 2.8 times higher, per inhabitant of the Czech Republic, however, the collection for these selected products is already only about 1/3.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower excise tax rates in the Czech Republic and the CZK exchange rate against foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">The mineral oil tax also causes greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of a tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a not insignificant effect.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation of Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic fell as a result of the CNB's interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift from labour taxation to tax the consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the achieved values of the share of excise duties are consistently above average compared to the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is mainly influenced by the change in excise duty rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future shortfalls in excise duty collection due to environmental measures subsidised by the State in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenues or by reducing state spending.</seg>
<seg id="392">By not introducing an indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their regulatory functions are reduced and the EU's objectives of a less dependent environmentally dependent on environmentally unsparing sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco are insufficiently supported.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic shows higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The efficiency of the tax administrator in tax administration is influenced by the scope and organisational layout of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The determination of the efficiency of the administrative costs of tax administration by the conversion coefficient method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a line-based structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organizational unit of the state and the accounting unit.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs authorities are an internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included collectively for the entire organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, in view of the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, the expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some sub-control operations are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">In particular, the administration of excise duties shall be carried out by the following departments:</seg>

<seg id="434">Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a challenging transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The formation of the FŘ SR was also reflected in the composition of the employees of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In relation to the performance of excise duty management, excise duty management activities within the organisational structure of the FŘ SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related unions.</seg>

<seg id="445">The Customs Section was established during 2012; individual customs offices (9 customs offices) which have territorial jurisdiction designated by higher territorial units were directly incorporated under it, with the exception of one customs office established, inter alia, to carry out tasks in relation to the external border of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">the separation of excise duties - the pursuit of a methodological activity in relation to branches of customs offices and to customs offices' stations; performs direct acts of the tax administrator for selected entities, and this decides on the registration (tax warehouse, authorised recipient repeated, registered consignor), on the amount of tax security, fixes and returns tax, carries out tax supervision and tax control; decides to waive the suspension of the obligation to safeguard the presence of a customs office employee in a liquor tax warehouse;</seg>

<seg id="450">customs office station - the exercise of tax supervision of the holding and movement of excise goods; ensures the exercise of permanent tax supervision in a liquor tax warehouse; decides on the security and forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">SR's financial administration's spending on excise tax management is steadily rising as, with the exception of wage growth, investment increases in effective tax administration and computerisation of financial management.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although revenue from excise duties rose, spending grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenses in the Slovak Republic are significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses, which the Czech Republic does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on excise tax management increased significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, this growth was mainly due to increases in wage expenditure and technical support expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties also grew at approximately the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Wage expenses in the Czech Republic are positively influenced compared to the Slovak Republic by the wider competences of the customs administration, e.g. the weighing of trucks, the control of the fulfilment of obligations in connection with the myth.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly deteriorating trend year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew.</seg>
<seg id="459">In the Czech Republic, too, the number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew more slowly compared to SR.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor in the worsening efficiency of administrative spending, which can be assessed as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in administering excise duties appears to be a negative factor, confirming an undisturbed number of employees in the field of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="463">In the SR, however, the administration of excise duties at lower revenues is significantly more demanding on staffing capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of excise tax administration</seg>
<seg id="465">The management of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration for activities, traffic supervision, control and search of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The numbers of administrative tasks and managed entities are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrations expresses the effectiveness of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisation and registration for activities are a prerequisite for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to carry out a continuous administration with a view to supervising the fulfilment of the legislation and the conditions laid down by the tax administrator, for which adequate staff resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The indicator monitored was the number of valid permits or registrations to operate on 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the case.</seg>
<seg id="474">The administrative tasks monitored are the most significant actions of the tax administrator (tax declaration, administration of transport in EMCS), or activities which are the sequence of acts concluded by a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Permission and registration for activities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">It is possible to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products on the basis of the tax administrator's permission to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the tax warehouse operator has multiple warehouses, the authorisation for each shall be issued separately, including the security of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. the physical presence of an official and the provision of equipment by the tax administrator's conclusions).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">The operator of a tax warehouse is also registered for tax under Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">Authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products suspended from tax purposes to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to an export point in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replaces the status of registered consignor pursuant to Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include authorisations for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, excluding tax purposes, which are analogous to the authorisation of a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="485">Growing brandy produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (14,300 CZK/hl ethanol) – fruit spirits for growers. It is not tax in stock and the permit for operation is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower intended for personal consumption over the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The registration of cultivation burning, which is kept by the operators of the distillery and made available to the tax authorities, must contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">A beneficiary authorised for the re-admission of selected products and authorised beneficiaries for the one-off acceptance of selected products shall, on the basis of the authorisation of the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, be entitled to accept or repeatedly accept selected products in a conditional system carried from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of selected products exempt from tax is a legal or natural person who accepts and uses, or according to Section 52a or 53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., sells selected products exempt to another user; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="491">Exempt-free products may be accepted and used only on the basis of a final authorisation, and only from the supplier referred to in the permit.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of a permit, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of an authorisation for use or to a user who is entitled to use mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Without a permit, exempt mineral oils may be sold in statutory cases, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year if the user produced them themselves or were created during its operation,</seg>
<seg id="495">exempt mineral oils collected in unit packings of not more than 20 litres intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production, while intended for sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">It is possible to transport exempt selected products with an exemption document.</seg>
<seg id="497">The distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled, after compulsory registration with the tax administrator, to sell or otherwise transfer the ethyl alcohol put into free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="498">The warehousekeeper of raw tobacco is entitled, on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="499">A person dealing with special mineral oils is entitled, on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils which are in bulk or placed in a package exceeding 220 litres.</seg>
<seg id="500">The fuel distributor is entitled, on the basis of the concession issued and the registration of the tax administrator, under specified conditions, to sell fuel in the territory of the Czech Republic, with the exception of the sale of fuel from the service station.</seg>
<seg id="501">The transport of PHM must be accompanied by a tax document, proof of sale or proof of transport, or a delivery plan and bottling tickets.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent before the commencement of transport to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="503">The operator of the petrol station is the owner of the fuel sold at the petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where, on the basis of permission from the building authority, the sale or dispensing of PHM is usually allowed into the fuel tank.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators broken down into: registered – normal sale or dispensing of PHM as a rule to vehicle fuel tanks; with a defined approach – operation generally in various company sites (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, building courts), sales are made here for the other party limited on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel dispensing points only for the operator's own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="506">The pumping station is not the construction or equipment in the form of an operating tank located in operation (e.g. on the chassis) if the fuel is issued for its own use only.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to the permission of the tax administrator and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">To buy, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free tax circulation for resale for resale, natural and legal persons may, on the basis of the authorisation of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="509">They must also be authorised if they purchase or obtain liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">Tax control is a set of actions. Tax control is subject to tax liability, claims made by the taxpayer or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="512">Tax control can be carried out jointly for multiple tax proceedings of one taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="513">Repeated tax control can only be carried out under the conditions laid down by law and justification at the start of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="514">Tax control shall be carried out within the time limit for determining the tax, which is three years, the time limit being extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, bringing criminal proceedings in relation to the tax in question) or building (court proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The time limit for determining the tax shall expire at the latest 10 years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">The tax administrator is not required to carry out a tax check on each taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="517">The start of the tax inspection puts the time limits for the possibility of filing an additional tax return or additional billing by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and reopens the running of the time limit for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">Based on its outcome, the tax may be charged ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administrator searches for evidence and carries out the examination of premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging with tax entities and other persons involved in the tax administration, on the spot outside the premises of the tax administrator (e.g. at the tax entity, at the point of sale, on the road to transport).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and belongings, take samples or secure them.</seg>
<seg id="521">Based on the outcome of the local investigation, tax cannot be separately assessed, but the taxpayer can be asked to file an additional tax return (Section 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">The control of traffic data in EMCS is not a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="523">Ordering control bands to mark alcohol may only be submitted to the tax administrator to the locally competent marking point of the markings by the registered person liable for alcohol and is carried out through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the alcohol marker register.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered amount of control tapes and orders production.</seg>
<seg id="525">He doesn't supervise the production of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">Production is provided by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">A purchaser of control tapes takes control tapes from the tax administrator to the locally relevant marking point.</seg>
<seg id="528">Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco perform the function of a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco sticker corresponds to the amount of the tax liability, whereby the purchaser of the tobacco stickers is obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their removal from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate in the order himself the value corresponding to the amount of tax liability of the ordered tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period applies only if the value of the tobacco stickers is secured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order of tobacco stickers shall be submitted on a form set out by the Ministry of Finance in writing or via a data box with the possibility of using intelligent forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco stickers is provided by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="534">The designated tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (Kutná Hora territorial workplace), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, which further distributes them and further examines their transport, storage and use with customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include proper tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including tobacco sticker orders, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">Included is not the allocation of tax under the customs procedure on the basis of customs declarations and the granting of claims for refunds on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of a business other than for the production of heat or engine propulsion, mineral oils used for agricultural primary production.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with established infringements, a set of successive administrative acts. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: requests for administrative cooperation, response to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, event reports, inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport under a conditional tax exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax administrator of the receiving or sending tax warehouse or authorised recipient.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="540">Authorisation and registration for activity in the SR</seg>
<seg id="541">The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is mainly ensured by the customs authorities and the Department of Excise Taxation of the Section of Customs and Taxation of the SR, whose procedure for administering excise duties is governed by individual excise tax laws and the tax code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws provide not only for the scope of the authorisation for the CÚ and the FD of the SR to administer excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, due to an increase in tax warehouse permits issued, an increase in the registrations of the beneficiary for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation refined the transport of certain bulk mineral oils as well as the notification obligation if they are transported freely or in packaging with a content of more than 150 litres or 230 litres, respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to control and procedure for transport with other goods, such as anti-ticking preparations, oxidative inhibitors, bitumen inhibitors, viscosity improvement products, anti-corrosion products.</seg>
<seg id="545">For lubricating oils, a mandatory indication was introduced regarding the indication of their kinematic viscosity.</seg>
<seg id="546">The approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the SR is set out in the following parts of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Operator of a tax warehouse</seg>
<seg id="548">Under SR's national legislation, when registering a tax warehouse operator under all items of excise duty, a person wishing to operate a tax warehouse must also apply at the same time to register and issue an authorisation to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is the registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, by which the tax warehouse operator obtains legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CÚ shall issue an authorisation to operate a tax warehouse which entitles the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="551">If the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax administrator shall issue a separate licence to operate a tax warehouse for each tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The transport of the subject of excise duty under the suspensive tax regime is monitored electronically through EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">Each shipment generates a unique reference code, the so-called</seg>
<seg id="554">ARC code under which the transport can be tracked online and therefore in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the operator of a tax warehouse is also a person authorised to distribute alcohol, it is obliged to notify electronically the commercial name of the consumer pack of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which it puts into free tax circulation at the latest on the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">The registered consignor is a special type of taxpayer which cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if it dispatches the subject of excise duty under the suspensive regime after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under the national legislation of the SR when registering a registered consignor under all subject-matter of excise duties, a person wishing to dispatch the subject of excise duty under a suspensive exemption scheme after his release under the customs procedure "free circulation" must also apply to the CCA at the same time for registration and the issue of an authorisation to dispatch the subject of excise duty under that scheme.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CU shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time also issue an authorisation to dispatch the subject of excise duty under a suspensive exemption scheme after its release under the customs procedure ‘free circulation’.</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing brandy</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of cultivation brandy is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in a distilling plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the permit from the Ministry itself does not entitle the holder of a permit to operate a cultivation distillery.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order to be able to operate a cultivation distillery, a person must submit an application to the CU for registration and issue a registration certificate for the operator of a distillery.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CU will issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which at the same time authorises the operators of the cultivation distillery for the production of alcohol in the crop distillery.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of growing distillery is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Growing brandy cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislator allows a reduced rate of tax to be applied to alcohol produced in a growing distillery, amounting to 50 % of the standard tax rate, i.e. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced tax rate shall apply to ethyl alcohol produced in a growing distillery of no more than 43 litres per grower and its household per production period in the tax area.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from the 1st 7th current year to the 30th of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore it is possible to apply a multiple reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced within one calendar year, as the alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This is the production of alcohol outside the conditional exemption scheme, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower for the alcohol produced will pay the cultivation brandy not only excise duty and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The grower's brandy will issue a removal certificate to the grower, which serves not only as proof of proof of origin and how to acquire alcohol, but also to pay excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of consumer packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons intending to import consumer packs of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country in business and to put it into free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CPC for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="577">The consumer packaging importer shall not register for the relevant excise duty but shall be issued with a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate authorises the importer to import a consumer pack of alcohol or a consumer pack of cigarettes from the territory of a non-member country.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the check marks, they must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the amount of alcohol or cigarettes it wishes to put into free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="580">The consumer packaging importer must put into free tax circulation only the consumer pack bearing the check mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, it must submit to the customs office the number and identification number of the check marks exported to the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer is obliged to have the number of check marks imported back from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of importation.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds within the meaning of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the event of the release of consumer packaging for free tax circulation, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The consumer packaging importer is not tax in stock.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the consumer alcohol-pack importer is also the person authorised to distribute the alcohol, he is obliged to notify electronically to the CU the commercial name of the consumer pack of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack of alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation at the latest on the date of its entry.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and the elimination of tax evasion, the legislator has introduced a new tax institute for the consumer packing of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person who wishes to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CU for authorisation and comply with the legal conditions (business license for a commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; it has not been withdrawn for ten years for sale; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how to acquire consumer packaging of alcohol, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="592">The holder of the permit shall keep a record for each establishment per calendar month the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol on the last day of the month and the registration of the shortage or surplus in the number of consumer liquor packages received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to buy or otherwise purchase alcohol in consumer packaging in the course of business only from the person authorized for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of consumer alcohol packaging</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and the elimination of tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for distributors of consumer alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person intending to hold a distribution authorisation must apply to the ACT for a distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must meet the legal conditions (business license for a commercial trade licence; the storage area exceeds 200 m2; the annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol at least €100,000 or a paid-up share capital of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees; has no arrears against the customs office; it does not have arrears on compulsory levies; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; it has not been withdrawn for sale for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how to acquire consumer packaging of alcohol, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="600">The holder of the distribution authorisation shall, for each establishment, keep a record for each establishment of the number of received pieces of alcohol consumer packaging, the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol on the last day of the month and the registration of the shortage or surplus in the number of consumer packs of alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of the distribution licence is obliged to buy alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorised for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorised for distribution shall notify the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Retailer of fuel</seg>
<seg id="604">Due to the monitoring of free-tax propellants as well as the elimination of tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely a fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="605">In the territory of the SR there is no special regulation regulating petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="606">That is why petrol stations are incorporated in SR's national legislation as fuel retailers.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person who wishes to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation in the tax area is required to apply to the CU for a sale permit before commencing the sale and provide a document proving that the storage facility is certified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device allowing the amount of mineral oil when receiving and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the fuel seller is a tax warehouse operator, an authorised consignee or a registered consignor, the CU will also automatically issue an authorisation to sell fuel to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">The fuel seller is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep a record of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG per calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CU of the new supplier (distributor) of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="610">The fuel seller is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when delivering the fuel through the car tank, the distributor, when pumping the propellants, the distributor prints a so-called bottling plant from a measuring device embedded in the car tank.</seg>
<seg id="613">That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how fuel is acquired, which also contains the fuel distributor's number allocated by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax administrator in the territory of the SR in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="616">Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks when transporting roadside, so carriers use secondary roadways, circumventing the toll collection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual transport.</seg>
<seg id="617">Also carried out are the transport of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tankers.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times it happens that illegal transport is accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change routes and avoid roadside checks.</seg>
<seg id="619">There is also mixing of propellants with light fuel oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Distributor of propellants</seg>
<seg id="621">Due to the monitoring of free-tax propellants as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the tax area in the course of a business activity in the free tax circulation is required to apply to the customs office for a distribution authorisation before commencing the distribution and to provide a document proving that the storage facility is certified and equipped with appropriate verified measuring equipment, as well as a list of suppliers and purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="623">The fuel distributor is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep separately for each establishment the registration of petrol, diesel or LPG for the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="624">The fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">The fuel distributor can only sell in the tax territory to a fuel distributor, registered to the person or consumer of propellants.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when delivering fuel through a car tank, the distributor prints, when pumping propellants, the fuel seller, or the consumer of propellants, the so-called bottling from the measuring device embedded in the car tank.</seg>
<seg id="627">That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel, which also contains the number of the distributor of the fuel, or the registered person, allocated by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="630">Consumer of fuel</seg>
<seg id="631">The consumer of fuel has a special status in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who buys in the tax territory in the free tax circulation for the own consumption of petrol, diesel or LPG and that mineral oil is stored in a storage facility, the volume of which is 15 000 litres or more, is required to notify the customs office of this fact at the latest before the first placement in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">Motor consumption shall be included in the register by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to legal facts, it is obliged to give the address of the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large shipping companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">Storage equipment shall be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the amount of propellants to be measured when receiving and dispensing (condition, measuring rod).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must only purchase fuel from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required for transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when delivering fuel through a car tank, the distributor prints a so-called bottling from a measuring device embedded in the car tank when pumping propellants to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how fuel is acquired, which also contains the fuel distributor's number allocated by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="643">The tax administrator in the territory of the SR in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the business and meets the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Provided that the conditions laid down by law are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. €2,652 per hl/percent volume of actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to up to 200,000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As it is the production of beer outside the conditional exemption scheme, there is no need for a accompanying document for transport as it is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, it is small family businesses that also run restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own-made beer for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative acts in SR</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter brings the exercise of the tax oversight of excise tax administrations to selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, due to the implementation of more transport in EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="654">By contrast, the biggest decline was recorded year-on-year in 2014, by up to 4.3%, due to fewer completed tax inspections and fewer tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="655">That decrease related to legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax controls</seg>
<seg id="657">By carrying out the tax audit, the CPO ascertains or examines the facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">CÚ staff are shown in the performance of the tax audit by delegation to carry out a tax audit, which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject-matter of the control and the extent of the tax periods checked.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that a controlled tax period can be one month, but also more tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The extent of the tax periods checked is determined by the CPU.</seg>
<seg id="661">The tax audit begins with the drafting of the tax inspection notice.</seg>
<seg id="662">The receipt of the documents will be confirmed by the ACT.</seg>
<seg id="663">The issued documents are obliged to be returned by the CÚ within 30 days of the completion of the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="664">An employee of the CÚ will draw up a report from the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax audit finds a difference in the sum that the audited taxpayer was required to pay, to declare or to which he claimed the refund, the CÚ, together with the protocol to the audited taxpayer, will also send a notice of comment on the findings set out in the Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax inspection shall be terminated on the date of receipt of the Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="667">The deadline for carrying out the tax audit shall be no more than one year from the date of its commencement.</seg>
<seg id="668">The tax inspection for registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once until the day of the expiry of the right to set the tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the abovementioned deadlines because of the uniform procedure of the tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigations</seg>
<seg id="671">A local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains the facts that are needed for tax administration purposes.</seg>
<seg id="672">A CÚ employee writes an enrollment on the local investigation and submits his copy to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="673">When conducting a local investigation, the CÚ employee has the right to unlimited access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The clearing of the quantity of alcohol produced shall be determined in the form of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The facts found are the basis for carrying out tax control.</seg>
<seg id="676">Also in the performance of the local investigation, the CCA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the item.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and the local investigation for individual items of excise duty due to the unification of the tax administrator's procedures.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there was also a change in the area of excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in managing excise duty on alcohol, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative tools for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with the administration of excise duties in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the area of excise tax administration from tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for a tax administrator to be present in a liquor tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation exhaustively defines that it is possible to adopt, issue, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse only in the presence of an ECA employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or sends alcohol only in consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CÚ is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse so that the income, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol is not restricted.</seg>
<seg id="685">The operator of the tax warehouse creates an obligation to safeguard the conditions of the working environment for CÚ employees.</seg>
<seg id="686">On the basis of a contract concluded with the FŘ SR for the premises provided, the CÚ pays the rental costs to the operator of the tax warehouse on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="687">In a tax warehouse in the production, processing or storage of alcohol, the production facilities for the storage of alcohol must be adapted in such a way that the quantities of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, alcohol stored, including stocks of alcohol and alcohol contained therein, can be ascertained at any time.</seg>
<seg id="688">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">If alcohol is not accepted in a tax warehouse, issued, produced or processed, the customs office may waive the obligation to safeguard the presence of a customs office employee, who is obliged to secure that area through the closure of the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this option is not used very often, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators make use of the legal option within the meaning of Law No 467/2002 Z., on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use production facilities to produce alcohol in a distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of the distillate distillate distillate distillery, which must be tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">The exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol is ensured by approximately 250 customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issuing vouchers to collect alcohol control stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of control marks is the sending of an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration subscription number and issuing a voucher for the collection of alcohol control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="695">Alcoholic beverage, which is ethyl alcohol, means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength of more than 1.2 per cent vol.</seg>
<seg id="696">The check mark is intended for the labelling of consumer alcohol packaging.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaging of alcohol is considered to be closed consumer packaging filled with spirit intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging of the Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 may be entered into free tax circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the operator of a tax warehouse, the authorised recipient and the consumer packaging importer, who will put it into free tax circulation, may mark the consumer packing.</seg>
<seg id="700">The check stamp contains, among other things, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number contains the registration number (1-6 instead of the numerical character), the volume of alcohol (7.-11. instead of the numerical character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer pack (12.-14. instead of the numerical character).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original pattern of control mark on alcohol:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration subscription number shall be assigned to each customer by the CU's check marks separately.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a check mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of alcohol, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of consumer packaging, the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer pack and the customer's control mark.</seg>
<seg id="704">National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system for control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and inform the system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control marks intended for the labelling of consumer alcohol packaging.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorised recipient, the consumer packaging importer and the consignee (the customer) of alcohol, may mark the consumer packing.</seg>
<seg id="707">A purchaser of the check marks wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the check stamps is obliged to request their issue, report data arising from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and keep a register of check stamps.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of items of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.</seg>
<seg id="710">The tax administrator also communicates with the purchasers of the check stamps through the electronic system of control stamps, in particular when announcing the number of check marks that the purchaser of the check stamps can remove, or when determining the date of receipt of the check stamps by the customer of the check stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="711">The purchaser of the check marks is obliged to deposit on behalf of the tax administrator funds corresponding to the price of the check marks, which he may withdraw and the amount of which shall be notified to him by the customs office before taking control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the check mark takes into account the amount of the printer's refunds. However, it does not take into account the level of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">The checkpoints are entitled to print the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="714">FŘ SR supervises the handling of control marks and their disposal in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="715">The FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when dealing with checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="716">FŘ SR secures the sale of control stamps to the supplier of check stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="717">Remove check marks can only be taken in the printer from the Financial Directorate employee.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issuing vouchers for the collection of control marks on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="719">The purchaser of the check stamp must ask the CPU to allocate the registration number and issue a voucher for the collection of the check stamp.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be put into free tax circulation if it is marked with a checkpoint.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is only possible to label consumer packs of cigarettes with a checkpoint only in a cigarette company.</seg>
<seg id="722">The purchaser of the check marks may only be a tax warehouse operator, an authorised recipient or importer of tobacco products who wishes to place tobacco products for free tax circulation in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only a check mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the data of which corresponds to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of cigarettes, the emblem of the tax rate and the registration number.</seg>
<seg id="724">Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price shown on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system for control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new information system for control signs was to simplify and inform the system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of check marks designed to mark consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">A purchaser of the check marks wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the check stamps is obliged to request their issue, report data arising from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and keep a register of check stamps.</seg>

<seg id="733">Remove check marks can only be taken in the printer from the Financial Directorate employee.</seg>
<seg id="734">The consumer packing of tobacco with a check mark may be indicated by the operator of the tax warehouse or the importer of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="735">The consumer packing of cigars or cigarillos with a check mark may be indicated by the operator of a tax warehouse, an importer of tobacco products or an authorised recipient.</seg>
<seg id="736">Only a check mark shall apply to the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos, the particulars of which correspond to the emblem for the validity of the rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="737">It is only possible to mark consumer packs of cigarettes with a check mark in the company that made them.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of items of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.</seg>
<seg id="739">Within three working days at the latest, the CÚ shall notify the purchaser of the check marks by electronically the number of check marks he can withdraw, the price of the check stamps and the FŘ SR account number.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CÚ may reduce the number of items of control stamps ordered if there are circumstances on the basis of which it can reasonably be assumed that there may be a tax infringement.</seg>
<seg id="741">FŘ SR will determine the date of receipt of the control stamps by the customer of the check stamps, but no later than 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The date of receipt of the control stamps of the FŘ SR will notify the purchaser of the control stamps through the electronic system of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="743">The verification marks are issued exclusively by the Financial Directorate in the printer, but only after the receipt of funds corresponding to their price to the relevant account indicated in the electronic notification of the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="744">The purchaser of the check stamps is obliged separately in the breakdown for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco to keep a register of check stamps in the electronic system of control stamps.</seg>

<seg id="746">Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the separation of the ELO and the SPD systems of the Department of Excise Taxation of the SR shall be responsible for securing the exchange of information on the basis of a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent authorities of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="747">These include, in particular, requests for screening of entities in the context of the administration of excise duties, requests for information relating to the administration of excise duties, as well as requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications takes place in electronic form under the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following acts are included in administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (application for verification, request for information on excise tax administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEEDs); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; control report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Permission and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In SR, permanent tax supervision is applied to alcohol tax warehouses, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by the continuous supervision of the tax administrator through a tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouse, in Slovakia they are only registered by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="755">In SR, an institute of a registered consignor is introduced, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In the SR, at a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in the case of cultivation burning, it is possible to burn 43 l a.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can only be applied for 30 litres.</seg>
<seg id="758">Growing distillery in Slovakia must be licensed not only by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows growers.</seg>
<seg id="760">In SR, imports of consumer packaging of alcohol are made, in addition to the tax warehouse operator, by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The authorisation of the importer shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax administrator is required to import consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In SR, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is subject to the issuance of a licence from the tax administrator for retailers.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep a register of, among other things, the purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the final seller of consumer packaging alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the Trade Licensing Authority; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In SR, a fuel seller must have a permit from the tax administrator to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">The national legislation in SR does not regulate any special regulation of the petrol station, all activities relating to petrol stations are regulated only in the Excise Tax Act on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In SR, it is technically impossible to get a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In Slovakia, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits fell significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative acts</seg>
<seg id="775">In the SR, substantive legislation provides for the obligation to exercise tax control of selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified by the internal management act issued by the FŘ SR due to the application of the uniform procedure of the tax authorities in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to exercise tax control, the procedural law stipulates only the possibility of carrying out an inspection at the latest by the time limit for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections carried out and local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR determines in what cases and under what time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the accuracy of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 as a result of the increase in the number of transport services in the EMCS system and at the same time as a result of the increase in the number of tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the SR, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of transport services in EMCS and at the same time the decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same amount of administrative tasks.</seg>
<seg id="785">From this it can be concluded that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative tasks by the tax authorities, e.g. the exercise of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, emphasis is placed more on remote surveillance, e.g. tracking devices, immediate sending of data via a web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronization of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be filed via a data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, which, however, can no longer be automatically processed.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must be further transcribed to the taxpayer's personal tax account.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is to limit the error rate of the filed tax returns (DAP), which saves the actions of the tax administrator related to the repair proceedings erroneously filed by the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="793">DGC is working on a new DAP electronic processing application.</seg>
<seg id="794">In addition, through intelligent forms: filing applications for tax or registration for activities and notifications of changes to data, to make refund claims, to comply with reporting obligations when dealing with special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">Loading with control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebKlient information system, which is available to registered entities for the registration of the tax administrator of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products around the Czech Republic under the conditional tax exemption regime must be implemented in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transport of selected products in free tax circulation around the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with proof of their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, by a decision of the customs office to release the selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision to assess excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is determined by law.</seg>
<seg id="799">In order to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the document form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents sent through the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to a data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">JIK is used for the purpose of checking by the customs authorities on the way and prevents repeated transport on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of a fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, CS ČR has on-line access to an electronic registration system into which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for recording and monitoring of the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should use 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-known environment for both declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be linked to a system of global guarantees, to a tax registry or a risk analysis system.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of free circulation traffic between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current process of registering the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen primarily in the abuse of a simplified accompanying document, the reuse of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronization of administrative tasks in SR</seg>
<seg id="810">When administering excise duties, the SR Financial Administration uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under a conditional exemption regime, control stamps, filing tax returns, as well as when registering and registering tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, a one-way electronic communication of tax entities with the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">As part of electronic communication, the tax entity has access to a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is designed for communication with the financial administration, after entering the access data.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic mailroom through which it submits applications, notices, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are mainly value added tax payers, a tax adviser representing a tax entity and lawyers representing a tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">The SAO SR also addressed the issue of the scope of computerisation of excise tax administration during the audit.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communications within the ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">Apart from the transport carried out in EMCS, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">A fully electronized processing of the tax return is already in place in the SR, from filing it to registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, the electronic processing of the tax return is not set up.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities to insert mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation is set up for tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation is being prepared in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">These can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in the Slovak Republic in the area of electronization of tax returns, the SAO recommends the SAO of the SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic to complete the computerization of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes to the organisational structure and staffing in excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">The customs administration of the Czech Republic since 1 January 2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Authorities, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">The DG is an entity for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive excise tax management since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS CR also performs:</seg>
<seg id="838">(a) control:</seg>
<seg id="839">In the field of road transport (weighting of trucks, payment of charges for the use of roads, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">the management of waste and packaging material,</seg>
<seg id="841">The safety of imported food,</seg>
<seg id="842">In the area of consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">The employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">(b) customs management - it is a comprehensive application of customs legislation, commercially policy measures and formalities on the import and export of goods;</seg>
<seg id="845">(c) the collection and enforcement of cash benefits imposed by other public authorities within the framework of a shared administration;</seg>
<seg id="846">(d) the activities of the police authority (referred to customs authorities) in criminal proceedings committed by breaches of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">While the scope of competencies (the exercise of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are savings in costs from the extent, as the public administration does not have to spend expenses on the position of the control group for each subject of control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden of the audited persons is reduced by repeated control.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic continues to exercise the scope to verify the fulfilment of obligations in the record of sales (Section 2(2) of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the Registration of Sales) and, as of 1 January 2017, supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of operation of gambling, including the imposition of sanctions (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">As part of the Modernisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic project, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tier structure into a two-tier structure with effect from 1 January 2013, while the middle article of the management (customs directorates) was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="851">The DGs spent around CZK 51 million on the project. CZK (i.e. approx. 2,031,000 €).</seg>
<seg id="852">CS CR since 1 January 2013 consists of DGCs and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs and their competences are laid down by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="854">The territorial workplaces are the internal organisational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to establish and abolish territorial workplaces and to determine their material scope by decree.</seg>
<seg id="856">Legislation does not provide for any competence for territorial workplaces; the territorial workplace exercises the competence of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure by 31.12.2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure from 1. 1. 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">The administration of excise duties until 31.12.2012 was carried out by the DGC, eight CŘ and 58 departments of the CÚ (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 trade unions and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1 January 2016, the administration of the DG and 51 departments in the CÚ and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight departments of the legal department of the DGC and the CÚ services ensuring mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.</seg>
<seg id="861">The CS CR's costs are most significantly influenced by wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the law on the service of members of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the numbers of these members is only very limited in the Czech Republic, because under the provisions of Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of posts due to organisational changes in the Security Corps is not grounds for dismissal and the employer is obliged to provide members with the allocation of adequate service posts within the corps, or to provide posts with another security force (e.g. The Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will be reassigned to a reserve for temporarily non-attached, in which members of the security forces are entitled under the law to 80% of the average service income.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organisational arrangement of excise tax administration in SR</seg>
<seg id="868">As part of the programme statement for the years 2012 to 2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic set as one of the priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will secure additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, duties and levies and the suppression of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, bringing about the merger of the Slovak Tax Directorate and the SR Customs Directorate into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">The FŘ SR was established as of 1 January 2012 by Act No 333/2011 Z., on the bodies of state administration in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation which is based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">FŘ SR, CÚ and Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Z. z., Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain laws, as amended, are customs authorities if they carry out tasks under customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Act No 333/2011 Z. z., on government bodies in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities, forms the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Financial Operations Centre, the Tax Office, the Tax Office for selected tax entities, branches of tax offices, customs offices, branches of customs offices (CÚ tax branch, branch of CÚ combined, branch of CÚ customs) and customs office stations.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of the FŘ SR is to effectively collect and administer taxes and duties, i.e. also excise taxes, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The president of the financial administration is responsible for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore for the activities of the FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organisational structure of FŘ SR from 1. 1.2012 in abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">Within all customs offices in the territory of the Slovak Republic, the activities and processes in the field of excise duty management ensure, in addition to the branches of customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations), the excise tax departments (9 departments) and the legal department (9 departments).</seg>

<seg id="883">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organisational structure of the SR financial administration, 74 organisational units with a total of 1,300 employees were involved in the management of excise duties in 2015, in addition to the FŘ SR; these departments manage nearly 48,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, in 2015 the administration of excise duties dealt with about 60 organizational units with a total of 1,011 employees, which manage about 114,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of the administration of excise duties is divided between several personally independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their mutual coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the SR, the pursuit of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise tax administration is distributed between the excise tax department and the branch of the customs office, under which the same employees of the tax administrator often deal with that agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In the SR, the number of tax entities is about one-third of the total number of employees in the field of excise tax administration compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the effect of the higher number of employees on the efficiency of excise tax administration is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the establishment of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on transport and to carry out prescribed controls, to simplify the movement of intra-Community goods under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of that EP and Council Decision allows national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and those technical or software which the Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration are included in the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">In the Czech Republic, the so-called customs module and the declarant module were introduced.</seg>
<seg id="901">The tariff module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">Beyond the Community system, in the EMCS system, shipments are monitored in the EMCS system under a conditional tax exemption scheme initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system ensures, after approval, a notification of receipt intended for the authorised recipient for the one-time receipt of the information to the tax registry with subsequent invalidation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from the ELO including sending answers with an attachment in any format and securing translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a report on manual termination of exports in the ECS (only the referral of an automatically created message is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS will not allow the approval of an e-AD or notice of admission without the reaction of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available for tax entities free of charge, it has the form of a web application to which the user logs in with a user name and password (coordinates) that are allocated to him after registration with CS ČR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each action against the EMCS customs module shall be provided with a valid electronic signature in the EMCS Treaty module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declarant module allows tax entities to directly register data on commenced and terminated services under the suspensive exemption regime, so that tax entities do not have to spend funds on the acquisition of the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module make it possible to retrieve and store data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), fill in recipient data based on SEED ID control, and require mandatory completion of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for every shipment sent from the Czech Republic in real time to block the provision of excise duty at the appropriate amount of taxable supply until the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient collateral quantity, it is not possible to send the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA of dispatch from the declarant module EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and contains ARC transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The taxpayer can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS Treaty module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise tax guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the deployment and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight performance contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. 1,761,412.56 €) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. £1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">In the audited period, expenses of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. € 547,438.99) were spent on the EMCS upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on EMCS upgrades in the audited period and converted into one transport injected into EMCS averages CZK 16.49 (i.e. €0.62), excluding national transport, this expenditure per transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States is CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92).</seg>
<seg id="922">The technical support for EMCS was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support of CZK 7,499,6775 (i.e. €281,389,77), including value added tax, had been invoiced.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on a single transport injected into EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">The development and technical support invoices related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which the DGC already operated before EMCS itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">Invoices were paid under programme funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services as well as other applications provided by the supplier for Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in SR</seg>
<seg id="929">EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document - SAD, which was used before the system took effect, thus ensuring better control and traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="931">It has been in place in the SR since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with the requirements of EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">For each transport, a unique reference code is generated, so-called</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which this transport can be tracked online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">EMCS ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods by only such tax entities that are authorised to use EMCS, which greatly reduces the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011 when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the deployment and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of EMCS was implemented as another module of SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine the cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">EMCS's goal was to replace the system based on administration of transport in paper form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefit of the EMCS is a comprehensive overview of transport between individual Member States within the EU from the announcement of the start of transport to its termination, while the reduction in administrative costs for tax administrators and tax entities for the processing, transmission and archiving of documents is significant.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and ensuring a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">There is also a national functionality that monitors the riskiness of the taxpayer or transport, with the subsequent mandatory response of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="946">The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU transport in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, spending in the SR on upgrading this system was €744,310,01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO of the SR received data from the FŘ SR on the upgrade of EMCS only for the period from 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Nevertheless, the expenditure incurred on the EMCS upgrade in the SR was €188,134.44 higher than the expenditure for the deployment and upgrade of EMCS for about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">For the audited period, the volume of expenditure related to the upgrade of EMCS in the SR per transport 2.3 times exceeds the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR met the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel controls, examples of good practice have been identified that could contribute to curbing tax fraud, their importance with rising tax rates will increase.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures have also been identified to reduce the costs of administering excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons when mutually coordinated due diligence is not carried out with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel control of the value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The 1977 Lima Declaration underlines that the highest audit institutions (SAI) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be checked to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Organisation of the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxation to be one of the most important parts of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The VI. EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenue carried out by the SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">A major step towards optimising SAI control activities is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies in particular to taxes as the bulkiest source of public revenue, which is most prone to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAI may be unable to carry out control activities without cooperation with another state's SAI.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the income of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">To combat this offence, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SAI carrying out checks in this area must be willing to engage in closer cooperation with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was at the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea of carrying out an inspection of the Value Added Tax Administration (VAT) and the VIES system in the framework of the cooperation of the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof, arose.</seg>
<seg id="14">Careful preparation followed, with both sides first having to familiarize themselves with the legal environment and procedures for managing VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was carried out which was included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving an effective and efficient VAT administration is a long-standing problem, and individual states (especially the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our control can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the international information exchange system.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject-matter of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Value Added Tax Administration after the Czech Republic joined the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the control action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of value added tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to a value added tax exemption for intracomonity delivery.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intracomonarian value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">System of exchange of information on value added tax Audit actions were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected commercial transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as the "CFN"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period was the period from 1 May 2004 to 31.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">Parallel control in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAI.</seg>
<seg id="34">Outside the main point, exchanges of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the inspection included the legal situation in the area of international bus passenger transport and a comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">Comparing the VAT systems of the two countries found differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) is for registering exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is allocated to payers, which they also use in intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, a VAT number is allocated to payers when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If a German payer intends to carry out intracomonality transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, the international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport taking place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic, payers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany, payers are obliged to file so-called preliminary VAT tax returns (monthly or quarterly) and have to file an annual VAT return at the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic, payers submit recapitulative statements to the tax authorities, in Germany, payers submit recapitulative reports to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="53">The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have data from the recapitulative reports available immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">The German tax authorities have information from the recapitulative reports only after they have been processed at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires updated information on intracomonality transactions to be available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time difference between the date of the transaction and the update of the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would in turn allow for early verification of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">Which, but would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for received requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not track the past time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax administration handled a significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, BRH recommended the German CLO to carry out permanent warnings (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (risk management system, hereinafter referred to as "RMS"), which has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two SAI examined selected cases of intracomonality transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, using the legislation for the CLO, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions have been examined where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicion of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained in the form of international cooperation and assessed the VAT liability of the payers.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers either improperly claimed a VAT exemption claim or did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of the various legal provisions in the two Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases have been found where payers erroneously reported business transactions in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the figures in the VIES were incorrect and tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">The course of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="79">The course of the control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the Department II – the revenue department of the state budget and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited persons were: Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as "MF") and 10 Financial Offices – Financial Office in Humpolec, Financial Office in Jihlava, Financial Office in Kadani, Financial Office in Liberec, Financial Office in Nymburk, Financial Office in Otrokovice, Financial Office for Prague 1, Financial Office for Prague 4 Financial Office in Sokolov and Financial Office in Třinec.</seg>

<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Audit Group on Indirect Taxation and Personnel Designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The audit was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal I.F. in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by BRH and later elected SAO, BRH had to notify a review of a number of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to interviews at the Federal I.F. and CLO, the check was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Included were the tax files of the following tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for Corporations/ Legal Entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hann-Hansa, Hamburg-Hordn-Mitte (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg-Genburg),</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, negotiations were held with the Augsburg-City Financial Office (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old city (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A report on the control findings was submitted to the I.M.F. in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions took place in the period prior to their start.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislative regulation of VAT issues and the VAT management system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the topics of the testing phase were agreed.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">As part of this negotiation, a timetable for the next progress of the work was agreed and the following topics of parallel checks were established:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registration of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus transport of persons - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators in handling requests for information and examining selected problem cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="110">On the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two sides became acquainted with each other with the course of the audit in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of parallel control actions so far.</seg>
<seg id="111">The report on the results of parallel inspections of the VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was drawn up at a working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Tax and Fees (hereinafter referred to as Law No. 337/1992 Coll."), the taxpayer, the tax payer and the legal successor to a natural or legal person defined by law as a tax entity is understood.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">On 1 December 2005, there was an increase in the number of tax entities registered for VAT to 457 590.</seg>
<seg id="118">A taxable person who has its registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a payer from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which it exceeded the registration limit (Section 94(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter referred to as "Law No 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="119">The registration application is required by this person within 15 days of the end of the month in which they exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow a taxable person to be registered so-called retrospectively in cases where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with a right to deduct may become a tax payer, even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), if he fulfils one of the other conditions set out in Act No 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not comply with any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">Delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator initiates registration proceedings under Act No. 337/1992 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="124">The voluntary VAT payer on the VAT registration application shall also indicate the date on which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator shall examine the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the data, he shall invite the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">After verifying that the tax authority fulfils the conditions for registration, the tax authority issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the taxpayer is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Code).</seg>
<seg id="128">On the certificate, the tax administrator shall indicate the date of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT registration period.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335 750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335 750), the tax period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">The payer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax year and will notify the tax administrator of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the VAT number in the registration certificate is always of a constitutive nature and the taxpayer is obliged to state them in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The VAT number contains the code "CZ" and the common part, which is made up of the general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier for a natural person is a birth number, or another general identifier, if a special law so provides, and an identification number for a legal person (Paragraph 33(12) of Act No 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the taxpayer has not complied with its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, it shall be registered immediately by the tax administrator concerned.</seg>
<seg id="137">The registration procedure results in the issue of the Ex officio registration certificate, which is delivered to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that obtained a business license is allocated to the Tax Code at the time of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same VAT is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1 January 2005, the tax administrator may, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, impose on the taxable person compensation of up to 10% of the sum of the proceeds or income for taxable transactions that this person has improperly carried out without tax for the period from the date to which he should have been a registered payer by law until the date on which he or she became a registered payer on the basis of a decision of the tax administrator (Article 98(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax payment (Section 98(3) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">The abolition of registration of the VAT payer subject to compliance with the conditions laid down by law is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Abolition of registration at the request of the payer, mainly in respect of the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (Section 106(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer is entitled to apply for the withdrawal of the registration at the earliest after 1 year of the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Revocation of registration "ex officio" (Section 106(7) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), unless: (a) the payer did not take place without notice of reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer fails to comply with his obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Payers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who performs a transaction with a place of performance in the Czech Republic and is a person liable to declare and pay tax on this transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called "unfounded payer") becomes a payer on the date of this transaction.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the Financial Office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of implementation of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="149">It is required to indicate in the registration application all the TINs allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a "unsettled" payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 registers it retroactively, because under Act No 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">During retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires evidence from tax entities that the performance has been carried out (factures or explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a "unsettled" tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable performance is carried out, then the Financial Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts for the performance to take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 "unsettled" payers were registered at the Financial Office for Prague 1, 2004, of which 124 payers from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005 951 "unsettled" payers were registered, including 233 payers from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of an "unsettled" payer on 31 January of the following calendar year, unless the payer incurred any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SAO's audit found that if a "unsettled" payer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the statutory regulation within the deadline for filing the tax return, the tax office often does not have it available on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant for the possibility of deregistration of registration to the tax office are known later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic in a given calendar year to cancel the VAT registration of the "non-sustodied" payer.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Sections 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, ‘the AO’), anyone carrying out a business activity is obliged to inform the municipal/municipal authority or the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the Municipal/Municipal Office for the Financial Conduct Authority.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the IRS finds out an undertaking that has started but has not registered, the competent tax authority may register that payer ex officio – even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-resident tax residents in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Paragraph 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they make.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">For entrepreneurs permanently living abroad, there are special tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those who have their registered office in the Czech Republic, the relevant Financial Office is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">As the work permits of staff from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Paragraph 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer who determines their working time and the way in which they perform their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">For the purpose of registration, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent tax office in which he must provide information on the company and the activities he carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by services with a general focus responsible for assessing taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form carries out a risk assessment of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the other five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last being always the check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur intends to participate in an intracomonality trade, he or she needs an VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intracomonality supply.</seg>
<seg id="178">CLO assigns a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="179">CLO assigns VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when payers indicate intracomonarian supplies in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of an entrepreneur may be revoked: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business), after carrying out all administrative work (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in a business activity.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the VAT identification number is normally linked to the validity of the VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the abolition of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (Section 19 (1) of the UStG), tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in the case 1. that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2 in the following year is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and have to file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur may declare that he will not apply the provisions of Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This confession is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">An entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For tax non-residents, there is the possibility to appoint a tax representative (Section 22a of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">A prerequisite is that they carry out exclusively tax-exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of the tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who thus does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) is for registering exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the taxpayer does not exceed the specified limit in the Czech Republic, he has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure is standardised in Germany, but as a result of different organisational models in federal states, there may be differences.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is allocated a VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same VAT number in intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, a VAT number is allocated to the payer when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If a German payer intends to carry out intracomonality transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH have discovered, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, as in the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration to intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax office of their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows for a correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Code).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will allocate the Tax Code at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This VAT number will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will apply for an economic VAT number to be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the introduction of the IT device to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus transport of persons</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct.</seg>
<seg id="216">Such carriage is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by taxable entrepreneurs in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return transport is considered to be a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If "unsettled" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activities in addition to international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V. 5(1)(b), which states:</seg>
<seg id="220">‘For the purposes of Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt value added tax on international passenger transport in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or while the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier.’</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of the legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Paragraph 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place where the transport takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore makes no distinction between national and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only that part of the route that takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable provision of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also makes no distinction between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany, then the part of the route that takes place in Germany also represents a taxable provision of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">Before carrying out its services in Germany, the non-resident must notify his intention to provide passenger transport to the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office shall register this non-resident tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notice.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable transport provision in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office registered 741 Czech payers who did business in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">Where the carriage of passengers is provided to a tax resident who is a taxable person for VAT, the non-resident does not have to pay VAT himself to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity required to pay VAT to the tax authority and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is a resident of the recipient of the services; this process is known as the ‘reverse charge’ and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the non-resident tax and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means to assess the accuracy of the declared taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="234">Customs mobile control groups carry out an audit of the certificate of buses authorised (licenses) for foreign transport, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, mobile control groups send a control report to the relevant tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing to carry out further transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident tax may deduct the VAT thus paid on the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the IRS has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit that must be carried out at the Office of the Tax Office or may use the administrative cooperation funds referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if a non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may apply for administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If a VAT return is to be reviewed or the non-resident's obligations are to be carried out, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid as taxable the provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the accounts of the non-resident gives rise to disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration must carry out an audit of foreign accounting, which means not only the need to know a foreign language, but also a familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to take more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport carried out in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident does not only have to accept the right to carry out the control of his national tax administration, but also the right to carry out an audit by other Member States in which he transports passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, in each Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations applicable to it in those Member States, in all languages and on all tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">Actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between individual EU Member States, or between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct tax on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable supply.</seg>
<seg id="251">Where such transport is provided by a non-established payer in Germany for the first time, it is obliged to notify the competent tax authority in advance of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable provision of part of the transport in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">Implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office are in passenger transport business.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the effort, the tax revenue, if it is realized, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT shall be subject to time consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate costs to impose VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">Tax returns for VAT</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to file a VAT return on the form prescribed by the I.M.F. within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if he has not been subject to a tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax liability itself is due within the period for filing the VAT tax return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., for which the tax is determined by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If, as a result of the assessment of excess deduction, a refundable overpayment arises, the payer shall return without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings relating to the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of Section 73(11) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct can be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">At the end of that period, the right to deduct may be further exercised within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct could have been exercised first.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible in the form of filing an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">The amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, allows the filing of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if (a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction that does not change the last known tax liability, but only the data by the tax entity previously claimed, (c) he corrects the rate and the amount of tax according to Section 49 of Act No 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">An additional VAT return is required to be submitted by the payer by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The submission of a VAT return in electronic form can be made both via the Internet network or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submissions over the Internet can be made as a submission with a data message bearing a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of submission with a data message not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature, submission is still required in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer assembly to the tax administrator (e-print).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT tax return contains separate lines concerning the values of intracomonant supplies/equipment.</seg>
<seg id="277">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on the special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated control within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of the supply of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those set out in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through the VIES system from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The tax office is undergoing a test of the credibility of VAT returns under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test takes place automatically, as tax returns for VAT cannot be assessed without a test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test includes the calculation of the credibility criteria and the evaluation of risky types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37(1) of Act No 337/1992 Coll., the Financial Conduct Authority may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 000 (EUR 67,150) within the prescribed period.</seg>
<seg id="285">An automated tax information system used by the FC to provide technical support for tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The SAO's audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for not filing a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (section 18(2) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year or, in the case of a newly established undertaking, the relevant entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day in the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if a tax has been refunded last year which exceeded EUR 6 136 (Art.18(2)a of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns do not need to be filed if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT tax liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund of the tax may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FC.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no deadlines (under the law) for processing tax returns and the refund of excess VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="298">For the purpose of a timely refund, it is possible to offer to secure the amount to be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process VAT returns and return the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act provides for the possibility to extend this period (Section 18(6) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension should be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It makes it possible to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability a month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is found, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct the erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Correction of the annual VAT return to or against the payer is possible during the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payers are obliged to file preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">Financial authorities may apply exemptions from this rule in order to avoid undue harshness.</seg>
<seg id="311">Submission of an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is carried out without certification, the payer must file a return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">In the event that the payer does not file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a gross estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late submission, a penalty payment may be imposed on the payer (maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">BRH found during a previous check that tax authorities often do not measure this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">Therefore, the standard fine does not meet its objective of shortening the average delay, especially when submitting an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT tax return contains separate lines relating to the values of intracomonant supplies/management of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on the special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be recognised on a separate line of tax return/to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns presented in paper form, a copy must be made either by means of a scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data from the VAT returns submitted electronically is immediately available to the IRS employee.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data is entered into the system, the RMS staff will pass them through and make a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The VAT return collected must be checked by a Financial Officer on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration must grossly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, payers file VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax year.</seg>
<seg id="329">The tax period, depending on the payer's turnover, is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, payers file advance VAT returns, depending on the tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">Until 31 May of the following year, payers are required to file annual tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to file an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ on the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the payer corrects the admitted intracomonality transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative statement is made;</seg>
<seg id="335">– the federal states do not usually compare the VIES data on intracomonality acquisitions of German payers prior to the processing of the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German payers are obliged to file an annual VAT return irrespective of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German financial authority to examine the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT return with direct tax returns and the final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are only able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover from the filed income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file VAT returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH") is filed under the provisions of Section 102 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. of the payer who made the supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of goods delivered are always shown in the Czech currency by individual tax entity, indicating their VAT ID, under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on the services provided are not included in SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH is served by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of its completion to the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="348">Correction of erroneous data is made in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the error detection date.</seg>
<seg id="349">The erroneous data referred to in SH shall always be replaced by the data provided in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">Like tax returns, the payers can file SH in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer does not administer SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed them under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator will invite him to submit it and at the same time instructs him about the consequences in the event of the non-submission of SH or the subsequent SH, i.e. the fact that the tax administrator is entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for failing to comply with the obligations of a non-monetary nature.</seg>
<seg id="352">The SAO's audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of the administration of SHs in particular, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations because the non-submission of SH does not affect VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">According to Section 102(5) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to examine the data in SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and use the data to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the event of non-compliance with data in SH and data in the relevant (payers with the monthly tax period) or the relevant (substitutes with a quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of the tax liability declared in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">Incorrect data in SH will be removed by the tax entity by filing a subsequent SH itself, or may be invited to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct the details of the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system where:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the payer does not demonstrate the information given in SH (or subsequent SH), correcting it by administering a subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax authority has demonstrated that the data provided by the payer in SH or the subsequent SH are not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">By entering a correction without filing a subsequent SH by the payer, the tax administrator does not replace the filing of the taxpayer, only adjusting the data in the VIES database so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from SH shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">They can be sent and accepted only by the national authority of the financial administration, designed to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, the International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO) fulfils this function.</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automatic message that the CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all the erroneous VAT ID specified in the SH lines sent.</seg>
<seg id="365">If a faulty VAT ID is used in one of the transmitted common SH or subsequent SH rows, a record is made to the error VAT ID table.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains so-called "Notice of doubt on VAT ID."</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator will examine the data and record the result of the verification into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and state the value of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of goods procured declared by the Czech payer in their VAT return and in the value of the goods delivered, as stated by the payers of other Member States in their SH, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax administrators are obliged to investigate the irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There can be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant lines of VAT return tax returns is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator will check the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">(b) The difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself submits an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether, despite this fact, it will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by the Czech tax payer in the relevant lines of the VAT return tax return is higher than the value of the goods delivered declared to EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here, too, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After examining the difference and clarifying the causes of its creation, the tax administrator shall bring the result of the verification to ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the screening are transmitted back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for verification for individual quarter of 2005 is shown in Graph 1 (source note: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">The above-mentioned Graph 1 demonstrates that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities fell for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant decrease in the number occurred for the 4th quarter of 2005. The CLO has raised the minimum financial limit, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error resulting from the fact that in individual EU Member States some types of transactions can be reported to SH in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of the reported transactions found at the audited tax authorities are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intracomonality deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in tripartite transactions shall be required to lodge once a quarter of the year to the SH, which indicate intracomonality delivery by beneficiary (section 18a(1) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">SH must be submitted by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this period is allowed in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be supplied to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">As of 1 January 2007, they must be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue harshness.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers become aware that erroneous data are provided in SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers do not lodge an SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of such a report.</seg>
<seg id="396">Part of this procedure is: – the first reminder – the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine/penalty, and – the assessment of the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, in amounts of EUR 125, 250 and EUR 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a(1)(5) of the UStG provides that payers act illegally if they deliberately or negligently do not administer the SH properly, submit them incomplete, do not administer them on time or if they do not correct or correct at all late SH.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intracomonality deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the Financial Conduct Authority because the processing of SH is the sole task of CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">The SH data is stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">Therefore, data from SH are visually available only after processing them to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The time limits for the processing of SH are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">The data from SH must be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">In the event of incorrect VAT ID in SH German payers, CLO will receive O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks him for the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case shall be referred to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">BRH discovered during the inspection that most entrepreneurs had corrected the VAT ID at CLO's request.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, the threat and the imposition of three additional fines takes up too much time in cases where the payer can be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The IRS rejected the exemption of reported intracomonality deliveries in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the IRS asked him to file a revised SH on the CLO, as the tax authorities cannot correct the VIES data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the repaired SH, so payers often did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">In view of the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, a comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in SH will not take place prior to the submission of these data by the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This check can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States are processed into the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">The incorrect VAT ID is selected and are then submitted to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">These data are used for the purpose of controlling the acquisition carried out by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, the CLO will check them on the basis of a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created at a later date and presented to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">RMS installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure will then check these data with data on intracomonality acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have made supplies of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall lodge SH within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities will process SH and transmit the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, referred to by the payers in SH, shall be compared at the tax authorities with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State, those payers in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who made intracomonality delivery are required to be served quarterly by the SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SHs are served on CLO, from 1 January 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities have information from SH only after they are processed at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">The payers from both the Czech Republic and Germany list only the supply of goods in SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are unable to correct the wrong lines filed by SH themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited approach to the data of the German VIES system, the erroneous VAT ID was not corrected, even though the payer provided the FCA with the correct VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the data on intracomonality supplies contained in the VAT tax return of the German payer and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of these two statements are usually not found before the German CLO provides VIES data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">In view of the BRH findings, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the transmitted data in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison is made by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are passed on to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the payers' tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracomonarian acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is processed only for payers who do not have full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax authorities control the taxation of intracomonant acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control warning or if the payer is intended to be checked anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Troubleshooting carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intracomonality acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specially VIES, provides information to the financial authorities that can be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if the payers serve SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, as most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to file VAT returns on a monthly basis - and SH does not require any further information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, the submission of SH may be linked to the submission of a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to administer SH per month would cause more time disagreements between the reporting of intracomonality delivery and intracomonality acquisition and could increase the flow of data between individual CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the German federal government considered the general provision of monthly SHs.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed because of the doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that the monthly submission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the monthly reporting obligation to SH and monthly data transfer were to be effective, the monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SHs.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">Within the framework of foreign trade, Germany represents the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intracomonial transactions in goods made between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT number or VAT ID, contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data shows substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States regarding intracomonality trading transactions and payers who have made such transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information upon request is carried out in the form of a so-called request for information (hereinafter referred to as the "ŽOI"), using standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI, respectively replies to delivered ŽOI through the financial directorates to CLO, which provides translation of the information given on standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also ensures the income of ŽOI from other Member States and replies to the dispatched ŽOI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the locally competent tax administrators for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum time limit for processing a range of 3 months from receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO's control was subjected to all ŽOI, transmitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the total number of 94 ŽOI, received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the prescribed three-month period, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were dealt with after this deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany by the time of the SAO's audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information about the deadlines in which responses to the ŽOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic contains Figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the total number of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the specified three-month period, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of the applications were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) had not been received by the time of the SAO's examination (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the transmitted data when the response from Germany was delivered).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information about the deadlines in which the responses to the ŽOI sent to Germany were delivered to the Czech Republic contains Figure 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage of the values of intracomonant transactions, presented in the ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany, contains graph No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the above graph, the value of commercial transactions, examined through ŽOI, was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information, or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax managers from other Member States are often transferred without prior request information that may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">‘Automatic exchange’ under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structified by automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available for the tax administrator from the form of the Report on the delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing the aforementioned form, the tax administrator shall complete the necessary data into a specially created template and transmit it in turn to the contact worker at the Financial Directorate, where the data are collected and transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States within a specified period of time, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which this information was available.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales that is exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU operations that appears to be unjustified and information on potential "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is sent to other Member States in the form of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of international information exchange in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed form SCAC 2004 by email directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent in order to ensure taxation of intracomonality acquisitions in another Member State, or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">Where there is no reasonable grounds for such request, the German CLO shall reject any application containing an amount lower than that fixed limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to answer the request for information, the CLO sends the request to the competent tax authority, pointing to the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no additional deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to reply to blank requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only relate to one business operation that has recently been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible audit type does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has demonstrated its usefulness in the investigation of individual taxable business operations.</seg>
<seg id="505">As part of an automatic exchange without prior application, Germany provides information to other Member States - on the VAT ID allocated to payers resident in other Member States - on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has committed itself to providing other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, b. sending or catalogue sale in other Member States that is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intracomonality acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intracomonality delivery of goods which the German payer did not show in SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "missing trader" which carried out intracomonarian transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "writing traders" or to those recipients who misused their VAT.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The dispatch of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the locally competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the SCAC bilingual form (English - English) and translates the sent information into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the instruction according to which they are to write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a single-language form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide for the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">By examining the ŽOI transmitted between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had handled 74.5% of the applications received within the prescribed three-month period, while the ŽOI sent to Germany was processed by the German tax administration within the deadline of only 40.6% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO draws the attention of the tax authorities to a three-month deadline, it does not follow the past time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of the missing notifications is a large number of delayed responses to the HOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Because of these problems, BRH recommended conducting regular notifications to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information from the German CLO, it is now alerting the tax authorities to answer unfinished responses to the HOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">Risk management in the area of VAT</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, VAT risk management is dealt with by several departments at various organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="521">Under the I.M.F., risk management issues and the fight against VAT fraud are dealt with by the following services:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and the Performance of VAT and within it the VAT Risk Management report, which, among other things, manages the risk selection of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at both domestic and Community levels.</seg>
<seg id="523">It coordinates nationwide the functioning of the role of the credibility of VAT tax returns and the use of data from the VIES system in terms of risks of tax evasion in the context of intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, processes conceptually risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates with relevant EU institutions and other Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="525">The International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT, which inter alia ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT number or VAT ID, contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data shows substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Tax Control and Search Methodology Department, which among other things carries out risk analysis under the methodological management of tax controls and, in line with the risk analysis, sets priorities for targeting tax controls in the plans of the Financial Directorate, processes risk analyses in the context of reducing tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge gained in tax management as well as other sources, and proposes measures to curb tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Search departments are set up in financial directorates to carry out, among other things, searches for tax entities and areas that are risky in terms of the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches for unregistered tax entities in terms of risks of tax evasion (e.g. internet services, job mediation, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of links of chain fraud and the transfer of information to local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">A specialised control unit is set up at the selected 12 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence, tax controls outside the territorial jurisdiction of the tax authorities are carried out on the basis of a mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to establish a department of specialised tax inspections has emerged from the increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur primarily in chain-linked entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and large-scale tax entities in terms of turnover size.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms to limit VAT risks have been integrated into the ADIS system: – the role The credibility of VAT tax returns, used to assess the riskiness of the tax returns filed; – the role The selection of tax entities for control, which allows the payer to be selected for inspection on the basis of the chosen criteria, – the role of VIES through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES allows, inter alia: – to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, – to generate a set of payers who did not do SH, – to carry out a formal check of the data provided by the payers of the Czech Republic before sending these data to other Member States, – to generate a set of payers for which the data on the supply of goods to other Member States mentioned in the VAT returns do not match the data in SH, – to generate a set of payers for which the value of the goods from other Member States mentioned in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of the activity to limit the risks of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to registers of government bodies such as a business register, land register, motor vehicle register, trade licensing register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information is provided in chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (especially the CLO) and the tax administration of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of federal states share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the CLO level, the ST I 2 unit (KUSS) collects the findings of the control relating to tax fraud in a separate database called the OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">The KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed to transfer the names of tax fraudsters' companies "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="546">The KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">KUSS experience is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, specialists in several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with RMS-related duties and powers.</seg>
<seg id="549">At CLO level, a formal check is in place for the composition of the VAT ID of other Member States in SH submitted by German payers.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out prior to the provision of data from SH to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The verification of the validity of the VAT ID referred to in SH is made on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the invalid VAT ID correction procedure, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO RMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually feature in so-called carousel commercial operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="553">The financial authorities of the federal states have instructions to process these inspection reports and in some cases report on the results of their CLO findings.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed the need to take into account all the characteristics available if the existence of a tax fraud case is to be presumed with sufficient probability (place of exclusive focus on the company's turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">BRH therefore proposed to the I.M.F. to take into account different characteristics when processing the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">RMS should also sanction other facts, such as the payment behaviour (morality) of the taxpayer, the field (economic activities) or the shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and aimed at processing VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">RMS, for example, generates a list of those payers who have declared intracomonality delivery in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to CLO to monitor the full use of SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares the intracomonality acquisition, reported in the payer's annual VAT return, with the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder seek to avoid comparing quarterly data, as this comparison would reveal too much disapproving data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">– a different period of implementation of the intracomonality transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">– Different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (bids) and their different reporting in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing data from VAT and VIES tax returns, many federal states have introduced elements of RMS, which are based on the data of VAT returns and certain other facts (such as the structure of the company's name, the age of shareholders, the number of employees and the payment behaviour/or morality of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a rule-based RMS that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program its own rules for singling out potential perpetrators of tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">The competent tax authority will therefore receive the recommendation created by RMS before setting the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this RMS is unable to translate current findings into its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The administrative district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on these data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">RMS creates a once-a-month list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The competent tax authorities use this list as a basis for audit decisions proposed by taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, auditors must report on their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The administrative region of North Rhine-Westphalia uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data assessed for VAT returns and certain other facts, this neural-fusion system or system of collecting potentially useful information (the so-called data-mining system) calculates the likelihood that a taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of potential perpetrators of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="577">Local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for inspection and report the findings of the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of one of these three RMSs in the other Länder is further ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for dealing with tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – does not prove to be a national problem, but rather a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in multiple states.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not affect a Member State instigator of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State that is involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be a European exchange and debate on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">As part of the cooperation on the implementation of parallel control actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information about selected business transactions that were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">Furthermore, the two audit institutions jointly examined the implementation of several commercial transactions where there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way in which the payers from both countries declared these commercial transactions in their VAT and SH tax returns respectively.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">Furthermore, in 43 cases, the SAO examined the values of intracomonant transactions with Germany on the basis of warnings from BRH, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH.</seg>
<seg id="597">BRH examined a total of 23 cases at the request of the SAO relating to commercial transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">By examining selected cases, it was found, among other things, that a different method of registration in EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer was to acquire in the third quarter of 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.</seg>
<seg id="602">As the Czech payer ordered the acquisition of the goods only at a value equivalent to EUR 29 869, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to Germany to examine the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In response to the ŽOI delivered from Germany, the German side stated that in the second quarter of 2004 the German payer had supplied the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 27 381, in the third quarter of EUR 31 997 and in the fourth quarter of 2004 worth EUR 10 276.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply further showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been in force since 28 September 2004, but the German CLO retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate from 1 May 2004 following an additional request from the German payer for the VAT ID certificate.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer repaired SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">The Czech payer, based on this information, was the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech payer, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT when acquiring goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT tax returns, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine whether the supply values from the aforementioned German supplier were also included.</seg>
<seg id="609">BRH, based on the SAO's request, found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID when registering, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible to allocate VAT ID to the payer retroactively in Germany, in this case the German tax official assigned the aforementioned German VAT ID payer retroactively as of 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause a delay in the assignment; for example, if the delay was caused by CLO after the payer's VAT ID application.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracomonality supplies under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare intracomonality acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these different procedures between Member States, the German CLO assigned a VAT ID retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Czech tax administrator asked for information on the verification of the registration of the German VAT payer as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES indicated the date of registration of 5.3.2005, with the date of 1.10.2004 on the registration certificate of the German payer issued by the locally competent German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a reply delivered from Germany, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1 October 2004, but VAT ID was granted to him in Germany for organisational reasons only on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator, found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a VAT check on the Czech payer for the tax period of the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">With this check, the tax authority found that the Czech payer included in the VAT tax return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German payer in the period prior to its VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax year III quarter of 2004, the tax office assessed the tax entity's VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">BRH, at the request of the SAO, found that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when he informed the tax office about his business, which he started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office registered it retrospectively for VAT on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer reported intracomonality acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported a supply of goods worth CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) to a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after the delivery of goods by a Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer filed an additional DAP for VAT, in which he reported the tax base on transactions carried out in the Czech Republic worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3 642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO's inquiry with the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer subsequently filed a request for a retrial in respect of an additional VAT return and as evidence submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from Germany showed that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that this case was not an intracomonality acquisition of goods, as the German payer obtained the VAT ID until 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German beneficiary ordered the acquisition as an intracomonality acquisition and declared VAT on that acquisition when it claimed a refund of input tax at the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, since there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH further found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in a mix-up of two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that this administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, during which he verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and the Czech payer had booked and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intracomonality transactions only from 21.4.2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the registration certificate to the German payer so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Financial Conduct Authority assessed the transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany, and therefore did not additionally measure the tax on the Czech payer from that commercial transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States did not have to have a VAT ID allocated to an intracomonality supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have a VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">Under the German VAT Act, it was therefore an intracomonality transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to ŽOI relating to intracomonarian transactions worth less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to VIES data in the third quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to acquire goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax inspection with the tax entity for this tax year.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax administration to verify the supply of these goods through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and the acquisition of these goods was not accounted for in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the requirement to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents on the ground that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory justification was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence to obtain the tax on the acquired goods, he terminated the tax inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">BRH, based on the SAO's request, found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (Sections 22 a – e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer reported those deliveries in his annual VAT return and in SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">Entitlement to the exemption of delivery was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on warnings from BRH, the German tax office will send documents needed to the Czech Republic to collect the tax on acquired goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As mentioned in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO's audit found that the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information to Germany on 5.10.2005 concerning the examination of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer reported a supply of goods to a Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in SH for this period, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT tax return the acquisition of goods only at a value equivalent to EUR 35 314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on September 9, 2006, i.e. after the deadline for processing, provided for in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the application could not have been processed because the operation of the German firm was terminated at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">By failing to meet the deadline for processing the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents needed for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German payer, carried out in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that a response had not been received from the FRG until the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO further found by asking the locally competent tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT tax return the supply of new means of transport for the German payer worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375 472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">BRH, following a request from the SAO, found that the German CLO had not, for technical reasons, hand over the aforementioned ŽOI to the locally competent tax authority for verification.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following warnings from BRH, a check was carried out in Germany by the German acquirer, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the respective cars had been sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">The purchase of these goods was not acknowledged by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">Tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after the tax administrator's calls, so the tax office sentenced him to VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005 the CLO drew attention to the aforementioned supply from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the ŽOI to Germany concerning the aforementioned supply.</seg>
<seg id="677">As the response to the ŽOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO's audit how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tax office revoked the Czech payer's VAT registration on 23 August 2005 due to non-compliance with VAT obligations.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the ROI, as the audit carried out by the tax authorities at the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH inspection:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to the German payer, made in the third quarter of 2004, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In response to the ŽOI, the German tax administrator stated that he had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for supplies worth EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">BRH, following the SAO's request, found that the control carried out by the German tax office with the acquirer from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer ordered the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of cars to a German payer worth 198 167 euro, carried out in the fourth quarter of 2004 and I. quarter 2005, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial response to the ŽOI to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that several local investigations were carried out at the Czech supplier by the locally competent tax authority to verify the drawdown of excess VAT deductions, in which it did not detect their unauthorised use.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer had, in that period, in its VAT tax returns, ordered the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 and that the control carried out by the German tax office from the acquirer of Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intracomonality acquisition values indicated by the recipient in the tax return and the values indicated by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">Checked cases showed that the most common reasons for differences were not the time shift or indication of the incorrect value of the intracomonality delivery of goods in SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">The Czech payer was to acquire EUR 35 716 worth of goods from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005, according to data from the VIES system, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activity at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax administrator asked as part of the international exchange of information to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The answer to the ŽOI delivered from Germany showed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity is unknown at the communicated address and that the goods were taken over by the agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only supplied the goods worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of the payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After discovering the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic, found that the tax administrator, on the basis of the information obtained, assessed the Czech VAT payer for the acquisition of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">BRH, based on the SAO's request, confirmed that the German supplier had ordered the supply of goods to the Czech payer only worth EUR 7 9116 after repairs.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the repaired value of the goods and a decrease in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Which included his SHs the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested, via the SCAC form, to verify the supply of goods and services made in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods totalling EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation into the Czech payer for the purpose of examining this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator said that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line, including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">Individual parts of the production line were supplied by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic joined the EU and after 1 May 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer took the issued invoices but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO further found by asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that all invoices are duly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="713">VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 include only amounts that have been substantiated by the Czech payer and relating to invoicing after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that based on a response from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction involved the supply of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including the assembly services.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this special case, the place of so-called performance of the work is where the production line was installed.</seg>
<seg id="716">Under the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the service supplied is obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the beneficiary can claim the deduction of VAT on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections to the VAT tax return were neglected by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to VIES data, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent an application to Germany to examine this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the ŽOI, the German side said that the machine had already been supplied by the German payer C to the Czech payer B in 2004, which, however, was to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, a reply to a request for information showed that the German payer C had sold the machine to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Because the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracomonant delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO, asking the tax administrator of the locally competent payer B, found that according to VIES data, the German payer C supplied the Czech B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 0227 in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Payer B denied this acquisition of the goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the ŽOI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the reply to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">Another investigation by the payer B found that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the accounts of the payer B, and that it could be a machine of the same type as was delivered by the German payer C's organisational unit to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator of the locally competent payer A carried out a local investigation with this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had at his disposal the invoice of the German payer C of 7.2.2005, on which the payer A was listed as a purchaser of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that the payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Payet A had a lease agreement with another Czech company, where the lease was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9.2.2, the transport of the machine was carried out by a leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech Tax Office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C had not supplied the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer, D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intracomonant supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognise the German VAT exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D supplied the machine to the Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C gave in his SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not examined by the German tax authorities during the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above-mentioned business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">When inspecting the ŽOI received, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had received a request from Germany on 4.10.2005 from Germany asking the German tax administrator to verify the intracomonality delivery from a German payer worth 879 680 625 euro to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this was a feigned intracomonarian supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">It was further stated at the ŽOI that the German payer had not carried out any active commercial activities since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the statement of the manager of the Czech company, in the above case it appeared to be a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax administration, which was claimed by the Czech payer as a partner of the German company to the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator has no information until now that the German tax administration has dealt with the issue related to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, yet the stated value is still included in the VIES system as an intracomonality delivery of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not report intracomonality acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to VIES data, the German payer supplied the Czech payer with a total value of EUR 33 205 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator asked for verification of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to this request, the German tax administration said that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods were collected personally by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="757">By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that even before receiving a response to the ŽOI, the Czech payer filed additional VAT returns for those periods.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, differences in acquisition values have not been resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended carrying out a tax inspection with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The inspection has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to VIES figures in the third quarter of 2004, the German payer delivered goods worth €46,854.</seg>
<seg id="761">Over the same period, the Czech payer granted an intracomonality acquisition only equivalent to EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator asked for verification in the framework of the international exchange of information the value of the deliveries made.</seg>
<seg id="763">The reply to the ŽOI, received from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods 31 999 euro, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="764">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that after receiving a response from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech payer and agreed with it that after examining these invoices with the owner of the company, he would discuss filing an additional VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would proceed in such a way as to meet the set deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">The German payer was to deliver €11,600 worth of goods to the Czech payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="769">The German tax administrator asked for confirmation as part of an international exchange of information about whether the Czech payer actually existed, because an alleged partner of the German payer founded more fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">When examining the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were further sold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer presented documents for the sale of goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not grant or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts suggested tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in response to the ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech payer, on the basis of the investigations carried out, filed an additional VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of the acquisition of goods, among other things, from the German payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct the tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT on the sale of goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after the local investigation was carried out unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, this case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator therefore incorrectly concluded the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax administrator had corrected the German payer's tax return immediately after receiving a reply to the ROI stating that the goods had not left Germany, had corrected the German payer's tax return and demanded VAT of EUR 1 600 from him.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent tax authority has sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, the payers reported intracomonality transactions that were unlikely to actually take place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The application was accompanied by a copy of the Czech VAT registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="786">In addition, a copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, had carried out the transport of that car was accompanied.</seg>
<seg id="787">An investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that it was a stolen passport, the person in it did not bring any vehicle to the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was provided by the Czech tax administrator in response to the ŽOI along with the statement that it could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">The SAO's inquiry with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not resettled at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company's manager was uncontactable.</seg>
<seg id="791">After the execution of the complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax year, the Czech tax administrator imposed a tax liability of CZK 0 on the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="792">Another investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question was sold to another Czech entity, which bought it through an advertisement on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the locally competent German tax administrator, on the basis of the Czech response to the ŽOI, would not recognise the German taxpayer's right to exempt that supply from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the audit, the German tax authority was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3,000 between the value of the goods acquired in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was reported that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth €89,4224 to the German payer during the fourth quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator asked for verification of deliveries and their remuneration in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax administrator said in a reply to the ŽOI that the sole manager of the Czech company was removed from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new manager was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to a partner of Czech society.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed tax returns for both VAT and SH, which was signed by an unauthorized person - the company's partner, after deleting the manager from the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The Czech payer's accountant confirmed to the tax administrator that the company's partner had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash papers were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic, when asked by the locally competent tax authority, found that the tax administrator had recognised the Czech taxpayer for the fourth quarter of 2004 entitlement to an exemption from VAT on the supply of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 422,145) and for the 1st quarter of 2005 in the amount of CZK 1,416,180.</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany had not repaired the German acquirer's VAT return because the German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the earlier check revealed no signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to enforce the tax liability imposed.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to data in VIES, in 2005 the German payer acquired goods worth EUR 4 251 196 from the Czech Republic after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In the 2004 tax return and in the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not report an intracomonality acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="807">Furthermore, it did not show adequate supplies either.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these differences, the German tax office sent the ROI, relating to the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported an intracomonality delivery of goods to a German payer totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5 615,299) in SH for these two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the ŽOI was delivered, in which the German side asked to check whether the Czech payer of reported intracomonarian supplies had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration said that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no manager.</seg>
<seg id="812">As is apparent from the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax authority, on 30 March 2006 a report was drawn up with the managing director of the Czech payer for the start of the VAT inspection for the fourth quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the payer was asked by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the abovementioned periods, but did not provide any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the only manager of the Czech payer ceased to function on 16.5.2006, a new agent was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech payer has stopped filing VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the SAO's audit in cooperation with BRH, among other things, it examined several cases of intracomonality deliveries made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases examined was transmitted by the two highest audit institutions through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. The Czech company (eCR), which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005, but has not received a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms on behalf of, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to a lack of its own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows contractual relations and how wind farms are transported:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of execution of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– A Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind farms for assembly under his name, his risk and his account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">As the assembly of that supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the shipment began, in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This delivery is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– Delivery of those wind power plants that are manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The supply of other wind farms produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intracomonality delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracomonarian delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intracomonality acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany or injected SH to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company has reported all intracomonality deliveries uniformly as an intracomonality delivery from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (eCR) showed no intracomonality delivery to Austria, but intracomonality delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">Examination of the taxation of intracomonality acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no indication of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the SAO and BRH examined transactions to highlight the differences between the reporting in the tax return and the VIES data caused by the different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">Controlled cases also demonstrate that changes in the legislation need time to apply new legislation to practice by both payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In SH for the second to IV quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported an intracomonality delivery to a German payer with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25 197 885).</seg>
<seg id="841">Over the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intracomonality delivery to another German payer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970.</seg>
<seg id="842">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers listed the above mentioned supplies in SH in accordance with the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">By further examining the above transactions, the SAO-controlling group found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the statutory regulation of the supply or acquisition of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intracommunity supply of goods, in terms of the German legal regulation in force in 2004 it was not an intracomonality acquisition, but a taxable performance with the place of implementation of the fulfilment in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in statutory regulations in the Czech Republic was eliminated by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. Furthermore, when examining selected intracomonant transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported an intracomonial delivery to the German payer in the 1st to 4th quarter of 2005 with a total value of 240 411 163 CZK (EUR 871 823) and another Czech payer reported intracomonial delivery to the German payer for the same period with a total value of 263 470 776 CZK (EUR 846 050).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, in the case of electricity supply, the place where the acquirer has its registered office, place of business or where it has an establishment for which the goods are delivered.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have introduced electricity supplies to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">By showing the intracomonality of electricity supply in SH by the two above payers, the VIES data was distorted by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation met the objectives of BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAI received a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">Cooperation has revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that VAT management legislation differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">During parallel checks, suspicious cases of intracomonarian transactions were found.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to subsequently check.</seg>
<seg id="858">Based on the control findings, both SAIs developed recommendations on VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="859">Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration controls.</seg>
<seg id="861">Communications</seg>
<seg id="862">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the President of the Bundesrechnungshof, the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in controls on excise duty management between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The joint report submitted informs about the course and outcome of international cooperation during parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on the administration of excise duties in the period after the two countries joined the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel checks was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties, which took place in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow non-taxable goods to circulate until the date of its final consumption delivery.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on the tax authorities and foresees close interaction between the competent administrations of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in controls on excise duty management for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of control: (Czech Republic) Administration of excise duties (SR) Procedure of colné organs in sprays of spotreb taxes</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO-ČR) and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the SR) concluded on 8 February 2006 the "Contract of Cooperation in Control Activities".</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation during parallel checks carried out by the "Interim Tax Administration", included in the auditing plan of the SAO-ČR for 2005 under No 05/34, and "Control of the procedure of colné organs in sprays of spotrebné taxes", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR for 2006 under No 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel checks were in the nature of coordinated control.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information that the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the administration of excise duties on the territory of their State and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of controls within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of INTOSAI Audit Standards - Directive 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Czech Republic, the control (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) was carried out by groups inspecting the state budget department and from the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia between 7 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">The inspection involved 27 controllers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs (hereinafter referred to as the CD) and 11 tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Within the DGC, 12 selected customs offices out of a total of 54.</seg>
<seg id="22">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SR") was carried out by the Section of the Financial and Tax Office of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 between 13 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">The inspection involved 8 controllers.</seg>
<seg id="24">The aim of the parallel checks was to examine the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">International cooperation was focused on the procedure of tax administrators in the exercise of supervision of the transport of goods subject to excise duties, in particular the registration of initiated and completed traffic under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise tax administrators of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="26">2. Management of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="27">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by the financial authorities until 31 December 2003.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken over by the customs authorities, which have so far levied excise duty only on importation.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="30">The state budget's revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic amounted to a total of CZK 82.8 billion in 2004 and 19.5% of the state budget's revenues from taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the share of state budget revenues from taxes and fees amounting to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2004, the income from excise duty on mineral oils to the State budget was 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it was 90.9%.</seg>
<seg id="33">The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of all excise duties in the SR shall be exercised by the customs authorities from 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, which they have been administering since 1 January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">Until then, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="36">Excise duty in the SR is subject to mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="37">The revenue of the state budget from excise duties in the SR totalled 43.4 billion Sk in 2004 and in total tax revenues of 209.5 billion Sk, excise duties accounted for 20.7%.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties was 50 billion Sk and total tax revenues of 222.6 billion Sk accounted for 22.5%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Graph 1 — Comparison of revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic from taxes and fees and tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic with revenues from excise duties</seg>

<seg id="41">The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No. 353/2003 Coll., on Excise Taxes, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as "Law No. 353/2003 Coll.").</seg>
<seg id="42">When administering excise duties in the SR, customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding legislation: - Act No 98/2004 Z. z. o spotrebne oil tax in the knowledge of non-corporate predtoy (hereinafter referred to as Law No 98/2004 Z. z., - Act No 104/2004 Z. z. z. o spotrebalé tax on wine in the denial of non-corporate predpisov (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 104/2004 Z. z."), - Act No. 105/2004 Z.</seg>
<seg id="43">2.1 Movement of excise goods under a suspensive tax exemption scheme between Member States of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="44">The conditions for the movement of excise goods under the suspension exemption procedure are governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods from Article 15 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="45">Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be carried out only by an authorised warehousekeeper, which means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="46">A consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of an authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not, under a suspensive exemption scheme, store or dispatch them further.</seg>
<seg id="47">The authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovakia means the operator of a tax warehouse, the economic operator is the beneficiary for the repeated or one-off acceptance of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="48">Under Directive 92/12/EEC, the transport of excise products subject to excise duty is only possible with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document shall be issued by the consignor before the commencement of the service in four copies, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch request a further copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure for the start and termination of the transport of goods under the conditional exemption procedure between the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="51">Transport from the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="52">The procedure for the commencement of transport is governed by the provisions of Section 25(3) of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="53">‘The operator of the tax warehouse shall, before commencing the transport of the selected products, inform the customs office which is the place competent for the tax warehouse from which transport is to be commenced;</seg>
<seg id="54">transport of selected products can only be initiated with the consent of this customs office.</seg>
<seg id="55">The customs office shall give its consent to the transport of the selected products without delay after the condition of securing the tax is met ..."</seg>

<seg id="73">In the transport of other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) during the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘controlled period’), the taxpayer was under no obligation to notify the Customs Office of Poprad or the competent customs office of the commencement of services under the suspensive regime.</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax administrator only became aware of the transport of these products during a local investigation or during a tax inspection from the accompanying documents and from the tax entity's accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="75">The consignor in SR is obliged to prepare an accompanying document in four copies before the start of the transport.</seg>

<seg id="89">2.3 Records of operations initiated and terminated by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="90">In order to monitor the transport of goods under a conditional exemption regime between Member States of the European Union, a single electronic system is not in place.</seg>
<seg id="91">Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the establishment of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty requires Member States and the European Commission to establish an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) from 1 July 2009 allowing excise tax administrations in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the carriage of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the conditional exemption regime and to ensuring a more effective control of the movement of untaxed products across all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">This system will include national databases for each Member State's transport.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport initiated and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Evidence of selected products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have access to the system online.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of transport carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, tax authorities may obtain information about the start or end of the service immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office to EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the security of the tax on the transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration by the customs office of the competent beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs authorities in the SR use a database based on SysNed's application software, which ensures the automation of their activities in the management of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorised recipient in SysNed's application software, this figure is automatically transferred to the "System for Exchange of Excise Data" database (SEED).</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO-ČR and representatives of the SAO SR, at which the specific cooperation procedure for the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties was discussed, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">The two sides became acquainted with the legislation on excise duties and the organisation of excise tax administrations in both states.</seg>
<seg id="103">Particular attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR in authorising or in the initiation and termination of the transport of products subject to excise duty under the conditional exemption regime and the exchange of information between excise tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides would: - process the total data on the quantities of products subject to excise duty transported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started in the audited period, - compare the data on mineral oil transport - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - the Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the conditional exemption scheme initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the inspections, the periods examined were extended by the months of October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under the suspensive exemption scheme was also subject to scrutiny in these months.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty which were carried under the suspensive tax exemption scheme between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of registrations of goods under suspension of tax</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO-ČR handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport terminated in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO handed over to the Czech side a database of transport terminated in Slovakia, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 related to mineral oil, 2 066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO-ČR compared the data on the traffic listed in the register of initiated traffic in the Czech Republic with data on completed traffic registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are presented in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on transport in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which the SAO handed over to him at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data allowing reliable transport to be agreed and therefore only 63% of the commenced services were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual services were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. the consignor, the recipient, the date of transport, the quantity of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on traffic initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to the accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the commenced services were clearly assigned.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The amount of alcohol was in most cases mentioned in litres, which, however, could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of that percentage alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="118">The amount of tobacco products was shown in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms depending on the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">For traffic initiated in the Czech Republic, the termination of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or where the information about the transported quantity of products was not met, the accompanying documents were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">The control was subjected to accompanying documents for 487 transport of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="121">The examination of these documents was carried out at the customs offices at which the SAO-ČR carried out checks.</seg>
<seg id="122">For services authorised by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested through the DGC.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 traffic, for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not substantiate the confirmed copy No 3 of the accompanying document, or did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">Furthermore, data on the services registered in the Slovak database were handed over to the Slovak side, which, however, did not contain the database of transport of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR found 95 traffic in the Slovak Customs Administration database.</seg>
<seg id="126">The verification of the remaining 46 services was requested by the locally competent customs authorities, who proved their termination with copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transport carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of initiated traffic.</seg>
<seg id="128">A check of these cases was found to be:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 transport of alcohol was registered in the Slovak transport database in the total amount of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transport of alcohol in a total amount of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-ČR found that it was a transport of taxed products, the start of which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The freight forwarder informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of the service. He carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 transport of mineral oils, Combined Nomenclature code 2710 11 21, totalling 173 thousand litres realized by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005 were registered in the Slovak transport database.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-ČR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out transport of 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without proper authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax entity held a special authorisation for the receipt and use of products exempt, on the basis of which it could supply untaxed products only to the holder of the same authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="135">He did not notify the opening of the transport authority in the Czech Republic and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1,207,680.</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax entity delivered 71,000 litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of the SR. Even in these cases, he did not comply with the legal obligation by not announcing the opening of the transport office to the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="137">The transport of products put into free tax circulation on the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the consignor in the Czech Republic without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the commencement of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="138">A tax entity taking products put into free tax circulation in another Member State is obliged to report quantities and ensure tax before they are withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="139">Products may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also accepts the use of the accompanying transport document under the suspensive exemption scheme, which must, however, clearly indicate that it is a ‘simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax control (excise products)’.</seg>
<seg id="141">The same rules on transport and acceptance of products put into free tax circulation in another Member State also apply in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="142">In those cases, the tax authorities transported the products put into free tax circulation with the accompanying transport document under the suspensive exemption scheme, the 3rd and 4th copy of which the recipient submitted to the tax administrator in the SR for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in the SR registered these services in the transport database under the suspensive exemption scheme, as the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the database of transport of the Czech customs administration with the database of transport of the Slovak customs administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases the quantity of products transported was reported inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it more difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the amount of alcohol transported in the invoices did not coincide with the amount recorded in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices listed in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- two transport of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were registered in the database of the Slovak customs administration carried out in November 2004 in a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol, which were not in the database of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="151">The conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for excise duty management were governed by 30 June 2005 by Council Directive 77/799/EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004, which lays down rules and procedures allowing the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties, entered into force.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office which shall ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise duty management and is responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, for securing the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union, a paper was set up at the DGC "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as "ELO ČR").</seg>
<seg id="155">The safeguarding of tasks related to the management of systems for the control of the movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information under mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the SR were carried out with effect from 1 May 2004 by the ELO at the Customs Office of Poprad.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of the ELO Office (based in Poprad) of the Excise Taxation Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (ELO SR) fulfil the tasks of the ELO.</seg>
<seg id="157">Pursuant to the provisions of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible, inter alia, for - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of the movement of excise goods sent to or received by the Movement Verification System (MVS).</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and MVS are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - a system for the exchange of information on tax entities trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system is made up of national registers of excise payers and allows tax administrations in the territory of the European Union to determine whether products subject to excise duty are traded by a person entitled to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information stored in that database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z. z., § 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z. z., § 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. z. and with § 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised beneficiaries and tax warehouses - SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">The customs authorities in the SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, an authorised recipient or a tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, they automatically transfer the related data to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO of the SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the customs administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">SR Customs accepted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">The data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transferred from the national register, in which all persons authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorizations to deal with these products are registered.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Applications by customs authorities to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">A risk consignment is considered to be, on the one hand, the transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission Regulation and, on the other hand, to transport assessed as risky by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is realized in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - is sent when the limits are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- alert message - is sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="176">When assessing the level of risk of an ELO SR consignment, it uses the SEED database to send a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the event that the SEED database does not agree with the data in the accompanying document (for example, it does not match the registration number of the recipient of the goods or the registered office of the consignee), the ELO SR shall draw up a warning report sent to the ELO of the Member State of the recipient of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">In drawing up the reports, the ELO follows the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which determine, among other things, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measurement for the preparation of explanatory and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the audited period of ELO SR, the ELO sent one warning message to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information about started transport of products in quantities exceeding set limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving transport.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it will prepare a so-called warning message, which it will send through the ELO ČR to the relevant Member State.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005, the ELO CR sent two warning messages to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The MVS - the system for controlling the movement of goods - makes it possible, through MVS requests, to control individual transport services of products subject to excise duty as well as the control of a specified route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information shall take place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system shall be used in particular in cases where the consignor takes receipt of the confirmed copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requires, for example, the refund of excise duty and in cases where the data contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period ELO SR sent 33 MVS applications to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO ČR sent ELO SR 25 MVS applications.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often examined the data contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantities of products received or dispatched or whether the consignor of the products listed in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of the products subject to excise duty, unless this fact could be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="189">The accepted MVS applications were forwarded in both countries to the customs offices locally competent for the recipients or consignors of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="190">The customs authorities examined the required data and reported the outcome of the investigation through the ELO to the other member country.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the SAO-ČR and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in initiating and terminating the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between the two states, the registration of these services and further compare the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Compared to the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">(a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrations in initiating the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme can only be initiated by the taxpayer in the Czech Republic with the consent of the tax administrator, who authorises the commencement of transport on condition that the transported products were provided with a tax security equal to the tax attributable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The start of the transport of products under the suspension exemption scheme in the SR is not subject to the authorisation of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="197">In the audited period, the taxpayer was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">He was able to commence the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the conditional exemption procedure is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office, which is the locally competent consignor;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The beneficiary in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification at the latest on the following working day after the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">The verified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor no later than the following working day after receiving it from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in SR is obliged to send the consignor of the products copy No 3 confirmed by the tax authority and the recipient of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping this register is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="206">Customs authorities in both countries shall enter into the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">In order to monitor the transport of goods under a conditional tax exemption regime between Member States of the European Union, there is currently no single electronic system that allows excise tax administrations in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the carriage of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Pursuant to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, an electronic system for monitoring the transport of products subject to excise duty is foreseen from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of the cooperation agreement in the control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared the data on the traffic listed in the register of initiated traffic in the Czech Republic with the registration of traffic terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared the data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">The comparison of the data was made more difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not stated uniformly in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute the data on individual transports in the two registers, the accompanying documents was checked and the breach of the suspensive exemption scheme and cases of tax evasion were not found.</seg>
<seg id="217">Based on the findings of parallel checks, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the register of transport to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council shall allow electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under the conditional exemption regime within the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of the follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes generally represent a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is therefore self-evident that the supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should concentrate their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Examples include value added tax fraud (VAT).</seg>
<seg id="7">For their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (EU).</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005, the participants of the VI Congress of EUROSAI in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As part of this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also the SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, as well as theBRH) carried out the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As fraudulent VAT negotiations are not limited to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between the SAI is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the actions taken to address the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAI therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a subsequent parallel control.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the audit was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the VAT administration, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany") and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit action was proposed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were intended to compare with the proven practice found (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008, in case of factual context as well as the preceding and following periods, until the end of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">The subsequent inspection of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">During previous parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intracomonarian transactions were detected.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further screening.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the control findings, the two SAI formulated a VAT administration recommendation.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up control action carried out was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also focused, for example, on selected cases of high-risk intracomonality transactions, mutual assistance in debt recovery and the implementation of VAT controls for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When checking the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors reached the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from previous control</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel checks, the comparison of VAT registration systems in both countries identified differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different types of registration cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation was made at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003) called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="38">He also adjusted common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAI expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of that document, agreed by EU Member States under ECOFIN, does not already contain the issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAI regret notes that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to see this intention as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against fraudulent VAT practices.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="44">As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements, allowing for a more timely examination of the values of intracomonality transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion limits to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, implemented in Germany from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit recapitulative statements was not introduced monthly within the deadline, in accordance with the EU regulations in force, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAI agreed that an effective risk management system could not be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraudulent activity will be chosen by the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The check found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system, which allows the exchange of information within the EU, while BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected cases of intracomonality transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">In the course of the previous audit, commercial transactions were jointly examined for which there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or recapitulative statements by the tax payer from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAI selected nine cases for subsequent inspection, which included the intracomonality movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">Checks by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not concluded at the date of completion of our previous joint control operation.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent inspection operation verified that most of the tax proceedings in connection with the mentioned selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany had been closed and that adequate measures had been taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT collection or the avoidance of input tax refund).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Checking selected cases of risky intracomonant transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High risk cases of intracomonality transactions carried out by EU payers that have been included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky tax payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The participation of Member States in this system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the scheme if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">Given the fact that the German tax authorities were not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the audit, the SAO found both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrators have limited opportunities to control risky transactions, especially as regards so-called missing traders, and mere physical examination of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent conduct to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation for tax administrations occurs when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracomonity carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in the transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movements within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively engage in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risky tax payers, which until now have worked well for the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, experience between EU Member States needs to be communicated and exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU has reached political agreement on the draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation lies in the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in the use of EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new network to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH have compiled a comparison of the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs consider useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the SAI agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission, on the basis of more detailed statistics, to produce an analysis to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates so that they can increase the recovery rate to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter also "VDS") in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected, in the form of a questionnaire, information from tax authorities on areas considered essential by the SAI to manage this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The responses received clearly show that the situation in both countries is developing differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system to guide the selection of cases prone to risk, relying on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax inspections carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">The establishment of a specialised tax office for the management of the VDS is planned in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is no similar system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">So far, Germany has focused more on the choice of individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of VAT return data and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of these data is based on the different risk management components that will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. The course of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 The course of the control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Department II - the Department of State Budget Revenue and the Territorial Unions IX. Plzen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial offices (hereinafter also "FÚ"): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ v Břeclav, FÚ v Domažlice, FÚ v Hodonín, FÚ v Hradec Králové, FÚ v Chebu, FÚ v Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ v Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ v Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ in Písku, FÚ in Písku, FÚ</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion of this audit was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Progress of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Audit Service for Indirect Taxation and Personnel Designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, a control event took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">Included were the tax files of the following tax authorities: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, negotiations were held with the tax authorities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions to discuss and determine the control topics took place in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="113">Subsequently, in December 2008, the top officials of both SAI signed a cooperation agreement in the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the inspection teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on December 2 - 4, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The control teams exchanged hitherto accumulated findings together and agreed a timetable for drawing up a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAI decided to focus on: • follow-up checks on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • examining selected cases of intracomonality transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not solved during the previous parallel control, • examining selected cases of intracomonant transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • control of the process of tax administrations in the area of international VAT recovery assistance, • tax controls of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel control actions was drawn up during the June 2010 working meeting.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous control</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended the modification of the VAT registration conditions and the introduction of a new rule for the abolition of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Adjusted conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion on VAT collection.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that the tax authorities in some cases did not use the authorisation to revoke the VAT registration on payers who did not comply with the obligations arising from Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter the VAT Act).</seg>
<seg id="127">An amendment to the provision consisting in introducing an obligation for tax authorities to abolish VAT registration for VAT payers on repeated non-submission of VAT returns has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the tax payer ‘ex offo’ in cases where: (a) the payer did not perform without notice of reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer fails to comply with his obligations under this Act; (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous inspection, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the FC for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers, who were not obliged to declare and pay the tax during the normal calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FC for Prague 1 has often not abolished VAT registration for these payers, as the relevant provision has set an insufficient deadline for the deregistration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was removed by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established tax payer if the taxpayer did not supply any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with a right to deduct VAT in the preceding calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of recapitulative reports</seg>
<seg id="135">As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive shortens the periods for which recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to submit recapitulative statements in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">A summary report must be made to the payer even if the services in respect of which the place of performance is determined pursuant to Paragraph 9(1) of the VAT Act are made available to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State and if he is obliged to declare and pay the tax of the recipient of those services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration compares data on intracomonality transactions reported in VAT returns and recapitulative reports of Czech payers automated in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper VAT collection is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore among the areas of priority interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is evidenced, among other things, by the findings of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to determine the difference between a legitimate and actually collected amount of VAT in the 25 EU Member States (EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of VAT loss for the period was between €90 and €113 billion, with an average of 12% of legitimate VAT not levied annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the context of international cooperation, the previous control action stated that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system used to exchange information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">For the inspection, cases of risky intracomonality transactions carried out by EU tax payers, included in the EUROCANET system have been selected (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of responsible authorities in a form enabling fraud to be detected in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later become an important source of information in assessing risks for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812 while setting out the basic principles governing the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The preview of EUROFISC is an already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report provided the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system for registering tax payers, which is based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance alerted the Commission to this system in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improvement of the system is carried out continuously.</seg>
<seg id="166">Currently, data from the questionnaire are processed electronically and will then be used for exploration as part of risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission has presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to safeguard the level of standards already reached in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of recapitulative reports</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law was adopted on the transposition of EU directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="173">This Act contains provisions on the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intracomonant supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative reports to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group was set up, made up of workers from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy has so far been discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the Task Force dealt with a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a party to this exchange under the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and, following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">Platform members are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influence negotiations, • evaluation, • updates to the Risk Management Guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">In early 2010, reports on the results of these subgroups were published.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the cancellation of such registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="191">He also adjusted common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="192">For the time being, the issue of registration and the cancellation of registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on that draft regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and only have an obligation to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee about these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAI regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome the Commission to make further efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of recapitulative reports</seg>
<seg id="201">As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements, allowing for a more timely examination of intracomonal transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion limits to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, and took effect in Germany on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit summary reports monthly according to the set calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU (see cap. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this area, BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected cases of intracomonality transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In the previous audit, the implementation of commercial transactions for which there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way in which payers from both countries declared these commercial transactions in their VAT or recapitulative statements were jointly examined.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected nine cases for follow-up, including the intracomonality movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the control of which carried out by the tax administrations of both countries was not completed during the previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech payer acquired goods worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of the goods was not awarded by the Czech payer in his VAT return because the German payer did not have a VAT ID allocated during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States did not have to have a VAT ID allocated to the intracomonality supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="219">Subsequent inspection by the SAO found that, on the basis of an inspection carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT return in which he admitted the acquisition of the goods at that value and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT in the same amount in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">The Czech payer was to acquire €12,561 worth of goods from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not state in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax authorities refused to cooperate at the request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence, he terminated the check without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had received two spontaneous information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced those goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer acquired the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in a proper VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">The Czech payer was to acquire a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods in question did not award the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax administrator assessed the VAT amount of CZK 0 for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the payer to file an additional VAT return but not submitted to the payer.</seg>
<seg id="232">Subsequent inspection found that the tax administrator carried out further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the passenger car in question had sold the Czech payer to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax year by which he additionally assessed VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and its subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was abolished with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of the execution of the liable assets of the tax debtor, this arrears appear to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was to deliver new means of transport (personal cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">The reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that there was an unfinished tax-criminal procedure against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">Upon subsequent inspection, BRH obtained information that after the conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was demonstrably established that the German tax payer had been integrated into fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intracomonarian acquisitions of goods were taxed at EUR 182 424 (in 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO's follow-up inspection found that the Czech payer was involved in carousel trades with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration regarding the examination of the supply of goods, a VAT check was initiated at the Czech taxpayer for the tax years April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the control findings and information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the May 2005 period of CZK 703 031 and for the June 2005 period of CZK 726 551.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth a total of EUR 58 000 from a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was to deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="247">Subsequent SAO inspection found that the payer B acquired the machine from a German company that had established an organizational unit in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer A did not show the acquisition of goods from a German payer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The reply from the German tax administrator to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intracomonial delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but the delivery of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">BRH's subsequent inspection found that after the tax inspection carried out, the intracomonality delivery of the machine was reclassified as the supply of the machine in the Czech Republic and the VAT exemption was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German tax payer was to deliver €11,600 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO's follow-up found that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods of that value, was improperly stated.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the VAT return on the German payer and additionally charged VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The aggregate report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, as corrections to recapitulative statements in Germany can only be carried out by the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 whether the Czech tax payer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">The Czech tax administrator, after a tax procedure carried out for the February 2005 tax year, imposed a tax liability on the Czech taxpayer in the amount of CZK 0 and told the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car by a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">Subsequent SAO inspection found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was abolished in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administrator sent documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">Subsequent inspection by BRH found that the German payer had changed his seat and the new locally competent tax administrator had revoked the VAT exemption for the supply of the car to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German tax payer has not yet corrected the figures in the recapitulative statement and filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to data from the VIES system, the German payer supplied the Czech taxpayer with a total value of EUR 33 205 between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">Subsequent SAO audit found that the Czech tax administrator was attempting to determine the causes of the differences arising from the Czech tax payer in the purchase of goods between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the acquired goods in the amount of 134 273 CZK for the period 3rd quarter 2004 to Q1 2005, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for individual quarters and therefore the tax administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German tax payer delivered €46,854 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">Over the same period, the Czech payer admitted the intracomonality acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods EUR 31 998, a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data contained in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Subsequent SAO audit found that the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return for the tax year July 2004 to January 2007 after many of the tax administrator's claims.</seg>
<seg id="275">In that tax return, the taxpayer also exercised the right to deduct VAT, thereby remaining unchanged the tax liability for that tax period.</seg>
<seg id="276">The follow-up verified that for selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax proceedings were completed and that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany had taken an adequate measure (i.e. they additionally assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intracomonality transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of the control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information for the detection of risky entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting on 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic is sending data to EUROCANET on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="282">As part of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for control.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">EUROCANET recorded relevant data from tax authorities from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="285">As the German tax authorities did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information to help determine whether suppliers with German VAT ID had been assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The inspection revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where applicable, the tax authorities used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicion of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities shall continuously monitor such tax entities due to their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax and VAT base in the submitted accounting, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed commercial relationships with suspected or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated, as some tax payers did not cooperate with tax administrators and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">Locally competent tax authorities have mostly examined risky tax entities and risky transactions listed in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax administrators in examining risky transactions, particularly in relation to the examination of so-called missing traders , have limited options and only from physical examination of documents makes it difficult to prove fraudulent conduct to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter requirements for VAT registration and more flexible registration cancellations would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered in order to report fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to payers who improperly draw deductions of input VAT on their basis.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other frauds and the import and export of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in the transport documentation, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that the work of EUROCANET was not attended by three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of this system, which should be removed by setting up the EUROFISC mandatory network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 The results of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">These figures were the criterion for collecting the six files of the German tax payers for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is merely the recipient of the EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The rationale for this position is contained in the following statement: according to the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis that would make it possible to violate the provisions in force on the secrecy of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such EUROCANET data is used by other Member States."17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of data from EUROCANET and shall proceed with the Länder's tax authorities in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">German tax authorities receive control information on the direct trade relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain business with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal large differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">Tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the EU has reached a political consensus on a draft regulation, the main contribution of which lies in the establishment of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="318">The envisaged network to combat VAT fraud should also include the experience gained in the use of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases brought before courts at national and European level show that discussions between Member States and the Commission on the terms of tax exemptions in intracomonality transactions seem necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The basic regulation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is in particular the following directives:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the system of financing of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from transactions forming part of the system of financing of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive No. 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on International Assistance in the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this directive into Czech law and at the same time to amend the mentioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No.119/2004 Coll., on International Assistance in the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">The new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annex to the Regulation sets out new templates of applications that apply from 1 January 2009, a new obligation for electronic communications and an obligation for the requesting authority to certify the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Guiding principles for the provision of international cooperation in the recovery of claims:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance shall only be granted on the basis of an application containing the prescribed requirements;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. the assistance shall not apply to financial claims which are in the nature of criminal penalties in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. the provision of international assistance in the recovery of claims shall be followed by the domestic legal order of the State that has been requested for assistance;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims do not take precedence in recovery;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance is granted only in the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State, without success, used all applicable possibilities to recover the claim given by its legal order).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines the three forms by which assistance is carried out, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending claims for debt recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The competent tax authority shall electronically send a request for information, a request for service or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance will provide translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it, including annexes, and send it through the CCN/CSI network to the competent tax authority of the designated state.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two basic requirements for enforcement: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and must not be more than 5 years old.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receipt of claims recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">Upon receipt of a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the application as soon as possible within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection of the request and specifying the specific provisions of the directive it relies on.</seg>
<seg id="349">This communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application has all the formalities according to the law and should immediately forward the application through the Financial Directorate to the locally competent tax authority for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator ascertains, among other things, the debtor's assets, e.g. by acquiring land registry statements, by ascertaining accounts in banks, by verifying vehicle registration at the DMV, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">After a period of six months from the date on which the receipt of the application was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should communicate to the applicant authority the outcome of the investigation carried out in order to obtain the required information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities where it is not possible to recover the claim, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="354">Each amount recovered from the tax authority shall be transferred to the requesting authority within CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not impossible for the Czech tax administrator enforcing foreign claims to allow a wait to pay it or pay it in instalments if the state that requested enforcement agrees to do so.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the period of recovery, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments under Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty payment belongs to the State that requested enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of applications for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for processing to the locally competent tax authorities in a timely manner, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the context of international debt recovery assistance in the case of applications received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The inspection operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No 191/2004 Coll., because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State about the progress made in recovery within six months from the date when the receipt of the application was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with the provisions of Section 13(4) of Act No 191/2004 Coll., the Czech Ministry of Finance processes statistical data for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery, sent or received in the past year, specifying the amount of claims to which the applications relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the evidence provided from all EU Member States, the European Commission is preparing a report on the state of recovery, submitted to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the receivables item in 2008 by EUR 5 250 thousand, by indicating the incorrect value of the claimed VAT claim (this was a shift of the decimal point after converting the claim from Czech crowns to the value in euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error subsequently translated into the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Mutual assistance information, including the amounts recovered, is provided in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International debt recovery assistance in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal authorisation for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from the law of the European Communities, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Directive on debt recovery) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In the interests of more accessible formulation and better clarity, the EC Directive on the recovery of claims codifies Council Directive No 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the Law (EC) on the collection of State taxes of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German fiscal code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities that are valid in national jurisdiction and under the EC Administrative Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part of the Sixth German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) enshrines the statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative acts of the tax authorities are governed in particular by enforcement instructions and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder (Länder) on the principles of administrative assistance in tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general prerequisites for filing claims for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic means of recovery have already been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• Claims that are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.</seg>
<seg id="382">• From the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. it is no longer the subject of an appeal), no more than 5 years must elapse by the date of submission of applications.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending claims for debt recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the relevant foreign authority, for example the Czech CLO, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">The closer procedure is governed by the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (recovery of claims) of 19 January 2004.25 The working group of the Federal Government and the Land Government is currently reviewing this methodological guideline to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The request, including annexes, shall be submitted by the Financial Conduct Authority electronically to the intermediate authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">This office shall check the accuracy of the application in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the application is not correct, it shall be returned to the relevant tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it fulfils all the formalities, it shall be referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority and also ensure the translation of the application.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receipt of claims recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Claims for the recovery of claims received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and shall send a certificate of receipt within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check that formal requirements have been met.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office shall submit these applications to the intermediate authority, which shall then proceed with the relevant tax authorities and monitor their handling.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">Where an application takes more than 6 months to process, the intermediary office shall invite the competent authority to submit a preliminary report which must be made pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">Following an inspection of the formal and factual elements of the application, the implementing services shall notify the method of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account referred to in the application within one month of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) is contained in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Recovery control, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">As part of international cooperation, 21 requests for international debt recovery assistance were selected for inspection between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="404">Examination of the ten selected cases found, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany to recover the VAT claim for the years 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, i.e. CZK 109 820, for the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the tax administrator an application for recovery only on 26 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">As it was not even possible to pay the entire recovered claim by stopping the properties, a payment plan with instalments of min. CZK 2,000 per month was agreed with the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, information on the state of recovery was sent to the German tax authorities, with the claim being partially recovered on 25 August 2009 in instalments amounting to CZK 49 600.</seg>
<seg id="411">This amount was sent to Germany and on 28 August 2009 a further instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application to recover the tax arrears of the Czech tax entity, which owed EUR 180 869 in Germany, i.e. CZK 4 434 915, to VAT and income tax and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the tax administrator only on 27 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">By checking account ownership of banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, the tax administrator found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Furthermore, a local investigation found that the debtor had not been staying at his permanent address for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This Communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany for recovery in respect of tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech taxpayer in the amount of EUR 3 139, i.e. CZK 84 846.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax administrator on 6.8.2008, although already on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that the application for recovery was settled by the payment of a claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also paid in the context of enforcement in the Czech Republic and remitted to Germany on 27.10.2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time limits in which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorized tax administrator, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and the recovery of the claim by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against the claim from a further recovery application amounting to EUR 6 649, which was to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance records only an application for recovery of a claim of EUR 3 139 for this company, the request for recovery of a claim of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance at the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany to recover the tax arrears of the Czech tax entity, which owed EUR 39 957 in Germany in income tax and VAT and accessories, i.e. CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated, an execution was ordered to order a claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and a deduction from wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7,000).</seg>
<seg id="431">At the hearing with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it to be questionable.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax administrator found that the tax entity had been willing to repay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="433">The tax entity promised to discuss the application with the German tax administrator in order to obtain a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">Recovery of the claim continued during the SAO's audit.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery application from Germany concerning the Czech tax entity, which owed in income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories a total of EUR 113 444, i.e. CZK 3 116 304.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent an application to the FÚ for Prague 1, which is entrusted with the administration of the tax on non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, as it was not possible to determine the locally competent tax administrator on the basis of the said address of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="438">In the investigation carried out, the FC obtained information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FC could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance only forwarded the request for recovery of the claim after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated the recovery of the claim and issued an enforcement order to order a claim on the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.</seg>
<seg id="440">Recovery of the claim continued during the SAO's audit.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax administrator applied for international cooperation in recovering the VAT claim and costs totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3 October 2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for enforcement to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the German tax administrator transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Federal Bank, the amount obtained from the execution of funds in the debtor's account of EUR 17 700, i.e. CZK 439,226.</seg>
<seg id="445">When verifying the amount of claims recovered, an error was found in the conversion of the amount recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount recovered CZK 146 223 742 was converted at EUR 1 = 25,065 CZK erroneously to EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct conversion of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781.83.</seg>
<seg id="448">A claim for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover the tax arrears from the Czech tax entity, which owed CZK 1 970 632 for VAT and accessories, i.e. EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration only on 10 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4. 2. 2009, the German tax administrator asked the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant declines in the company's turnover in the 2nd half of 2008 and in particular in the 1st half of 2009 and the associated liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: on 8.4.2009, EUR 4 600, on 6.5.2009, EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009 EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the German tax authority agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">The application for recovery of the claim totalling EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including the claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for enforcement to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified the repayment on the ground that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or point (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax authorities further stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims relating to income tax and property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and property taxes listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with paragraph 4 of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to draw up and submit a new application for recovery, excluding the arrears of real estate transfer tax in the amount of CZK 61,759 and stating VAT arrears, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be again sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new application by the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of tax arrears relating to the same tax entity, which owes CZK 7 079 735 in income and VAT tax.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of the tax arrears of the Czech taxpayer, which owed in personal income tax and VAT amounting to CZK 3 445 782, i.e. EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of this amount, the VAT amounted to CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration only on 18 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the German tax administration's response from the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007 to 11 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax administrator had issued an execution order for a bank account with the bank on 11 June 2007, which, however, stated that it had no commercial relations with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">By doing so, the German tax administration considered the application to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, i.e. EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The application from the Czech tax administrator was received from the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">On 15 December 2005, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for enforcement, the Czech tax administrator carried out an execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and a deduction from wages and established a lien on immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authority on 16.3.2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">The reply to a request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005 showed that the Czech tax entity was staying in Germany and had an income of EUR 8 437 from the non-business activity.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20. 4. 2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax administrator only on 12.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The reply stated that no enforcement proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the insolvency of the debtor - no assets were found on him and his non-business income was already subject to other enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="481">In doing so, the German tax administration considered the application for enforcement to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and BRH have compiled a comparison of the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.</seg>
<seg id="487">In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay particular attention to keeping their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of non-compliance in the statistics had decreased even though the number of applications had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important that the issues of statistics are renegotiated at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU states in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the two SAIs agree that reliable statistics are intended to show an annual number of applications as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amounts of claims recovered by individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States, as this may help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that it is possible to calculate the rate of recovery of claims broken down into individual Member States is considered by both SAIs to be useful for Member States with a lower recovery rate to intensify their efforts and to try to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for debt recovery to the locally competent tax authorities on time.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found in applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The inspection operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No.119/2004 Coll., on international debt recovery assistance, because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months of the date when the receipt of the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for checking VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or set up for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax year specified in the personal/legal income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="504">The inclusion of the taxpayer among the VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time for 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">The taxpayer ceased to be referred to as the VDS if, in three consecutive tax years, from the end of the period on which he filed the tax return on the basis of which he was included in the VDS, his net turnover for the tax year fell below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">The taxpayer was not allowed to be removed from the VDS register without carrying out a tax audit of at least one tax per tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS had been checked in at least five years of periodicity until the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">From 2010 a written evaluation of the taxpayer must be carried out at least every 2 years and the chosen follow-up must eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The audit of the FC is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator generally chooses several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The VDS was audited by departments of specialised controls, which are set up in a total of 13 FCs, or by the staff of the control departments of locally competent FCs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The Department of Specialised Controls carries out tax inspections within the scope set by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• Tax entities operating in unusual and specific fields of business;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities where carrying out tax control is technically and time-consuming;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with a sprawling territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unauthorised avoidance of excess deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax checks carried out by the departments of the FCA and the results of these checks are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists of establishing a dedicated FC with a nationwide competence for selected tax entities (i.a. for legal entities established for business purposes, which achieved a turnover of more than 2 billion CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT controls for large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • the German fiscal code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Controls (BpO) regulations.</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax On-the-spot checks. In particular, those articles enshrine the rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot tax control (i.e. at the premises of the undertaking), their scope in terms of subject-matter, rules on the division of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of control, the obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and the preconditions for the implementation of the final consultation and the communication of the inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Administration Act According to Article 5.1, point 1, in connection with Article 19 of the Act, participation in tax controls on the spot by the tax authorities is mandatory for the Federal Central Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The participating authorities shall agree on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it collects are subject to scrutiny at the time it determines.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case, it may declare rules for the implementation and content of the inspection at the premises of these companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Tax control regulations According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were agreed by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, in which the governments of the Länder are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative rules apply to on-the-spot checks carried out by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Businesses shall be classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to follow-up (Article 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Under Article 33.1 BpO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration sets out the following guidelines:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Single manual for special VAT checks in Germany ;</seg>
<seg id="539">• the USLO Manual, which sets out a methodology for the use of data on intracomonant trade relations conducted in VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">• ZAUBER manual setting out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to control - not just large businesses - must be set at regular check intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">As a general rule, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually declared including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that during the course of the inspection, checks will be definitively carried out primarily on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangements of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by controls is usually between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 foresee a three-year control period.</seg>
<seg id="553">The subject of the screening is all the taxes of the company.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAI decided not to examine individual cases of VDS controls carried out, but focused on management issues to get an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT controls at VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax administrations about the areas they consider essential for the management of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses relating to VAT control of VDS have at its disposal to the management of tax administrations?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records of rates in which there is a distinction between the fight against VAT fraud and, more generally, VAT control?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system at the current data version does not allow such a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT controls (in relation to the time period of transactions checked)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Registration of timeliness of questioning with relevance to intracomonality acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers is reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, data such as how long it took to inquire are part of the information recorded in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average recent check (information on the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the latest period of tax assessment; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the statistics produced at the Federal level for the units of special VAT controls do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• There are some statistics or records of the nature of the additional tax revenue generated, broken down, for example, according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer improperly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. the transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of the additional tax assessed by the type of tax, the number of tax entities audited and the number of tax years checked.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigations, complaint procedure) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">As a separate task, time figures and amounts of additional taxes are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics of general debts broken down by type of tax are also kept, but not according to the declared tax or tax determined by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for the units of special VAT checks do not distinguish between the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Moreover, these differences are not distinguished by the majority of tax administrations visited.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are control areas registered that generate high additional returns?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect the tax payer for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in the special ADIS sections.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">It then follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for specialised VAT control services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">Nevertheless, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down an obligation imposed by them on the increased tax (VAT) basis if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the assessed increase in tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS exercise an unjustified right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used to carry out any economic activity under Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which have been used for representation pursuant to Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73(1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not declare output VAT under Section 21(1) of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It was said that there were no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It then follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for specialised VAT control services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">VAT findings are not separately registered by the Länder if they result from VDS tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down their assessed increased tax (VAT) obligation if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of the areas of control from which there is a high "return" and draws the consequences for the management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT control services do not provide data on audit areas that generate high "revenue".</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the analysis process, as well as on the management of cases in terms of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but their use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects the amount of data from the tax inspections carried out, as well as data from financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to channel the selection of cases prone to risk.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same is true of the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">It follows, then, that it is more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on the choice of individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAI agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenues.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the return on VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will also improve.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two SAI on parallel checks of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">The two SAI have better recognised each other's applicable systems in the following areas: • intracomonality transactions, • VAT risk management, particularly in terms of risk collection of transactions, • assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT control for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies as well as differences in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and proven practices were identified on the basis of them.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">Extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communications</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in the Czech, English and German languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and by the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="626">Ediency deadline: June 2010.</seg>
