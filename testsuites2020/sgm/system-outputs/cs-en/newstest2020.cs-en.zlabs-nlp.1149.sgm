<seg id="6">The introduction of the VIES system enabled electronic exchange of information on the registration of the value added tax payers in individual Member States of the European Union and commercial transactions carried out by these payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the data in the VIES system and the tax return data for the value added taxpayer should notify the tax administrator on suspicious cases and allow the discovery of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit carried out by parallel audits consisted not only of exchange of information on financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but especially in verification of the use of the VIES system during the inspection of the claim for exemption from value added tax during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained in the implementation of parallel inspections is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of other parallel inspections in cooperation with the audit institutions of the European Union Member States.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel control of value added tax administration for the period from 1. 5. 2004 until 30. 6. 2005</seg>

<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information in the extent specified by the concluded contract and in the elaboration of the joint final report on the outcome of parallel inspections.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated audit was to verify selected cases of delivery and purchase of goods at suspicious commercial transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “ČR”) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as “SR”).</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties are contractually committed to providing information from public sources, from the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to verify business transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were carried out in parallel from June to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the state budget department and territorial trade unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, Financial Office in Cologne, Financial Office in Teplice, Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, Financial Office in Tábor, Financial Office Brno III, Financial Office in Znojmo, Financial Office in Zlín, Financial Office in Šumperk, Financial Office Ostrava I, Financial Office for Prague 7 and Financial Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The auditing operation on the territory of the Slovak Republic was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO in cooperation with Expozitrami NKÚ SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: Tax head Bratislava I, Tax Úrad Komárno, Tax Trade Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Office Zvolen, Tax Office Dolný Kubín, Tax Office Košice II, Tax Office Košice V and Tax Office Michalovce.</seg>
<seg id="25">Target of controls:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel auditing events was to examine the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as “VAT”) after the inclusion of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”) and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, especially when controlling the claim for exemption from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited period of the coordinated control was from 1. 5. 2004 until 30. 6. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions In EU Member States, an electronic system VIES is introduced, which allows tax administrators to check whether the supplier was entitled to free taxable performance from VAT, and in the country of destination it allows to verify whether the acquired goods acquired properly confessed and taxed.</seg>
<seg id="29">The VIES system is not centralized within the EU, each Member State develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit was found differences of national systems of VIES in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">In summary reports, the delivery values of goods to other EU Member States are stated, the values of the services provided are not stated in the aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from aggregate reports submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of financial authorities, where they are compared with data on delivery of goods to other EU Member States listed in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">Financial authorities transmit data from aggregate reports to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which is sent to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Slovakia, data from aggregate reports submitted by Slovak tax authorities are only transferred to electronic form and processed centrally on the Slovak Tax Directorate (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, the payers show the value of delivery of goods and the value of the provision of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of tax returns, which allows to compare the values referred to in aggregate reports with the values of delivery of goods according to tax returns and identify their possible differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Slovakia, the values of the delivered goods and services provided to other EU Member States are reported collectively on the common line of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, the system does not allow the system to automatically identify the differences between the values of the delivery of goods according to tax returns and aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the values of delivery of goods in VAT tax returns allows you to use the results of the comparison of data when checking the exemption of deliveries to the EU from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="39">The specified data from the aggregate reports submitted to the payers in other EU Member States are processed on CLO and compared to the value of the purchase of goods stated by the payer from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Slovakia, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax administrators themselves decide which cases will verify the differences.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which quantified the differences between delivery values and the purchase of goods, shall be determined by the tax administrator, and the relevant tax authorities shall give a list of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that the most important deviations will be verified whether VAT was awarded in the correct amount when purchasing goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">The auditing operation also pointed out some problems in the VAT administration system complications caused by different reporting of intra-community transactions (i.e. delivery and purchase of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">The summary reports are served in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum period for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set for 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">The shortening of the period for which the aggregate reports are administered, one month, together with the shortening of the deadline for their processing, would allow earlier access to the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="46">The tax administrators could thus effectively examine whether VAT was awarded in the correct amount during intra-Community purchases.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the administration of tax returns and aggregate reports for the same taxation period (month) would allow faster verification whether the payer reported on the total report and tax return of the same value of delivery of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="48">The differences between the values of the delivery of goods reported by payers from the EU and the values of the acquisition of goods reported by payers from the Czech Republic, or Slovakia were caused by a different reporting of data on intra-Community delivery and acquisition in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These include, for example, the introduction of received advances in aggregate reports, or reporting intra-Community deliveries in a summary report of the supplier in a different quarter than intra-Community acquisition in the VAT tax return of the supplier.</seg>
<seg id="50">The unification of the conditions for reporting this data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activities of the tax administrators of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also focused on verifying selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, where there were doubts about their implementation, virtually suspicion of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO, found the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities reported in their tax returns for the purpose of unauthorized acquisition of an excessive VAT deduction realization of intra-Community transactions, whose implementation did not actually occur;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax entities showed intra-Community delivery within the carousel shops, in which several times the value of deliveries in the purpose of drawing excessive VAT deductions occurred;</seg>
<seg id="56">Suppliers reported VAT and aggregate reports of intra-Community delivery of goods exempt from VAT to buyers who were so-called “lost companies” and tax on acquired goods did not admit;</seg>
<seg id="57">suppliers carried out intra-Community delivery of goods exempt from VAT for tax entities that were not registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In these cases, the delivery of VAT should not be exempt and should be subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">Suppliers reported intra-Community delivery in a higher value in their tax returns than in which they reported intra-communary acquisition makers, and in some cases VAT was awarded in the wrong amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">From the knowledge obtained in the control event, the VIES system provides tax administrators with information necessary to check the correct application of VAT during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">The tax administrators should pay increased attention especially to the consistent verification of the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES system and the use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>

<seg id="173">The tax entity provides additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">The SAO has found a question with the local tax office that the Slovak payer incorrectly stated the provision of the service in the summary report and will be tax check for 1st to 4. quarter of 2004.</seg>

<seg id="181">According to data from the VIES system, this entity had to acquire this entity from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4. quarter 2004 goods worth 7 846 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the realization of these trades, the Czech tax administrator sent two applications to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="183">The SAO of the Slovak Republic found out that the Managing Director of Czech Society denied the execution of verified transactions and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">Based on the tax management carried out in Slovakia, intra-Community delivery to the Czech Republic was questioned by the Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="185">The taxpayer will not be entitled to exemption from VAT and will be assessed by VAT from the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer should buy in 1. quarter 2005 from Slovakia goods (workwear) in total value 39 970 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech payer reported in this quarter the purchase of goods from another EU Member State only in DAP for a month of 3/2005, worth CZK 11 292 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax administrator carried out the local investigation for the purpose of verifying the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">Since the company did not submit any documents, or otherwise did not allow the realization of taxable performance, it measured it on 9. 6. 2005 tax administrator of VAT in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to the doubts about the implementation of the purchase of goods, the tax administrator sent two applications to Slovakia in May 2005 to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the response to the application for information, the tax administrator in Slovakia had doubts about the realization of business cases as well as the implementation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO of SR was communicated that the Slovak tax administrator sent DR CLO to perform simultaneous inspections with tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out by participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated audit, the competent tax administrator of another investigation on the Czech entity was carried out in the Czech Republic and the investigation of the Police of the Czech Republic took place.</seg>

<seg id="201">The Czech payer No. 2 had to buy in 4. quarter of 2004 goods (workwear) worth CZK 4,847 thousand and in 1. quarter 2005 goods worth 17 050 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="202">Since the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the competent tax administrator sent to Slovakia on 25. 5. 2005 request for information.</seg>
<seg id="203">The Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the realization of business cases and the implementation of the payment in response.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8. 6. 2005 was delivered to the MF CLO from Slovakia for information concerning the goods worth 16 575 thousand Sk, which was delivered to the Slovak payer No. 1 of the Czech payer No. 2. in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side demanded to examine whether the Czech payer no. 2 of the goods has actually accepted, admitted in DAP and did VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">From the official record, which elaborated locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, it follows that the Czech payer No. 2 does not look at the address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although it was a VAT payer with a monthly tax period, DAP submitted a quarterly taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="208">Due to this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not measure VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The taxable performance between the Slovak taxpayer No. 1 and the Czech payer No. 2 referred to in the application of CZK 16 575,000 was not possible.</seg>

<seg id="215">The response to this application for information delivered from Slovakia showed that in DAP the Slovak payer no. 4 introduced zero value to the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 stated the value of purchase of goods from another EU Member State only in the amount of 1 193 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="216">On the call for submission of tax documents for the tax period of the month 10/2004 to 3/2005 Slovak payer no. 4 did not respond.</seg>
<seg id="217">During the local investigation carried out in Slovakia, it was found that the company was not located at the address specified in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">In response, it was also said that this payer meets all the characteristics of the so-called "lost society", and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO of SR was communicated that the Slovak tax administrator sent DR CLO to perform simultaneous inspections with tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out with the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated control, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or refute the existence of goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be measured according to the result of investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case also deals with the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="223">Progress of the audit action</seg>
<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of parallel auditing events, the coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic with representatives of the SAO SR, took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants of this meeting met with legislative regulation in the field of VAT in both countries and incorporating the electronic system VIES into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The result of the meeting was the specification of the scope of cooperation and determining the conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that cooperation will focus on these areas: a) verification of validity and correctness of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic, or Slovakia during intra-Community delivery; b) verification of data on intra-community purchases listed in DAP payers in the Czech Republic using information from aggregate reports (hereinafter referred to as “SH”) payers from Slovakia contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia on the carried out business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities to control will be carried out following the volume of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of applications for international cooperation sent and adopted between the Czech Republic and Slovakia through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 IntraCommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The process of processing information by tax administrators of the Czech Republic and Slovakia during intra-Community delivery and the acquisition of goods depicts the following scheme.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 IntraCommunity delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer realizes intra-Community delivery, he is obliged to submit SH to the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic states aggregate information about the delivery of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in Slovakia is obliged to state the value of goods that were exempt from tax and delivered from the Czech Republic to other EU Member States for the period of calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">The data on the value of the delivered goods are always stated in SH in the Czech or Slovak currency in the subdivision according to individual tax entities indicating their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">The data on the services do not specify to SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that in SH introduced incorrect data, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the payer in Slovakia finds that the data referred to in SH were incomplete or incorrect, it shall be handed over before the deadline for submitting the SH correction, after this period is obliged to file additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system enables exchange of information on the registration data of payers registered for VAT in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Slices from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can verify whether the VAT number of the respective provider is registered in the EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">The data from the SH filed are grouped at the MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual VAT number of the buyers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The summary value of all deliveries for each DI number of the provider and the code of performance from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers is created, so-called L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from the L1QD files will be sent to the relevant EU Member States within three months of the end of the quarter, to which the data apply.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-Community performance between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from the L1QD files) is specified in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system finds incorrect VAT number of the buyer in another Member State in the sent L1QD files, it generates the so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all the wrong VAT number indicating the error type.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is then sent to MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect VAT number, the VAT number is not registered in the given country or has never been assigned, the buyer has not been a VAT payer in the given quarter, VAT registration is terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transfers data from received reports O_MCTL to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If there is an incorrect VAT number of the payer from the EU used in one of the sent lines SH or subsequent SH, the so-called “Announcement about the doubts to VAT ID” is generated on the relevant financial office.</seg>
<seg id="250">The Financial Office shall verify whether the taxpayer registered for VAT in another EU Member State has actually occurred and is recorded in the system of verification.</seg>
<seg id="251">DR CLO processes all O_MCTL reports in the VIES system in Slovakia and will send them electronically to the local tax authorities together with the identification of taxpayers who stated incorrect VAT number in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">Tax authorities subsequently call on the payers to submit an additional SH and the introduction of the valid VAT number or tax office when reporting invalid VAT number in the submitted SH will verify the delivery of goods for the respective payer.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of incorrect VAT number related to intra-Community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">From a total of 41 728 VAT number of Czech payers, listed in SH Slovak payers in the period from 2. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005, was 929 incorrect VAT number, i.e. 2,23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number of 62 997 VAT number of Slovak payers, listed in SH Czech payers in the same period, 416 incorrect VAT ID, i.e. 0,66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czech VAT payers stated less incorrect VAT No than the payers from Slovakia in their SH on average.</seg>
<seg id="257">When examining the activities of financial, virtually tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of tax entities for VAT in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although the VIES system has confirmed the validity of the tax entity registration in 4. The quarter of 2004, was subsequently generated by the O_MCTL report due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation was found to end the registration until the day 1. 1. 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO further found that 6 tax entities were submitted by SH, in which there was an incorrect VAT number, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain this VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="262">SH is transferred to the tax authorities in Slovakia and the data from them will be sent to DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">After the subsequent processing of this data in the VIES system, DR CLO sends the so-called errors in SH filed tax entities for the respective quarter to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO of SR compared data on the occurrence of incorrect data in SH to 26. 7. 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of control) and 2. 2. 2006 (i.e. data processed after the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="265">The data comparison contains the following table.</seg>
<seg id="266">From the above data it is evident that the SAO's control had an impact not only on reducing the number of SH with incorrect VAT number (average 199 SH per quarter), but also to reduce the number of corrected errors in SH (average 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-Community delivery referred to in the relevant DAP lines with the value of intra-community delivery referred to in this payer in the quarterly SH is compared to the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should examine the differences, to remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained when determining the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, the Czech Republic, found that the audited financial authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values referred to in SH and DAP amounted to CZK 537 231 thousand in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="272">From 3. quarter 2004 enabled the ADIS system to consider the tax administrator in the Czech Republic the difference between the values referred to in SH and DAP in the amount of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community delivery according to SH for compliance and set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">In payers with a large volume of intra-Community delivery for one quarter, 0.5% of the value of the negligible amount, therefore the tax administrators should not set the consensus of SH and DAP without clarifying the causes of differences in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, the tax administrator has set the consensus in the case of the difference in the amount of CZK 1,561 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="275">The verification of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH for each calendar quarter administered payers up to 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">The tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-Community delivery referred to in these DAP with values according to SH.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, tax administrators learned about any inconsistency of data in DAP and SH to the time when the tax obligation or excessive VAT deduction was measured, or. returned.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, among other things, information on intra-Community transactions carried out within the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, the delivered data from SH filed payers from other EU Member States (recommended L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">When processing, the data are converted by minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared to the value of the acquisition specified by Czech payers in DAP for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the purchase of goods reported by payers in DAP should be in the range of minimum and maximum conversion values L1QD (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value is reported in DAP lower than the L1min value, the so-called verification command is generated for the payer with the most important irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">Commands to verify the purchase of goods are alert to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the local tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of commands to verify regarding the audited financial offices in the Czech Republic is specified in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, the Czech Republic, found that the audited financial authorities in 33 cases did not believe inconsistencies in intra-Community acquisition values, which they pointed out the delivered commands to verify.</seg>
<seg id="288">The overall difference between the values referred to in SH payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers amounted to at least 148 319 thousand CZK in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, the Czech Republic, chose 533 writings of tax entities to which the audited financial authorities received the command to verify from the Ministry of CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The audit found the following most common causes of differences between the values referred to in DAP of the buyer and in SH supplier: on the page of the contract (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquireder did not specify the purchase of goods in the proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in another tax period than in which he was obliged to admit the tax, in 6 cases stated the buyer's value of the acquired goods into the wrong line DAP, on the supplier's side (sayer from the EU) in 88 cases, the suppliers included the value of the goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1. 5. 2004, in 5 cases suppliers included the value of received backups in SH.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the side of the sliced from Slovakia, the value of the services provided to SH was missing most often.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were found on audited financial offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, when investigating the order for verification, it was found that the difference in the value of 10 974 thousand CZK was created by the Slovak payer to SH for 1. quarter of 2005 providing services (building work and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values adopted by the backups in SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers stated in SH received backup from Czech payers, as a result of which the command to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000 was generated.</seg>
<seg id="295">Commands to verify the acquired goods are generated for one quarter only once.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where the data from SH, such as the change of the customer's goods in the Czech Republic or the increased value of the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new commands to verify the negative verification.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES system does not consider these changes automatically, the competent tax administrator may not be able to learn the right to determine the tax obligation from the acquired goods and there is a great probability of developing tax evasion for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">The audit of the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer stated in SH for 2. quarter 2004 value of delivery of goods for Czech payer of 1 504 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1. 2. 2005 sent the financial office to the local Czech payer to Slovakia application for information, because the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of goods only in the amount of CZK 425 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of tax proceedings, the Slovak payer filed on 1. 3. 2005 additional SH, in which corrected data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by a reduction of the value of delivery for the originally stated Czech payer on 538 thousand Sk and by increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the amount of 194 thousand Sk to 1 160 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers stated in their SH for 2. quarter 2004 intra-community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic in the total amount of 10 240 thousand. Sk (i.e. 8 183 thousand CZK).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech acquireders did not show intra-Community acquisition in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer who was not given in SH with Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During 1. The quarter of 2005 increased Slovak payers in additional SH relating to 2. quarter of 2004 the value of intra-community delivery for this Czech payer by 10 240 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="306">Due to the mentioned facts, the competent tax administrator could not have doubts about the correctness of the data in the submitted DAP for 2. quarter of 2004, although the real buyer did not meet the obligation to admit intra-Community acquisition for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, the Czech Republic, found that on the basis of an international exchange of information between tax administrators, VAT was additionally replaced by VAT for the tax period of 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640,000 and for 3. quarter of 2004 in the amount of CZK 3,305,000 from the acquired goods in these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">From the aforementioned facts, it is evident that the tax administrator had to examine not only the differences arising from the errors in DAP by the Provider in tax proceedings, but also the differences caused by different reporting of intra-Community delivery data and acquisition in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">The unification of the conditions for reporting this data would lead to the streamlining of the control activities of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="311">The APV DIS system allows you to compare data about the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU Member States with data referred to in DAP of Slovak buyers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method that compares the data is called the "M MIN-MAX method".</seg>
<seg id="313">With this method, the conversion of the delivery values of the goods referred to in SH canvas from other EU Member States will take place with a minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">The MIN-MAX interval is created, which is used for comparison with the values of the purchase of goods specified in DAP Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CLO sends information about intra-Community acquisition to tax administrators listed in DAP and the values of delivery from the EU in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator decides which persons registered for VAT will be verified, and other risk analysis criteria are taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="317">Based on the data provided by CLO, the SAO chose 57 writings of Slovak buyers of goods to control the audited tax authorities, of which 25 payers acquired goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in DAP were found.</seg>
<seg id="318">The SAO's audit was confirmed by the fact that the tax administrator consistently did not verify the differences obtained by the MIN-MAX method and did not verify the correctness of the data referred to in DAP of Slovak procurement.</seg>
<seg id="319">The SAO of the Slovak Republic under the control requested tax authorities for 47 local investigations for specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the SAO audit, 31 local investigations were terminated on tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="321">In Slovak companies, which in the acquisition of goods from EU Member States the VIES system reported considerable differences in the values of MIN-MAX, these facts were found:</seg>
<seg id="322">In DAP for 4. quarter of 2004 Slovak payer did not bring value to the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic stated in SH for 4. quarter 2004 by mistaken VAT number of this payer, whereas the goods worth 19 184 thousand CZK in fact delivered another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, the Slovak company had in 4. quarter 2004 to buy goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria worth MIN 682 692 thousand. Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company filed DAP for the given period in which it stated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU only in the amount of 480 599 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, found that the tax entity bought electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and DAP intra-Community deliveries did not specify according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">Due to other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax administrator shall apply for verification of the value of the delivered goods through the SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">Acquisition of goods from EU Member States in 4. The Slovak payer in DAP did not specify the quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this canvas should be purchased in the value of MIN 11 286 thousand Sk and MAX 11 845 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office carried out the local investigation, the audit resulted that the tax entity in 4. The quarter of 2004 has not received any goods from EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO of SR recommended the tax office to apply for verification of the delivery of goods from EU Member States through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the VIES system, the delivery of goods for the Slovak customer worth MIN 557 thousand was reported. Sk and MAX 565 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="334">In DAP for the tax period of the months 10 to 12/2004 the payer did not show any purchase of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">The local investigation of the tax administrator found that the tax entity received on 10. 12. 2004 from the supplier from the Czech Republic invoice for the material consumed during the repair of the hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO of SR recommended for a tax inspection payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the SAO audit in 16 cases, the local investigation did not end the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases of the SAO, the SAO requested tax administrator to carry out tax control for tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections shall be submitted by tax authorities after their implementation of the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="340">These were, for example, these cases:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak captain did not lead in DAP for 4. quarter of 2004 in the acquisition of goods from EU Member States and for the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004 did not admit any tax and claimed a refund of excessive VAT deduction in the total amount of 1 236 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out the local investigation from which it resulted that the tax entity acquired goods worth CZK 683 thousand (approximately 27 080 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="343">The goods were transported from the Czech Republic by the Czech supplier at the customs duties in Čiernej nad Tisou, where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>

<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, especially when controlling the claim for exemption from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation enabled to examine selected intra-Community transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="371">By verifying selected transactions, the tax administration of both countries has been found to have detected the tax administration of both countries in cases of companies that have implemented fictitious intra-Community business transactions in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions as well as cases where the receipts have not entered VAT from the received deliveries of goods in the right amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">The audits were further found in the processing and use of data from the VIES tax administrators of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also pointed out problems caused by different reporting of intra-community delivery data and purchases of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">The unification of the conditions for reporting this data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activities of the tax administrators of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="375">By verifying the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system, the financial or tax authorities did not use all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal permissions.</seg>
<seg id="376">It was also found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and validity of tax entities for VAT in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO of SR compared data on the occurrence of incorrect data in SH, processed before the start of the audit, with data processed after the end of the audit performance.</seg>
<seg id="378">Compared to this data, it was clear that the SAO's audit had an influence not only on reducing the number of SH with incorrect VAT number, but also to reducing the number of corrected errors in SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In the case of inconsistencies in the reported data of the SAO, tax authorities requested the implementation of local investigations, or to carry out tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic, did not have such an opportunity within the framework of applicable legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The knowledge obtained from the auditing actions resulted that the VIES system provided the tax administrators with basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Since there is still a space for tax evasion in this area, it is necessary to pay increased attention when managing VAT.</seg>

<seg id="46">- error in entering data into customs databases has prevented identifying some imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- some exports from the Czech Republic were not proven adequate imports to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="48">In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for unauthorized application of value added tax deductions,</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax entities did not meet some statutory obligations in reporting imports and exports in tax returns to tax added tax,</seg>
<seg id="50">- in the activities of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax and consumer taxes and in their cooperation with customs authorities, deficiencies were found.</seg>

<seg id="72">In the first phase, the comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out, in the second stage the results of this comparison were used in mutual verification of the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and during inspections carried out in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of the control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT inspections and SpD was presented at the working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO SR in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003 a coordination meeting was carried out, which was agreed by the selection of commodities - types of goods, which represented a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax regulations: - hatch and spirits, customs tariff items no. 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, customs tariff items No.2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, items and subpoles of customs tariff no. 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, lower-component conditions No 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax entities to control will be carried out: a) from unguided items identified by the comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, b) from entities implementing imports and exports regularly or one-off in large volume, c) based on the findings from the audits carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first phase, a mechanism of mutual assignment of JCD items registered in customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was tested on the sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, part of exports from the Czech Republic was compared to imports to Slovakia in 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Ethylalcohol non-attered with volume alcohol content 80% Order. or more; ethyl alcohol and other distillates denatured, with any alcohol content,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Ethylalcohol non-attered with volume alcohol content less than 80% Order.; Distillates, liqueurs and other liquids,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 cigars (also with cut end), cigars (cigarillos) and tobacco cigarettes or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenized or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishment (esence),</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmitting apparatus containing receiving device: For cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmitting apparatus containing receiving device: Other,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts and components suitable for use exclusively or mainly with number 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Others: Parts and parts of the devices belonging to the sub pencil 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">Items JCD from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were assigned to each other on the basis of conformity of individual paragraphs JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration mark of the vehicle transporting the cargo, date of transition of the state border, item of customs tariff, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are given in the following tables and graphs.</seg>
<seg id="92">Mutual assignment of individual imports and exports made it difficult among others the fact that business transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD were declared on multiple import JCDs in Slovakia, or the export JCD had a different number of items from import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that affect the success of assignment was a different composition of data in customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as a time shift between the records of exports in the customs database of one country and records corresponding to imports in the customs database of the second country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples on audited financial or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="96">Some tax entities, which have carried out imports, or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have failed to identify in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, some tax entities are selected for VAT verification in tax returns reported in tax returns, where the data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot control on the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma</seg>
<seg id="99">The boundary customs transition for the performance of pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unaccounted items JCD in customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="100">Based on the bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it was introduced on border customs transitions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia to use control sheets.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as much as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport transporting goods of commercial nature in the customs space and to create conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The common pilot control was carried out from 8. 3. 2004 to 26. 3. 2004 and was focused on verifying this system of customs control.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for use of control sheets on the border crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Consideration of the vehicle, issuing the control sheet and its handover of the driver.</seg>

<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in imports and exports of goods and services and evaluation of the level of cooperation between financial and customs authorities, writings of tax entities under the following criteria were selected for audited financial or tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. from customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, tax entities were selected: a) with the highest volume of imports, b) with the highest amount of VAT excluded, c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">2. from the financial or tax authorities' records were selected tax entities according to the above: a) applied VAT deductions when importing, b) applied excessive VAT deductions, c) to return SpD, d) applied exemption from VAT in exports,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. tax entities where tax checks were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="180">The sample selection was carried out regardless of the country of destination with a focus on risk commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports to the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic at risk commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Checking the selected sample on the financial offices</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused mainly on the audited financial authorities:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of financial authorities in verifying the correctness of the reported VAT,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation of financial authorities with customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database on the financial authorities with a focus on the comparison of the declared value, application of the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or. comparison of data on JCD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- comparison of data from VAT tax returns on carried out and received fully from abroad with data in the JCD database on financial offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- method of verification of the claim for exemption from VAT in export of goods or provision of services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- comparison of the volume of export of goods or services provided in tax returns for VAT with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database contained only records of those imports and exports in which it was established by tax entities obligation to state import or export to tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited financial authorities were verified by the writings of tax entities reported in tax returns in 2002 and 2003 by imports in the total amount of CZK 60 396 379 thousand and corresponding VAT in the total amount of CZK 12 644 052 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the writings of tax entities reporting in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were checked in the total value of 47 323 111 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="194">Tax entities where imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were examined, carried out according to the customs database of the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003 imports to the Czech Republic from Slovakia with the total basis of VAT in the amount of CZK 3,759 352 thousand, VAT of 767 607 thousand CZK and exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia with a total statistical value of 1 989 090 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="195">The found differences between the records in the JCD database on the financial offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items that were missing in the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly to the Directorate-General of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- in the JCD items, which were missing in the financial authorities database, it was verified whether it was a cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for items JCD, where different values between the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the database of financial offices were found, the relevant JCD in writing, including the attached invoices, was requested to the Directorate-General of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="199">When examining it was found that the JCD database on the financial offices did not contain, for example, the records of import JCD in the total VAT value 3 622 thousand CZK and the records of export JCD in the total statistical value of 9 359 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Determined differences</seg>
<seg id="201">By comparing the JCD database on financial offices and cumulative tax obligations for 2002 and 2003 in tax returns for VAT for the selected sample of tax entities, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="202">Differences in values were caused in particular:</seg>
<seg id="203">- Time shift between imports and the application of a claim for VAT deduction measured during import of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The tax entity could claim the deduction of the tax on the import of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the goods were dismissed into the relevant regime or in the case of temporary use regime within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which this regime was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- Time shift between the implementation of export and the moment the tax entity received JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The tax entity was obliged to provide data on the exported exports exempt from the obligation to apply the tax on the tax return to the VAT tax return first for the tax period in which the goods had performed from the Czech Republic if the tax document was simultaneously, which JCD was.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Completion of obligations of tax entities in reporting imports and exports in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">Tax entities in some cases did not indicate the correct data on imports and exports to tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">Since tax entities did not have to add lists of JCDs to the submitted tax return, the claim for deduction of VAT or exemption from VAT by financial authorities was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Activity of financial and customs bodies</seg>
<seg id="211">On the basis of the decision of customs authorities, the audited period occurred to return or waive import or export duties and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax entities were imposed the obligation to reduce the previously claimed VAT deduction by the amount of tax returned by the Customs Office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was returned.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legal regulation did not regulate the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs authorities to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited financial authorities received this information, but irregularly or with considerable time delay and only from some customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited financial office did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office has not received information about changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, the data needed to check the fulfilment of the legal obligation of tax entities has not been available.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002 the customs authorities returned to the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of over CZK 398 million.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit pointed out the persisting deficiencies in the activities of tax administrators, some system errors in cooperation with the financial authorities with customs administration authorities and the fulfilment of certain obligations of payers s serving tax returns and SpD.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the administration of VAT and SpD, deficiencies were found especially in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">a) during the cancellation of the VAT registration was the fulfilment of the obligations of the payers to take VAT from the commercial property registered, or which was to be registered as of the date of cancellation, where the payer applied the tax deduction, only rarely verified,</seg>
<seg id="221">b) tax authorities consistently did not use the opportunity to make tax control or local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">In some cases, the legitimacy of the claim for VAT deduction occurred in some cases,</seg>
<seg id="223">c) official records and protocols about oral conduct did not contain all the necessary data proving the legitimacy applied by excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="224">d) tax authorities did not sufficiently verify imports and exports reported in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Checking the selected sample on tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample of the SAO SR, he verified or taxed the tax inspection for the tax period of 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After the analysis of filed tax returns and requests for tax refund for selected tax entities of the SAO, the tax office requested a tax office to ensure relevant JCD documenting imports and exports, invoices and documents on tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO audited the SR whether the JCD registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of decisive facts and legal conditions in the application of tax deduction on entry from the title of imports, when returning excessive VAT deduction, when applying exemption from the title of exports and when returning SpD.</seg>
<seg id="230">The SAO of Slovakia on 10 audited tax authorities verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the honour of JCD items and sums of statistical values referred to in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports in the statistical value of 856,2 million Sk, representing 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">The exports of selected commodities were checked in the total statistical value of 176 million Sk, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from Slovakia to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">Furthermore, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white techniques, packaging technology and software) from EU countries to Slovakia in total statistical value of 532,8 million Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Activity of tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO of Slovakia has found inconsistencies between data registered in the Slovak Republic and data reported in specific tax returns for VAT, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (physical persons) stated in tax returns imports of goods in the total value of 1,589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excessive VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">During local investigations carried out on the NKÚ SR initiative, tax entities failed to prove the legitimacy of the tax office to apply tax on the entry into the relevant documents on the implementation of imports and VAT payment,</seg>
<seg id="238">- tax entity (s. r. o.) In the tax return for the January 2003 tax period declared the received taxable performance worth 77 167 576 Sk, export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and applied excessive VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">The tax returns of VAT submitted for 2003 implies that the difference between the volume of purchase and exports worth 59 161 535 Sk, which was established in January 2003, was not balanced throughout 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above cases, the SAO of Slovakia asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out the tax inspection applied excessive VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 stated in tax returns for VAT exports of goods in the total value of 87 199 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="242">By verifying the customs database of Slovakia, it was found that the tax entity carried out exports in the statistical value of 296 747 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax office carried out a local investigation at the company's registered office, and found out that the company's Managing Director traveled and left the company leased premises without termination of the lease contract in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the audit of the SAO, the tax administrator submitted the tax administrator to the authorities in criminal proceedings of the notification of suspicion of committing a crime of tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit on selected tax offices, the SAO states that the biggest problems in the performance of VAT and VAT control and SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- use of the possibility to carry out tax control of VAT for problematic tax entities, especially in cases of application of high value of excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="247">- protocols from tax control did not contain a list of audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD in import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient examination of reported imports and export of goods in tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy management of tax administrators when issuing a decision, especially within the assessment proceedings, as well as due to termination of the right to exchange penalties,</seg>
<seg id="251">- non-compliance with legal conditions in providing payments of tax payments,</seg>
<seg id="252">- uncompensation of VAT fees within a refund of excessive VAT deduction,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and enforcement of tax fees.</seg>
<seg id="254">Based on the control of the found deficiencies of the SAO, the relevant tax authorities asked for tax inspection of VAT with a focus on the legitimacy of applied excessive VAT deductions at 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">At all audited tax authorities, measures were taken to eliminate the control of the identified deficiencies whose performance will be monitored and controlled by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation enabled the verification of commercial transactions carried out between business partners from both countries and pointed out deficiencies in the records of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The result of the audits was further detection of persisting deficiencies in fulfilling the obligations of VAT payers and SpD, in the activities of financial or tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the effectiveness and effectiveness of tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="259">The acquired knowledge also revealed that the financial authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic. There is no similar system of transfer of information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administration in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of VAT management and SpD was not identical due to the different legal regulation and conditions on the territory of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from the information obtained in the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available on audited financial offices. The SAO verified the realization of commercial transactions from documents requested by tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the case of finding inconsistencies, tax authorities requested tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel control in the area of VAT and SpD assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period before entering the European Union and pointed out the necessity of further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will continue to deepen in the control of the activities of financial or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of a new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of the so-called summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be submitted by all VAT payers who have made the delivery of goods to another Member State registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">The tax administrators are obliged to enter data from aggregate reports to the VIES system (VAT Information Exchange System), to which they have access to the tax administrator from the European Union Member States.</seg>
<seg id="268">Financial or tax authorities are then able to compare this data with the data provided in the tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is further used to verify the validity of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT, verifying the legitimacy of the exempt from VAT for delivery of goods to another Member State and to control proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">Implementation of parallel auditing events showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these auditing actions will be confronted with the outputs of the upcoming auditing events, which will focus among other things on the verification of the VIES system, which has to defend tax evasion in the so-called “intra-community deliveries”.</seg>
<seg id="272">Due to the importance of VAT and SpD for budgetary income, control activities are necessary to focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to limit the space for tax evasion of indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">The migration of the population belongs to the phenomena that have a global character and have become an inseparable part of the current development stage of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its cause is mainly the escape of citizens from the country of origin or the last permanent residence before persecution, especially for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to obtain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of the developed democratic countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">The large group also consists of foreigners whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not new.</seg>
<seg id="11">Determination of specific principles of aid to refugees has brought the adoption of the Geneva Agreement from 1951 and New York Protocol from 1967 on the legal status of refugees whose acceptance of the government signatory countries undertook to apply them in their foreign policy orientation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their attitude towards refugee issues by continuing in the performance of adopted international documents and their commitment to national legislation confirmed the legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics of the provision of asylum enshrined even in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">The asylum process and related questions were focused on parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, whose results contain the common final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the highest auditing authorities of both countries was implemented on the basis of the “Contract of Cooperation in Audit Activities” (hereinafter referred to as the “Contract") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">Both parties undertook to provide each other with information on legal regulations governing asylum proceedings in the state of the second contracting party, selected statistical data relating to the number of asylum-seekers and asylum process results as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to type the same problem circuits and to point out the consequences that result from the area of migration of the population.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of auditing events, in exchange of information in the extent specified by the Contract and in the elaboration of the joint final report on the results of the audits.</seg>
<seg id="20">During the first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, the same circuits of controlled issues and control procedures were determined in the preparation of auditing events.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the second meeting, which took place on 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, the common points for the control action program were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the third joint meeting, which took place during the auditing operation on 8.11. to 10.11.2004, the experience of ongoing inspections took place.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of outputs from the inspections and preliminarily determined structure and content of the common final report were specified, which was developed from 14 February to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audits were carried out in parallel from September 2004 to January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, auditors carried out the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited bodies were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the “MV") and the Management of Refugee Equipment of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the “SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic carried out the control of the section of defense, vnútra and the stables.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migrant Council of the Ministry of vnútra SR (hereinafter referred to as the "MÚ").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data for a longer period of time are used in the common report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of control results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of the audited inspections was: - asylum process, - asylum device, - management of funds and property of the state, - internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mutual exchange of acquired experience between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place in the phase of preparation and implementation of auditing events.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange enabled more thoroughly assessed the submitted documents, to analyze the causes of the identified asylum process differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">So it was possible to concentrate on decisive problems influencing the activity of asylum devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">ultimately it has been positively on the quality of control activities.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="39">Harmonization of asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with documents of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”) was subject to evaluation reports of the European Commission to read both countries to enter the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the adoption of legislation governing this area, it continues even after the entry of both countries into the EU in order to further harmonize with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum-seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a permanently growing trend, while a significant increase in applicants occurred in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers in the sense of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The state budget of both countries excludes the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is affected mainly by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings to granting or granting asylum and also the health status of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="48">In asylum facilities, accommodation, food, health care and basic material equipment and hygienic needs is provided for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organized in leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include the entrance centres and stay centres, in the Czech Republic and integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one stay day depends on occupancy and amenities of the centre and are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase its increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create conditions for applicants whose growing number will be to continue in connection with the application of the Dublin Convention as expected in the following years.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budgetary expenditure was spent on the security of services. The decisive expenditure of this item was expenditure on accommodation and food applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditure on health care provided to applicants for asylum and costs of permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">The expenditure on salaries, payments for the work carried out and insurance was also involved in the total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process marked by many budgetary measures, which solved the legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance, expenditure on material and services and expenditure on security services contributed to the drawing of common expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed out some similar deficiencies that had no major impact on financial management and management of state property.</seg>
<seg id="60">It was a shortcomings especially in the area of the use of state budget funds in conflict with the purpose of which the state budget was intended for the state budget, when the events were covered by the character of technical appreciation of long-term tangible property.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Accounting Act was also violated in the area of inventory and in failure to comply with the accounting curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies in the management of the state property were further found when it was transferred to the use of another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">By not keeping the deadline for reporting changes in the Land Register data, the Land Register Act was violated and the transfer of waste to the disposal of a person who was not entitled to waste waste, was violated by the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, deficiencies in providing disproportionately high backups to electricity and natural gas consumption were further found, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of state property when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of liquidation of unnecessary property was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system was ensured in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic in the sense of valid generally binding legislation governing the method of financial control.</seg>
<seg id="66">deficiencies were not found in the submitted written documentation.</seg>
<seg id="67">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and despite some identified deficiencies, the SUZ and MÚ assess positively in securing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the knowledge obtained during the audit, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic state that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum-seekers in recent years, the competent organizational units of both countries have managed tasks associated with the care of asylum seekers at the appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the audit were discussed with the interested statutory representatives of the relevant organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the control be used at other joint auditing events within the framework of international cooperation of the highest audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law from the Geneva Convention from 1951 (The Convention on the Legal Status of Refugees and the following New York Protocol from 1967) is published.</seg>
<seg id="74">498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">It is from 1. 1. 2000 effective Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and Amendment to Act No.83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="76">217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">In the legislative process, there are currently two more amendments to Act No.325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, and the adoption of other amendments will be bound to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd EU pillars and the documents of asylum were in terms of political documents.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already within the acceptance of this law, the effort was to be as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">An important change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from 3rd to 1st pillar, when asylum law became part of the Community law from 1.5. 1999 on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has caused the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in the appropriate legal obligation.</seg>
<seg id="82">The competibility of the Czech asylum law with EU documents was the subject of regular evaluation reports of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">The key community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before entering or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the audit of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic has not yet elapsed.</seg>
<seg id="84">After their implementation into the Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission how transposition carried out.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in the proceedings on the confession of the position of refugee and determining the obligations of foreigners who asked for the confession of the position of refugee, or which was provided a temporary refuge in the Slovak Republic, set the law of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 283/1995 Z. z., for refugee.</seg>
<seg id="86">480/2002 Z. z“ o asylum and on the change and completion of certain laws in which harmonization of the legal regulation of the Slovak Republic was incorporated by the Council of Europe 2001/55/EC from 20. 7. 2001 by minimum standards for providing temporary protection in case of mass inflow of displaced persons and measures to promote balance of efforts between Member States in the adoption of these persons and to endure resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to Act No. 480/2002 From z., o asylum, in 2003 and 2004 the third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005 which means further harmonization of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation in the field of migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the determination of the obligation for asylums to visit for the duration of the stay in the integration centre of the foundations of the Slovak language, determination of the guardian courts at non-footed foreigners, if they stay in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, enabling applicants to enter the employment relationship under certain circumstances referred to in the amendment to the law.</seg>
<seg id="89">Harmonization of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU law in the field of migration and asylum process was assessed in regular reports of the European Commission for readiness to enter the Slovak Republic to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002 the report was highlighted in insufficient personnel capacity of the Ministry, which did not correspond to an increased number of applicants for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, they have been involved in the competence of the Ministry of Finance since 1990.</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective from 1. 1. 1996 was established by the Ministry of Agriculture of the SUZ state. The reason was the Department of State Administration Performance in the field of asylum procedures, which is carried out through the asylum and migration policy department of MV, from securing the services to applicants for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide for the MV providing accommodation, catering, health and other services to the participants of the asylum and asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, it fulfils the decisive tasks in the field of asylum process of the MÚ, especially in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process in the extent defined by special regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are related to the decision-making on the applications of foreigners to award asylum in the 1st degree of administrative proceedings and complex operation of asylum facilities in the area of accommodation, food, health, financial and material security of asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, he prepares the concept for the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the field of asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have significantly influenced cooperation and support from the UN High Commissioner's Office for Refugees (hereinafter referred to as the “UNHCR”).</seg>
<seg id="99">A special contribution was his financial participation in the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylums.</seg>
<seg id="100">UNHCR co-financed social, cultural and sports activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of asylum-seekers and asylum process results</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of asylum-seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the chart.</seg>
<seg id="103">The significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 the increased number of refugees from Chechnya was manifested.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of asylum proceedings in the Czech Republic is given in Table No.1.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the audited period he was awarded asylum in total in 394 cases, of which 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 cases in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">A total of 22 731 cases were not awarded in the audited period and in 22 636 cases the asylum management was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of participants in the proceedings as of 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been issued a decision, so those who have not been handed over.</seg>
<seg id="108">Furthermore, there are also persons who have been waived by the deadline for submission of the appeal or which the previous decision has been cancelled and has not yet been issued new.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum-seekers has a permanently growing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, it was already 10 358 people in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="111">A significant increase in the number of applicants occurred in 2001, when 8 131 applicants were registered, which represented an increase of 423% against 2000, in which it applied for asylum 1 556 persons.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of asylum proceedings in the Slovak Republic in the controlled period are given in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylums and their number did not exceed 0.222% of the registered number of applicants were awarded in the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not awarded in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum proceedings were stopped in 23 088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">Most of the applicants, by delayed outside the asylum facilities, voluntarily left asylum proceedings before its termination.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003 more than 94% of people.</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of the stay of one applicant in one of the asylum facilities, recalculated on the average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The knowledge of the MÚ also shows that most of the applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are the search for better living conditions, i.e. the so-called economic migration, which has no support in the documents adopted by the international community, which the Slovak Republic has also registered.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases, the asylum system is purposefully used by the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="121">The application for asylum based on economic reasons such as finding a job or better living conditions is not a reason for granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such a request should be under § 12 of the suction. 1 letter. a) Act No. 480/2002 Z. z., o asylum, assessed as apparently unjustified and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Until now, internationally recognized principles have not been created to identify economic migrants that would distinguish them from applicants persecuted in the country of origin and which would allow to accelerate asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="124">Due to the mentioned facts, it is possible to state that the Slovak Republic is in terms of international migration of transit countries and target countries of migration were and remain Western European countries.</seg>
<seg id="125">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the Agreement determining the state responsible for the assessment of asylum applications submitted in one of the Member States of the European Community (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents the administration of multiple purpose applications for asylum granting in more EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants return to the country of the first registration after positive identification in the EURODAC system.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, so the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions for a stay in the Slovak Republic until the issue of a decision on granting or granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Drawing funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to applicants for asylum-seekers in the sense of international agreements and emerging national legislative adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budget of both countries excludes the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is influenced mainly by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings up to the competent decision on the granting asylum and also their health status.</seg>
<seg id="133">The growing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on higher pumping of statutory doses for applicants such as food expenditure, pocket money, basic material equipment expenditure, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, 58 CZK per person per day was in the audited period, pocket money 12 CZK per person per day and 6 CZK per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The costs of one asylum seeker for one stay day were on average 351 CZK in 2001, 383 CZK in 2002 and 345 CZK in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">Outside pocket money, asylum-seekers can be accommodated in residential resorts with a separate cooking and applicants staying in private outside asylum facilities provided a contribution up to the amount of life minimum.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, among other things, admits in § 84 municipalities entitled to a contribution to the payment of costs spent in connection with asylum facilities in its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was determined annually by the Government Resolution and in the audited period amounted to CZK 7 per person and the stay day.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to the payment of non-investment costs of primary schools, which are attended by applicants for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the contribution was in the audited period 120 CZK per pupil and the month for the conditions that the person concerned attending the school for at least 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic was in the controlled period of meals 70 Sk per person and day, pocket 12 Sk per person and day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost of one asylum-seeker for one stay day was on average 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">480/2002 Z. z., o asylum, provided a contribution to partial payment of expenditures that the municipality will spend in connection with the establishment and activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="145">The municipalities used only partially the opportunity to apply for a contribution set out in the amount of 1,500 Sk per bed and calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">The National Legislation in both countries for the issuance of a asylum decision sets a 90-day period from the initiation of asylum proceedings while admitting the extension of this period in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for the extension of asylum proceedings, which affects the amount of expenditure of the state budget, is the administration of remedies against the decision on the granting of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of powers was issued in the interval between 90 and 180 days (31,54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days from the date of submission of a asylum application (17,61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum proceedings initiated in 2001-2003 were competent in one year from their launch.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the period within two years since the initiation of asylum proceedings, it was competent for 92% of the granting of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to the MÚ data, up to 90% of the applicants who have not been granted asylum, use the law stipulated by the possibility of extending the deadline for a remedy to the court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases, it was an extension of more than a year and the control was not terminated at the time of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="154">A certain contribution to the shortening of asylum proceedings is expected from establishing joint departments of the MÚ and Úradu bordering and cudzineckej fields of the Policajný zboru in the admission centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and in Liptovska Vlachoch, to which the performance of control from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This is assumed to simplify procedures and shorten the management time between the two asylum process components.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum equipment</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to the participants of the asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="158">During the stay, asylum-seekers are provided accommodation, food, health care, pocket money and basic material equipment and hygienic needs during the stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses under leisure activities and applicants are organized conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum equipment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">The SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is the competent farming property in the premises of the entrance centre Vyšní Lhoty, admission and residence centre Červený Újezd, stay resorts Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the buildings of integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, the entrance centre in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport was established.</seg>
<seg id="163">The SUZ further ensures the operation of asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity based on § 80 para. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the entrance centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of stay centres is 1 977 seats.</seg>
<seg id="165">Admission centres are closed devices that may not leave for asylum-seekers until the implementation of prescribed medical examination and basic admission procedures referred to in Act No.325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violation of the obligation to reside in the admission centre is evaluated as a transfer.</seg>
<seg id="167">Sojourn resorts in which asylum-seekers come from the admission centres, serves for accommodation of asylum-seekers until the conquest of the legal power of the decision on their application for granting or granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="168">For the fulfilment of certain conditions, asylum-seekers have the opportunity to leave the stay resorts or wish. staying in privacy.</seg>
<seg id="169">Applicants for asylum have in the admission and stay centres in which they are reported to stay, the right to free accommodation, the provision of meals, other services and pocket conditions, that they have succeeded in the tasks necessary to determine their financial and property conditions, and these conditions are such that they cannot be fairly requested or partial payment of these services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for temporary accommodation of persons who have been awarded asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the resort on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension to the time before they manage to ensure adequate housing or ensure it themselves within the state integration program.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients pay all the costs of accommodation and meals individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with the awarded position of refugees have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Costs of Asylum Equipment</seg>
<seg id="175">For comparison asylum devices he was elected as the best indicative indicator of the cost of one physical stay day.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the factual number of persons who have actually been provided to the services provided by the asylum facilities every day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, the devices operated by the SUZ designated as their own and equipment operated by legal entities on the basis of § 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one stay day in a asylum facility operated by the SUZ decreases with the increasing fulfilment of these facilities. The cause is that fixed costs of object operation are calculated on more asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The volume of total costs spent on ensuring the services for asylum seekers increases directly with their growing number.</seg>
<seg id="180">Between 2001 and 2003 there were in its own asylum facilities for accommodation of applicants in the crisis capacity.</seg>
<seg id="181">In the part of 2003 it was even a solution to the capacity crisis, caused by a mass arrival of asylum-seekers of the Czech nationality from Poland, the extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (total 320 beds) was used.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was ensured in the form of renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">The expenditure on one applicant for one stay day was in these years lower.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, long-term maintenance of the high fullness of these devices is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">It is necessary to take into account the risks of unexpected tide of refugees and the associated requirement for the need for a higher accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to perform some repairs, maintenance and investment during fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum equipment operated by the contractual enables the acceptance of operative solutions in the field of asylum equipment.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum equipment in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are admission centres and resorts.</seg>
<seg id="190">The MÚ has in its administration the entrance centre Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the stay centre Brezová pod Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the entrance centres is 470 seats and 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">The growing number of asylum-seekers was addressed by the MÚ by establishing a stay centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University Bratislava with a flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 seats.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the concluded contract, the lease also ensures the provision of services associated with the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, MÚ solved the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The stay centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Admission centres should in the controlled period occupancy in average from 57% to 62%, in resorts it was on average from 33% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="197">The occupancy changed according to the season and the highest was in recent months of the year when he asked for asylum to many more applicants compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Another increase in accommodation capacities about 450 seats will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">After completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Costs of Asylum Equipment</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the amount of costs of operation of asylum equipment are specified in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of asylum equipment by another entity, which provides premises and ensures the operation of the equipment, including the associated activities, is one of the possibilities to secure the tasks arising from the stay of asylum-seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Financial management and state property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Management Analysis</seg>
<seg id="205">In 2001, the budgetary expenditure of SUZ was increased by thirteen budget measures by 103 077 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of which 89 979 thousand CZK (87,29%) were purposefully determined means. The majority was intended for solving the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (44 538 thousand CZK) and ensuring health care provided by asylum seekers (38 870 thousand CZK).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, the expenditure of SUZ was increased by twenty budgetary measures by CZK 88 362 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of which 62 282 thousand CZK (70,48%) were purposefully intended for the funds of which the majority of (53 200 thousand CZK) was intended for health care provided by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, the expenditure of SUZ was increased by CZK 88 078,000 to CZK 88 078,000.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of which 82,000 thousand CZK (93,09%) amounted to the purpose intended funds released from the General Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 1,000,000 was intended for health care provided to applicants for asylum, CZK 24,000,000 to address the inflow of Czech refugees and CZK 7,000 for the programme of humanitarian evacuation of disabled inhabitants of the Iraqi Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">The overview of the drawdown of selected SUZ expenditure in the controlled period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">From the above overview it is clear that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on ensuring the services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenditure spent on the purchase of services ranged from 37,07% to 38,23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The underlying expenditure in this entry was the expenditure for accommodation and food applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditure on medical care provided to applicants for asylum and costs of permanent security service ensuring security in individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The expenditure on salaries, payments for the work done and insurance (23.99% - 24,97%) contributed to the total SUZ expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, the purchases of material (approximately 14%) were significantly involved in the total SUZ expenditure, and the highest share in these expenditures was the purchase of food (7,61% ? 9,83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the MÚ on the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures solved by the legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">For the design and schedule of budget in the expenditure part, the imbalance between the requirements of the MÚ, based on the increase in the number of applicants for asylum and the needs of the financing of their legal claims, was characteristic in the main category of common expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The budget chapter administrator solved several budget measures during the year by which he increased the limit of current expenditure in 2001 by 41.8% and in 2002 by up to 71.7%.</seg>
<seg id="221">The overview of the drawdown of selected expenditure of the MÚ in the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">The pumping of common expenditures contributed to wage expenditure, salaries and premiums in the span from 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on material and services in span from 21.04% to 38,82% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% consisted of expenditure on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% of food purchase expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another important part represented the expenditure for accommodation and catering services by a share from 10.82% to 26,96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">The relatively low proportion in the span from 1.03% to 6.25% consisted of capital expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Determined deficiencies</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed out some similar deficiencies that had no major impact on financial management and state property.</seg>
<seg id="228">It was a shortcomings especially in the following areas: a) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which the state budget law was determined, when the current expenditures were covered by the character of technical appreciation of long-term tangible property; b) breach of the Accounting Act in the field of inventory and in non-compliance with the directional accounting curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies in the management of the state's property were further found, when it was left to use another person without a proper contract; by not keeping the deadline for reporting the data of the cadastre of real estate, the Land Register Act was violated; by leaving waste to the disposal of a person who was not entitled to waste waste, the Waste Act was violated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel inspections of expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Úvodní slovo</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, it would be difficult to represent modern, dynamic and especially united Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quality transport networks are an essential condition for maintaining and increasing the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of persons and costs is an important task for state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is the task of very demanding both organizational and technical and financial terms.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts to sustainable mobility often and difficult to seek compromises with interest in Europe to maintain a healthy and suitable environment for a person.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction of transport infrastructure, even thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, are financially demanding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considered procedures and decision-making of state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings in public financial resources, which can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of audit institutions is to actively search for deficiencies that led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and efficiency of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">The auditing institutions should not only draw attention to the identified deficiencies, but recommend measures that will lead to an improvement in the condition for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the “BRH”) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the “NKÚ”) carried out parallel control of expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The highway is connected by a border bridge, which co-financed both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH could perform a thorough control of the efficiency of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on close cooperation with BRH, the SAO acquired the necessary data on the amount of German costs on bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract on the construction of the border bridge in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction procedure, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the procurement, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “ŘSD”) committed errors that led to the extension of the competition time and shortening the construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract was thus signed later than it was expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed that the bridge will be built in a shorter time and ensures its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, ŘSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint inspection works, the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17, based on the conversion to m2 of the bridge structure area were compared.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical price analysis enabled to identify bridges with high costs of m2 of space.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in the group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.</seg>
<seg id="26">The increase in the price could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the custom procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analyzing the costs of the construction of tunnels, auditors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and NKÚ now have a database of bridges and tunnels prices, which will be able to rely on future inspections of the efficiency of means used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The construction of bridges of both control institutions recommends: standardization of bridges and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where reinforced reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">Her team spirit and informality belonged to the main emblems of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel control, auditors participated in their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report informs about the course and results of parallel inspections of funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The audits were focused on economics, efficiency and efficiency of expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel control was carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel controls took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and efficiency of the expenditure of approximately CZK 20 billion, including VAT (approximately 690 million €) on the border section of the D 8, which has number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">64 million € from European funds (ISPA) should be used from this amount as planned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to parallel control carried out together with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to approximately €670 million, and there will be 277 million € co-financed from European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – Central and southern part of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 motorway leads from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 motorway leads from the state border of the Czech Republic/SRN to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of control, the border sections of both motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side is so highway completed until Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D 8 motorway is not completed, because section 0805 in the length of 16.4 km through the Czech Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, the section 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem has a protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the forecast carried out in the Czech Republic in 2001, the D 8 intensity of operation 22 940 vehicles per day should be in 2008 on the border section No 0807 of the D 8 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the German forecast, the intensity of operation on the Czech border will be in 2010 about 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the joint state border by construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both countries participate in the construction of the bridge, so the inspection of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of parallel inspections carried out by both control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2006, both the highest audit institutions have acted close cooperation in the control of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction consists in ŘSD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to check this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have a comparative database needed to assess whether funds were used economically if it concerns the total level of bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to assure the efficiency of expenditure taking into account the main technical parameters of the highway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same driving quality on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After the preparatory negotiations, the presidents of both supreme audit institutions on the coordinated control of the D 8/A motorway were signed on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The joint working meeting of BRH and NKÚ auditors took place throughout 2006 in the interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The negotiations were addressed by current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology of controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, exchanging from the control of the construction of the border bridge and preparation of common reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">An important sign of cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on the comparison of technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the procurement procedure, the SAO prepared a methodology for controlling bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">Applicable legal standards for control in state administration differ in both countries in the manner of closure of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, both the highest audit institutions have prepared their own audit conclusions on their findings obtained during their inspections.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved during parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation will be terminated by signing the final communication in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in the contract from 2000 to the deadline for completion of the construction bridge by the possibility in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">Both sides agreed to postpone this date at the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">ŘSD worked as an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">SRN is financially involved in the construction of the bridge from 42,13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period until 1999 the ŘSD proposed that the border bridge had a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999 after agreement with its partners in Germany, the ŘSD agreed with the steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by a reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and subsequent ecological benefits of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">The comparative calculations performed by the ŘSD also stated that the coupled steel-concrete structure should be less expensive.</seg>
<seg id="81">In calculations, however, there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was stated in them that the new spinning steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the procurement of the order at the border bridge, ŘSD has committed serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It has not prepared a contractual documentation that would adequately describe the criteria for assessing and partial criteria for comparing offers.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the fact that the Commission for assessing and evaluating offers and CEO assessed the offer subjectively and problematic.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful applicant attacked the results of the custom procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation of the Office for the Protection of Competition led to the fact that the contract for the construction of the construction was signed later than originally expected.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the summer construction season 2004 after the evaluation of offers was wasted and the time reserved for the construction was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge for a shorter period, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The offered procedure included double assembly of the bridge superstructure, change in the construction of pillars and establishment and equipment of assembly areas.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was not able to provide a originally designed type of steel in the necessary term.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a price higher by about 4 million €, which had to be fully paid to ŘSD – enabled a shortening of the time to carry out corrosion protection, which subsequently allowed to shorten the total construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million, offered in the public tender, the total cost of the construction of the border bridge due to accelerated procedure and further modifications will increase considerably in financing.</seg>
<seg id="95">Shortened time reserved for construction works led to an increase in the price in the range of about 5.9 million €.</seg>
<seg id="96">At present, the amount of net costs is around 25.9 million €, without taking into account automatic price growth (to October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both supreme control institutions carried out an analysis of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was too high, and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on the methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, tunnels were compared to D 8 with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">On the A 17 motorway similar tunnels are not.</seg>
<seg id="102">When preparing this part of the audit, it was important to accurately identify relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">Both supreme audit institutions have set the following principles for the comparison of bridges prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (the VAT exports are different in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to changes); not to take into account the prices for the special basics of the bridge; read prices in CZK to € according to the European Central Bank rate applicable to 30. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of different structures (ocelo-concrete, pre-powered reinforced concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In an effort to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">The size of the bridge was also taken into account during these groups.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction were on both sides of the bridges of concrete (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, because the number of ensembles allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The audits were found that the prices for 2 concrete bridges on D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (his length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price on the m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the German bridges, the price dependence on the size of stronger than the Czech (see the graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on A 17 and four on D 8, whose price is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">To find these bridges, the method enabling the detection of atypical values in the set of numbers was used, both regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the bridge price on its size (for determining atypically expensive bridges is a standard distance from the regression curve upwards).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information about atypically high price of the above bridges should be considered only per indicator on which bridges need to be focused.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to derive the generally applicable conclusion, the causes of high price in each identified case should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One cause may be ineffective administrative measures, or also the requirements for environmental protection or other acceptable reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">Considering the fact that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German (see the table below), the negative dependence of the bridge price on its length could lead to the assumption that the Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges also support lower labour costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two possible causes of this state were identified during the joint negotiations:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are entered as separate orders.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such assignments allow the competition to participate in a small and medium-sized regional company.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic there are many bridges entered as part of the contract for part of the route of the motorway, which is a few kilometers long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such competitions because the order is too large for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic there is greater variability in bridge construction than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge structure decides long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is adopted at a time when ŘSD translates a zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, ŘSD selects the types of bridges from more variants, but in decision-making the economy plays a smaller role.</seg>
<seg id="130">The general conclusion of the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany would be possible to pronounce only on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would exceed the framework of this control event.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels it was found that the prices of tunnels on D 8 are twice as high as tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">Comparison of the main building-technical parameters of tunnels on D 8 with tunnels in Germany, however, showed no substantial difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, a small number of tunnels did not allow to do generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Purpose and efficiency of the Dresden motorway construction – Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the concept of the development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway should be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains should be acquired before the border section No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic takes the D 8 motorway within the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In programme No. 327 220 “Exhibition of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/SRN” two objectives of the motorway D 8 motorway were established:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection of Prague and Ústí nad Labem – national destination;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection of Prague and Berlin within the IVth Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin – Istanbul – an international target.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains should be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No. 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">Here it is necessary to add that the completion date is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction section of the head over the Czech Central Mountains is now an official zoning decision in the stage.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists attacked this decision by lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">The action is not competently decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">Therefore, it is not possible to exclude that the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the program documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006 the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the deadline for completion of the section 0805 for 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section of the national target – improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem was not achieved.</seg>
<seg id="155">ŘSD carried out the estimate of capital expenditure on the border section D 8 No 0807 and section 0805 via the Czech Central Mountains in 1999 – 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate of these capital expenditures included in investment costs is about 639 million € together on both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of economic assessment (EIRR = internal yield rate)</seg>
<seg id="158">All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section intensity of operation 18,000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section intensity of operation 22 000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All considered motorways and expressways open, both sections D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section intensity of operation 25,000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and section through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed on time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of control, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened in the original term.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above values of EIRR.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections without VAT, calculated as of 31. 12. 2005, there were 897 million €, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the cost level with which economic analysis worked in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that the section 0805 will be conducted in another, more expensive route, which would affect the above-mentioned boundary of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable during the intensity of operation at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 amounted to 22 940 vehicles, but the study solving the issue of mobile routes for missing section over the Czech Central Mountains counts on the intensity of operation of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which shifts the investment below the economic viability limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">At a higher load of mobile routes behind the missing section over the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion, thus increasing external costs with which it did not count on the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increasing the costs means that the so-called EIRR, which was supposed to have the construction of the border section D 8.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">Also in the construction of the A 17 motorway there was a similar crossing of costs as in the case of these two sections on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">Within the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for long-distance transport for 1992 the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany counted on the costs of CZK 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost and revenue ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">Meanwhile, however, the costs increased rapidly to about 670 million € and the cost ratio and revenues decreased more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to parallel control carried out together with the SAO BRH, the preparation and construction of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="179">BRH found that the appropriate approval state authority required the third section A 17 field tunnel, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the auditing operation, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German administration for the construction of roads that the tunnel is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">The result was to achieve savings that amounted only to construction costs of roughly 10 million € and €0.15 million on annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When assessing the first section A 17 BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">It proves the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the preparatory stage, the administration was not carried out for the construction of roads exploring the conditions of the rock subsoil in Dölzschen rocks, because the place was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was done only after the tunnel stamping machine crashed on the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests have shown that the rocks are more weathered inside than expected during the selection procedure.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures must be taken as anchoring, injections and protective networks against the fall of stones, which required about 3.3 million €.</seg>
<seg id="188">The headquarters of roads and motorways had to bear the costs not only for another extraordinary operation, such as security measures in Dölzschen rocks, but also measures that would not be needed if the construction project was first properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="189">The expenditure of this type includes the costs associated with interruption of construction operations (3.2 million €), further training of drilling workers (0.5 million €) and growing wages and expenditure on goods due to exceeding the project duration (7 million €).</seg>
<seg id="190">Exceeding costs thus amounted to roughly 10.7 million €, which did not correspond to any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">Based on the lessons obtained from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply a more strict management during its supervision over the work on the construction of roads.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Federal Ministry should give the headquarters of roads and motorways needed to stimulate the implementation of quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH received the control findings about the preparation, assignment and course of the construction bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both supreme control institutions have built a database of bridges and tunnels prices, which will be able to rely on future inspections.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main building-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and route of the D 8 motorway differ from the parameters A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">Auditors of both institutions of participating in cooperation have gained new experience, which can be used in further audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds intended for financing projects implemented under the Operational Programme of Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic – Polish Republic 2007–2013</seg>
<seg id="2">HOME</seg>
<seg id="3">The emerging community of Europe's population is the driving force of cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation, which is part of our lives of the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, let this community provide an introductory word to this common report of two supreme audit institutions adjacent to the countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">“185 million EU citizens (i.e. 37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually a few developed and marginal areas, often the remains of the darker parts of the history of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and further help the development of existing potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Programs cover various border regions: some cover seaside areas, other inland borders within the EU or the border shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries.”</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last seven years and a total of 5.7 billion will be allocated on them from the EU budget. EUR.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Programmes include the following activities: repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling trails and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, healthcare facilities, research centres, flood measures, etc., joint administration of natural locations or development of tourist destinations, development of joint services for locals, consultancy on employment issues, creating thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is provided under the condition that organizations from both sides of the border (e.g. regional authorities, universities or small and medium-sized enterprises) will join the implementation of projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the program itself ends.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funds are provided with the condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fills at least two of the following four characters: common preparation, joint implementation, common staff, joint financing.”</seg>
<seg id="16">As part of the partnership, tasks and responsibility for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of the project activities are clearly defined and divided into relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: a common choice of a partner's head, a joint preparation of the project and a application, a joint agreement on partnership signed by all partners, taking over the overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the head of the partner, the total payment of support accepts the leading partner and performs their transfer to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">The eligible projects implemented in the regions and Voivodeship adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">CONTROL AND ROZSAH CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme of Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic – Polish Republic 2007–2013 (OPPS ČR–POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">258 187 467 € were allocated to the implementation of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total sum contained a contribution from European funds (ERDF) in the total amount of 219 459 344 € (85%), which must be exhausted by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the drawdown of EU funds from the Operational Programme cross-border cooperation Czech Republic – Polish Republic 2007–2013 at the end of 2013 are listed in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement on cooperation of the highest audit institutions of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Polish Republic (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013 after previous mutual negotiations at the meeting of the head of the highest audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberen in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to examine whether the implementation of the Operational Programme takes place in accordance with the legal regulations and with binding programme documents or agreements whether the control and control system works reliably whether the objectives of the Operational Programme are achieved and whether selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions provided by the support.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation had a form of parallel control, during which the audit authorities were independently examined by topics whose content was discussed in advance together.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The control also included elements of performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">Selected topics were verified on the sample of projects for project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The result of the audits carried out was the audit conclusions published in the usual way by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Based on both control conclusions referred to in the Annex, this joint report was created.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1), which fall into the area of support 1.1 – Strengthening traffic availability and support area 2.2 – Support for tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the drawdown of funds from these two areas of support was more than 60% of funds paid by the recipients by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects throughout the OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to the control of the joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and NIK two more (all of the support areas 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid by the beneficiaries from the ERDF, which were controlled by the SAO and NIK, reached a total amount of 25 362 174 € (NKÚ) and 8 450 784 € (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited volume of funds represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries from the areas of support 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL FACILITIES</seg>
<seg id="39">Both inspections independently carried out the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of significance.</seg>
<seg id="40">Implementation of the OPPS CR–POL, including the functioning of the control and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited persons who have been part of the control and control system have taken steps leading to the restriction of the risk of incorrect use of funds and the use of the funds provided from the ERDF.</seg>
<seg id="42">The proof of efficiency of implemented projects within the Operational Programme is the high level of fulfilment of the set goals supported by the results of the social evaluation of the implementation of projects.</seg>
<seg id="43">SHRNUTÍ RESULTS CONTROLES</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of the control and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach enabled the control and control system OPPS ČR–POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the control body (Ministry for Regional Development of the Czech Republic), national coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development POL) and auditors (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodeship).</seg>
<seg id="46">The coordinated audit also enabled the evaluation of tasks and functions implemented by the joint technical secretariat and monitoring committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the control system, the control focused on activities carried out in connection with the setting and performance of the function of the control body and national coordinator, especially in connection with setting the objectives of the program and monitoring the achieved progress, evaluation activities and annual reports, assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, drawing of program funds and fulfilling the obligation to publish the correct, complete and up-to-date information about subsidies, as well as control activities of the control body, setting up the performance of activities and outputs from audits authorized by the audit entity and with the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance, at the same time was verified coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the relevant authorities in the field of risk analysis and the assembly of plans for inspections in the place of implementation of projects and the evaluation of project applications were assessed by independent evaluators.</seg>
<seg id="49">The verification of the control system included a review of administrative inspections and inspections carried out on the site that enabled approval e.g. deliveries of goods and co-financed services, competence of expenditure submitted to reimbursement and the compliance of the payment of these funds and related activities (or their parts) with national legislation and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant deficiencies were found to control the SAO in the field of publication of the correct, complete and current information on the subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">The risk of non-transparency of this process has been found in the evaluation and approval of projects.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other deficiencies were found in the field of monitoring monitoring indicators and in the system of reports of irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) assessed the control and control system implemented by the control body as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The discrepancies identified by NIK, which concerned the functioning of the control and control system in Poland in relation to the violation of applicable laws and rules, were not evaluated as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These inconsistencies had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a substantial impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified irregularities, NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The control did not prove the conflict between indicators and targets set out for individual projects and those defined by the operating program.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all audited projects, expected results were achieved, financed activities were implemented and indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operating programme were fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="60">The auditing conclusions are in accordance with the result of the survey of social evaluation of the implementation of projects described further in the text.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect, which the SAO and NIK paid attention to in their conclusions, is a limited possibility of objective evaluation of the performance of the expected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time on the objectives of the entire operating programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Audit Chamber's initiative took place a public opinion survey, which took place in the summer of 2013 in the place of realization of projects selected in the joint control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation was carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nyse (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">After agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2 820 respondents, both in the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners, as well as in the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey concerned mainly suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social functions of projects, including implemented investments.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents for individual projects is specified in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the response from the survey suggested that the overall social evaluation of the projects was good and the value of 4.8 point (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points) was achieved, meaning that the results of the projects were positively perceived mostly by respondents both with regard to the goals and according to other parameters referred to in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents, the examined projects were examined expressed in the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noticed a positive impact of investment on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, transport availability, tourist attractions, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and renewal of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, it indicated the overall evaluation of responses certain difference between the actual level of fulfilment of goals/parameters (real impact rate) and the level of expected respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in accordance with the opinions of the participants of panel discussions (target groups) carried out within the framework of NIK control on the Polish side, who pointed out the need for realization of projects and confirmed their positive acceptance of the public and the performance of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">For support recipients, the compliance of the material and time implementation of the project with schedule and content of the project application was examined, the performance of the set goals and the purpose of the project was verified, fulfilling binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, handling of the project's income, fulfilling the obligation of a separate accounting register of project transactions, compliance with the ban on financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of project partnership and compliance with its conditions, fulfilling compulsory publicity concerning the dissemination of awareness of sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of competence of project expenditure, picking suppliers and verifying the delivered performance on the basis of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of qualified SAO and NIK deficiencies as expenditure of an eligible financing from EU funds was found in the amount of 85 094 €.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount exceeded the specified level of significance related to the overall controlled volume of funds for the project sample.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the founding inconsistencies, the SAO and NIK assessed the implementation of selected projects of beneficiaries positively.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the obligations arising from the conditions of support for the recipient were properly fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds intended for implementation of audited projects were spent in accordance with EU and national law regulations.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nevertheless, in seven of the eight recipients of support controlled by NIK, irregularities in the performance of material and financial obligations were found.</seg>
<seg id="81">It was individual cases of non-systemic nature and concerned particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and violation of rules for public procurement, which had no impact on the selection of a supplier or delivery of contractually agreed work.</seg>
<seg id="82">Only in one of all projects controlled by NIK can be detected inconsistency that concerned not fulfilling the obligation in the field of reporting, evaluated as an unused expenditure in the amount of 43 003 PLN (of which 8 231 € financed from the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other hand, the SAO identified the SAO in three of the 19 audited projects did not cause an eligible expenditure of 2 098 053 CZK (of which 76 863 € financed from the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Inconsistencies included non-delivery of paid material and work or expenditure for the modernization of the property owned by the person who did not have a binding on the project or as a recipient of support, nor as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">CANCELLATION</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system especially with regard to the consistent determination of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the operational programme priority axis.</seg>
<seg id="87">Generally, it is also necessary to strive to determine such indicators at the level of the program and projects that allow more reliable verification of the performance of the specified impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Notes and recommendations arising from checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate control conclusions of the SAO and NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICED</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was prepared in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the presidents of the highest audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Polish Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement for construction work and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Common Report on Parallel Control carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement for goods and services of public contractors is very important both for state and private sphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and economically and to ensure correct and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU) the public procurement is a key factor for the success of a single economic space.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its regulations, the EU set limits in which the public contract must meet certain requirements to guarantee a wide and unlimited competitive environment throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Czech Republic and Germany have already done.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public procurement, which are values below the EU limits, the regulation of their entry into the competence of individual countries remains.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, public procurement is susceptible to corruption with subsequent high damage potential.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, the contractors are obliged to accept reasonable measures in their procurement procedures for preventing corruption and incorrect favors (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to carry out parallel inspections in the field of procurement proceedings and prevention of corruption for land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The audits also included procurement under European limits in order to affect corruption prevention area.</seg>
<seg id="16">The auditing findings of both supreme audit institutions are summarized in a joint report, which is among other things intended for international organisations such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Areas of control and controlled institution</seg>
<seg id="18">The evaluation of BRH is based on the platforms of the above mentioned areas, which were carried out in German construction administrations responsible for federal transport and ground structures from 2011 to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, motorways and extensive land construction projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">BRH included in the evaluation and findings from previous inspections.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO evaluation is based on inspections carried out during 2008 to 2012, which were focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospital, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the procurement of federal public procurement is usually carried out by earthly construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the responsibility of the state institution for road and railway construction is responsible for entering public procurement in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of land construction, public procurement is carried out by entities that are recipients of budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, external experts are also used in individual stages of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">When evaluating, the differences in legislation relating to public procurement and the peculiarities of the construction industry in both countries must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the course of European procurement proceedings is governed by laws and sublegal standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">The procurement procedure limited only to Germany is governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details regarding the requirements of European procurement law and corruption prevention are anchored in the so-called federal government procurement manuals in which the requirements are divorced or formulated into larger details with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legal regulations relating to orders with a value of above and under European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement right has undergone substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened space for greater competition and limited opportunities for corruption during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">Regarding European procurement procedures, it is necessary to apply especially open and narrower management in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts under the European limit are awarded in accordance with national regulations (public call for participation in the competition, limited call for participation, meeting proceedings), but these are practically identical to the above conditions for European procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterized by the principle of preference of open proceedings (where interested in a European scale) and public calls to participate (only in the case of national proceedings).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open proceedings and when prompting to participate in the competition, the offer may be submitted by any interested parties.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of the German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved mainly by dividing the total public contract into a business specific parts and division into partial orders.</seg>
<seg id="42">By entering orders divided into these parts, the chances of participating in the management of the greatest amount of applicants are given.</seg>
<seg id="43">The mentioned two characteristics of the German procurement law represent a proven tool for obtaining a good value for money in time.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic it is necessary to apply the conditions of European proceedings even in cases of public procurement with the value under the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is simplified sublimit control, where the contractor can use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, the Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the order must be entered in order to ensure the competition and achieve the advantageous price.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current Czech legislation allows the contractors to choose between open proceedings and narrower management.</seg>
<seg id="49">85 000 construction companies are registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 has 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of orders of contractors for public work and the share of individual types of proceedings in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany reached amount 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">CZK, which 1 138 billion. CZK (15%) amounted to the share of public procurement, which in addition to the orders granted by the Federal Government contained orders granted by individual federal states and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of federal road and ground construction (without rail construction and water construction) amounted to CZK 212,5 billion. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal orders was the following: 80.7% of open management and public calls; 12.7% narrower management and narrow challenges;</seg>
<seg id="55">6.6% meeting proceedings and direct procurement; 33,2% is the proportion of European procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction orders in the Czech Republic in 2011 reached 118,6 billion. CZK , which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 he reached the value of 194,0 billion. CZK, which was 37% of the total volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement procedure types in 2011: 65.1% open management; 14.3% narrower management; 9.5% of meeting proceedings; 8.4% simplified management on sublimit orders; 2.7% other proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="59">The data include all public procurement for deliveries, services and construction works entered by public contractors in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The above-mentioned numbers show that: parallel inspections in both countries were focused on a substantial part of public procurement proceedings; the prevention of corruption, which must be taken into account during procurement proceedings, has a significant financial impact; open importance. procurement proceduresyn have a key meaning.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel inspections of European orders for construction work with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The audits were focused on comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Furthermore, the key findings are specified:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Directive on Public Procurement was transposed into national rights of both countries (points 1st and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">The prevention of corruption is not only the objective of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries that partly differ in the focus and in detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, it is the basic requirement that must meet the procurement documentation, including all information necessary for the preparation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Specification must be neutral and must not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">Procurement documents in Germany are mostly fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic there is a problem of insufficient definition of the subject of the order.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, the division of orders for parts is required, where it is only possible to support the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the BRH findings, this requirement is observed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO audits demonstrated that a very large public work in the field of road constructions is entered in the Czech Republic without being divided into parts or divided are, but only to a volumetric very important part. This method can disrupt competition and lead to restrictions only on several large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">This restriction of market potential may result in a significant increase in costs and induce risk of non-seasonal price negotiations and inadmissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legal regulation in both countries allows to enter other construction works under certain conditions under certain conditions, if this need arises only after the contract is concluded (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for correct determination of the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to applicable regulations, the contractors may arbitrarily determine one of the open procurement procedures, open proceedings or narrower management in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="78">German regulations in the procurement and budgetary law prevail over open proceedings both for European tenders and national, known as public calls to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a greater circuit of applicants to present the offer and also reduce the risk of corruption because it makes it difficult for unlawful arrangements of prices between interested parties.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results in the field of value for money are achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large orders, whose estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set out in the EU, the auditing orderers always announced the European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct determination of the expected value of the order plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases for objective determination of the price of public works are used, in which the values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction, but are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When entering the contract for construction work according to European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish preliminary information and notifications of commencement of the procurement procedure due to strengthening the competition by being able to prepare them for time on the submission of bids.</seg>
<seg id="87">As and roules, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">When selecting applicants for participation in a narrower procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of handling.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be high enough to guarantee a real competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">Selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Above the EU requirements, contractors should be alternated in both countries as often as possible by those interested in the selection of suppliers to participate in the management.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, they are partly very detailed requirements for preventing the risks of handling.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, these requirements did not follow these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the decision was not always credible (point 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, the contractors must ensure that all interested parties who want to present the offer received the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between these interested parties and between them and the third parties involved in the preparation of specifications must be prevented as much as possible in order not to restrict the competition in the form of illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the relevant measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, controlled German orderers in several cases did not meet the requirement (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross control and transparency must be applied when opening the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">Requirements for labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality of offers have space for handling and in Germany are particularly detailed.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audits in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Assessment and evaluation of offers is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The competent German measures are more complex, but not always controlled by the audited order.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, the contractors handed over their offers to third parties to see without their prior assessment without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">The intended award must be the participants due to the legal protection enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the procurement procedure was not always complete or completely credible in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the requirements for transparency applied at the European level were not always adequately observed in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="113">Moreover, some found deficiencies decreased preventive anti-corruption function of documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Submitters in both countries usually fulfilled their notification obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a directive on coordination of procedures for public procurement for public work, deliveries and services in order to ensure free movement of goods and services and directive on coordination of legal and administrative regulations relating to the review procedure in public procurement for deliveries and public procurement for construction work (directional proceedings), and these two directives should be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">General procurement principles of the EU include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or prohibition of discrimination; a request for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, the EU's procurement principles include the Coordination of Procedures in Public Procurement in addition, including provisions on construction projects whose total estimated value reaches or exceeds €5 million.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the content of procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; disclosure of certain information before, during and after the procedure; compliance with the deadline for acceptance of offers; qualification requirements that may be required after applicants; the selection criteria of the most suitable offer.</seg>
<seg id="121">Legal protection of applicants is governed by a directive on review proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="122">In case of a potential violation of the procurement law, applicants may have a review of the client's decision according to review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries have transposed EU requirements to national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">Meaning of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="126">In any of both countries there is no legal definition, what actually corruption means.</seg>
<seg id="127">Generally, corruption is understood as abuse of personal (confidential) position for its own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is incited by persons who will benefit from the benefit.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">According to estimates, the total damage related to corruption is 5% of the world's economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="131">For EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of EU economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="132">If public procurement is involved in the order, the Convention restricting the competition or enabling dishonest negotiations can weaken trust in integrity, the ability and overall work of public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, the prevention of corruption is a fundamental task of the contractors.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practice and procedures must be checked especially in the areas of particularly susceptible to corruption in order to accept adequate measures to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Receiving preventive measures and implementing effective inspections can significantly reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">The procurement of orders for construction works is usually considered an area particularly susceptible to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures in the field of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable according to criminal and labour law, which is particularly related to active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German Federal Government issued a manual with recommendations relating to the prevention of corruption in the federal administration and according to which they are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis of the following principles: the preference of open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; the planning department, procurement and accounting phase; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">Moreover, further measures having preventive effect against corruption have become part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant federal Ministry of Information Technology supporting the system for monitoring orders for the construction of federal roads introduced.</seg>
<seg id="142">With this system, data can be as estimated costs, the total value of the order and involvement of private projection offices fully recorded and analyzed in order to determine the possible irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted according to criminal law, the level of labour or civil law is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="144">Legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and prohibition of any discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and realization) is the most important part of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="145">The anti-corruption measures in this area were established by the government in the “Government of the Government in the fight against corruption for the period 2011 to 2012”, which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of the measures mentioned was incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: reducing the limits for small-scale orders; the obligation of preliminary notification by the client, including the justification of the order; the prohibition of limiting the number of applicants in a narrower management and cancellation of general possibilities limit the number of applicants by draw; the obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish real and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of checks related to subsequent phases of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documentation</seg>
<seg id="150">The procurement documents must contain all the information necessary to prepare their offers in a proper form.</seg>
<seg id="151">The documentation must in particular allow the offer price to be processed.</seg>
<seg id="152">To make it possible, the applicants may not be exposed to risks with which they could not count.</seg>
<seg id="153">The procurement documentation contains mainly specifications, as well as requirements for proving the qualification of applicants and criteria for selecting the most advantageous offer.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="155">The European law contains especially requirements for technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Specification must restrict the competition to the smallest extent and all those interested must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">Specification must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific specific products are permissible in a very limited scale in the procurement documentation.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of corruption prevention is that the procurement documentation does not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Documentation should also avoid ambiguity or inaccurate data that create space for speculation and for handling the evaluation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed the EU's legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that the specifications are given generally without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">Specification must precisely define the required deliveries and services and state the numbers of units of work and deliveries in detail.</seg>
<seg id="166">In common cases, prices should be stated according to the units of work or deliveries (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Define the required work in terms of their functionality is permissible only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule applies that the specification needs to be elaborated completely and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain a exact amount and must not include work and deliveries whose necessity is not quite obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payment in the form of flat-rate amounts or according to the worked time must be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documentation must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">Specification must allow each applicant to prepare their offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The call for filing the offer must be published only when the procurement documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to enter construction contracts for parts for enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contractor can divide the public contract into several separate parts if it admits the nature of the subject such order.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rules of division of construction works on parts is required, either quantitatively (partial delivery), or according to special perspectives (specialized parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows participation in the competition and small and medium-sized entities, increasing the number of potential applicants and makes it difficult to fix prices.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of entry is usually considered the most suitable in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, procurement documents must contain evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thus the applicant should be comprehensively and in an exhaustive way informed about the criteria according to which his offer will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement for placing the evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European calls to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include the evaluation criteria only to the order record, which is the internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the procurement documents are prepared by authorized independent experts, German regulations require any information that would help identify specific stakeholders, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other inadmissible competitive benefits thanks to contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also why independent experts must not publish documents regarding tenders and allow their accessibility to examine.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contract is the only contact point for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic currently does not have similar provisions.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, it will arise almost always after the conclusion of the original contract or modification of existing works.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Legislation of both countries allows you to enter a contract for multiple work into a certain limit of the same supplier without having to publish and perform new procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of multilayer according to European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of the original value of the order.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the work must be necessary and must have the nature of a special component of the main order.</seg>
<seg id="193">A stricter limit of 20% is applied for the assignment in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="194">This can bring the risk of a larger time delay in the implementation of the order and any incorporation of a new entity into a already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">If the contract for multilayer is granted to the supplier of the original order, German law contains provisions that prevent the suppliers of arbitrary increase in the price of modified work or multi-turning.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be carried out taking into account the prices agreed in the original order.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to multi-turning during construction, less work can occur, i.e. work that was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, there is no less work and multilayer to compensate each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product neutral call to submit an offer</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, the specification appealed to national technical requirements or standards, which were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specification contained the data requiring a certain trademark, e.g. for the system of resistance to public inscriptions, to prevent water penetration or against noise cladding, although it was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications divided into items</seg>
<seg id="206">BRH did not notice even in a single case checking the procurement procedures of the disagreement with general requirements for the call to submit an offer for deliveries and services according to quantity specifications divided into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completion of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most audited cases, tender documents were not elaborated before the announcement of the call for bids.</seg>
<seg id="209">In different cases, however, it was necessary to modify documents during the procurement procedure when the changes in items or in the time schedule must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, the procurement documentation contained the work and delivery, whose need was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One procurement documentation for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Contract division and criteria for assigning the order</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification did not occur on the part.</seg>
<seg id="214">BRH did not find any deficiencies for the criteria for evaluating bids before entering the order.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of names of authorized independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">In many documents, interested authorised experts were listed.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names were introduced on the opening pages of documents or on plans or enclosed opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the client also called on the applicant to contact the procurement procedure of the specified architect with his questions for the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">These cases were found mainly in the procurement documentation, where the processing of specifications was entrusted with self-employed experts.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contractors stated that they do not have sufficient personnel capacity to detailed checking the procurement documentation.</seg>
<seg id="221">SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product neutral call to submit an offer</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 flats, the link was directly to a specific manufacturer and brand of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contractor did not allow the use of other similar types of products or did not justify why it requires the delivery of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of high school procurement documents, it contained links to specific business companies and a specific designation of products.</seg>
<seg id="226">General overview of specifications and partial specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of some industrial zones of the orderer in the procurement documentation, the number and type of required work, deliveries or services in the dispensing statement were unambiguously and determined for each building as a specific unit only a built-in space in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completion of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for a public contract during the construction of the road circuit, the procurement documentation for narrower management was changed four times from August to September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">The reason for the changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the order and by changing the technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">In the construction of social buildings, the procurement documentation had defects that forced the formation of multi-turns (the exact focus was missing, a sufficient building technical survey was not carried out, drawings were missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">In the procurement documentation for the construction of a large library, the interior elements were only descriptive, without specification of qualitative requirements for products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The delivery of equipment of the building interior provided subcontractors who bought some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for entering the order</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, it is not obliged to enter a contract for parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">From the analysis of three large road constructions during the construction of the road circuit, it resulted that during their entry in the open proceedings after parts (separably after selected buildings) it was possible to achieve savings of CZK 790 million from the price of the public procurement 15 508 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, when entering six building buildings as a separate part of the public contract, a savings of 62.5 million million could be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">CZK, i.e. 25 % z kontrahované ceny a při zadání 20 mostů jako samostatné části veřejné zakázky mohlo být dosaženo úspory 287,8 mil. CZK, i.e. also 25%.</seg>
<seg id="239">During the construction of roads in the procurement documentation, the client set the qualification criteria that restricted the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the procurement conditions of the open proceedings on the supplier at one construction of the motorway construction contract, i.e. the supplier's practice consisting in the implementation of at least three road constructions on the financial volume of each more than CZK 700 million, completed or commissioned over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of buildings above CZK 700 million in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the delivery of another motorway construction in open proceedings included six independent buildings where the contract required a minimum annual volume of construction works in the last three years of 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 orders for a total of 13.2 billion. CZK were only two or even one applicant.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that the restriction of market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Area of multi-timbered</seg>
<seg id="247">During the construction of the road circuit, the contract did not close the contract and the multilayer did not enter any of the procedures referred to in the Act under the construction of the road circuit.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of pre-approved multi-turns in one case amounted to CZK 1,591,4 million excluding VAT (exciting by 21%) and in the second case 4 135,8 million CZK excluding VAT (cancellation of 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The cause of the multi- ambiguous definition of the quantity and the kind of the required work was mainly.</seg>
<seg id="250">For the construction of the university of the contract, the contractor does not include some work and deliveries for the procurement documentation, whose necessities for completion and approval of the construction already knew when entering the order.</seg>
<seg id="251">These work and deliveries concluded amendments to the contract for the work with the contractor of the construction with an increase in the price, in the meeting proceedings without publication, although the volume of multi-turn exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original order.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the judicial palace, the contracter reserved the right to enter additional work without the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracter increased the scope of the contract for CZK 50.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices of additional works set out without the competition were significantly higher than the comparable work carried out by the same supplier.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">The SAO found out that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of the four-current motorway in the Czech Republic are CZK 355.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to the long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average costs in Germany are a kilometre section of the four-current motorway 260.0 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a highway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">Legal provisions on procurement documents are almost identical in both countries and are in accordance with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure complete and equal competition and prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">Specification must be accurate enough to be allowed to calculate costs and prepare their offers.</seg>
<seg id="263">In addition, this requirement restricts space for speculation and the orderer is protected against the need to enter more work.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on the procurement documentation are supplemented with other rules, which have even more reduce the possibilities for limiting competition and for the implementation of handling.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this type in the Czech Republic, there is a higher transparency of the publication of the procurement criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">The specification requirements are usually met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, deficiencies were found that could lead to restriction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">At the same time, the valid rule in Germany requiring the division of bulky construction projects into parts seems suitable for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic the granting of orders for a volumetric extensive projects without entering after parts or division into a volumetric large part of the interest of those interested in a small number of large suppliers can be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="270">The result of a strict requirement for the references of the applicant, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of applicants for road construction work, is the fact that public procurement is granted only to a small circle of applicants, and small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">The limited number of applicants also increases the risk of fixing prices and other illegal conventions.</seg>
<seg id="272">Regarding the entry of additional orders for multi-work or modified work and their reimbursement, regulatory approaches in both countries are different.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of additional works according to the European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, multiple work may be entered without the procurement procedure and its notification.</seg>
<seg id="274">A stricter limit of 20% applies in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit is 20% exceeded, multi-work must be entered on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By doing work on part, the restriction of competition and subsequent unfortunate consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with respect to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">Determination of the type of procurement procedure defines the client's circle of potential suppliers who will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The client can leave the range of potential suppliers unlimited, or can limit the range according to the specified criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of large project work, whose value reaches or exceeds the limits set out in the EU, European procurement proceedings must be guided.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="285">When selecting the type of management, the contract must meet especially the requirements of European law concerning the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required construction work is achieved or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million (125 million CZK), the open or limited procurement procedure at the European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, there is a permissible acting or competition dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="288">If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contractor may deviate from the European procurement procedure by announcing the national proceedings if the total value of the relevant part is below 1.0 million € (25 million CZK) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimate of the entire order.</seg>
<seg id="289">To share a construction project or deliberately estimate its costs too low with the intention of avoiding fundamental obligations to write down European procurement proceedings is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">The choice of the type of management is very important for the prevention of corruption because the limitations of competition significantly increases the risk of handling.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification of the selected type of management is an important part of the documentation of the procurement procedure, especially in relation to the obligation of the application of the European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have implemented legal requirements of the EU for the procurement procedure and limits to their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic introduced the principle of equal validity of open and narrower proceedings and for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and narrower management can always be selected, while other types of control are allowed only when fulfilling the statutory conditions.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike Czech adjustments, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and corruption prevention principles prefers open proceedings or public calls to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including limited management, are only permissible only exceptionally if it allows legislation.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions must be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference of open management is to guarantee that the limitations of competition are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity to manipulate (pre-selected specific applicants) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is the central point of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimate of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for the decision on the corresponding type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the costs of land construction projects, the contractors in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrative and other organizations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were assembled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of buildings, construction units, building parts and partial construction work.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such standard costs of costs, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or construction work.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrative in Germany has a similar database for road constructions.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, it is expected that the database will be extended at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Submitters in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or an average price of comparable buildings for determining the expected costs of public procurement for land constructions.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the cost of the costs is based on the estimation of the entity that finances the project or is based on the value of resources available to this entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures for standardization are so far in the initial phase.</seg>
<seg id="312">Based on the programme of the fight against corruption for the period 2011 to 2012 the relevant ministries have a database of usual prices of standardized commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by the new regulation proving to determine the subject of the contract in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The price system should serve as a set of information on building and assembly works, materials and products and other data for the purpose of calculating the necessary costs and for determining unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport issued normative prices for transport constructions for their control, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended for determining the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in other stages of preparation of construction works.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main control findings BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">Controls of the contractors mostly entered orders in an open proceedings or in the form of a public call for participation and thus were in accordance with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of public competitions in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of land construction was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the road construction, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases it was not sufficiently justified by the use of non-public competition.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of the BRH area, it found out on the basis of information collected from more than 16,000 proceedings that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public proceedings and public challenge and limited proceedings also increase the risk of handling and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, the offer prices in limited management and meeting proceedings by 6% to 10% higher than in public proceedings were offered.</seg>
<seg id="326">The parallel study of the Ministry of Construction and the Earth's Audit Court confirmed the differences worth money obtained in public and limited proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="327">The study of the Ministry of Construction even discovered that prices in limited proceedings were twice higher than prices in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated at more than 5 million € (125 million CZK), audited contractors usually prepared procurement plans in which they stated which work will be entered in the European procurement procedure and which in national proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of works entered according to European rules has always exceeded 80% of the total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">The case was not recorded bypassing the requirement for European proceedings in the form of excessively low estimation of costs.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases, the minimum share for pan-European proceedings was not achieved due to the calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the execution of the work, some contractors have changed the plan of allocation of orders in an illegal way.</seg>
<seg id="334">These changes did not justify and did not prove that the minimum proportion of European proceedings was subsequently followed.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of European proceedings according to the accounts for the project was usually lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected values of construction projects were exceeded by European limits, the contractors did not use European proceedings on all individual partial parts of the value exceeding CZK 1 million (25 million CZK).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they granted the relevant orders based on the national proceedings without specifying the strong reasons for the need to deviate from the request.</seg>
<seg id="338">SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of the type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. the construction of the road section, equipment for a large sporting event and construction of flats) the orderer divided one project into several parts, although these sub-projects were the same or similar character.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division has decreased the expected value of the order and the order has been entered in less demanding regime or even outside the law of the law.</seg>
<seg id="342">Calculation methods of the expected price</seg>
<seg id="343">The price standards valid for road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices listed in the completed proceedings, which were burdened with non-economic and excessive profit of suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price standards.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport has to update standards in relation not only to prices from the past, but also compared to other comparable markets and prices.</seg>
<seg id="347">The estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by architects or from the investor's estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price differed considerably from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price of the construction of a large library was twice higher than the contractual price, but during the implementation it increased by CZK 54 million, i.e. by 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly to the construction of the depository of this library, the contractual price was 33% lower than the price expected.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased during the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">For the construction of a large library it was CZK 400 million, i.e. by 22%. In the construction of the judicial palace, the actual price during the construction of the construction increased disproportionately (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (only 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and respect for the European limits into their national legislation, so the relevant national regulation of both countries is almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public proceedings in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the narrower procurement procedure, public proceedings or public call for the participation of the possibility of a larger number of competitors will be attended by the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of offers that guarantee the best effect of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened because the circuit of applicants is not limited by the decisions of pre-accepted entertainer, which gives space to manipulate and fix prices between applicants.</seg>
<seg id="359">The study confirmed the benefits of German provisions on the preference of open proceedings or public calls to participate.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contractors to enter orders in an open or narrower management.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the last legal regulation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban to restrict the number of applicants in narrower proceedings for public contractors.</seg>
<seg id="362">The narrower steering is now very close to the open control.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contract is largely filled with the requirement of preference of open proceedings or public calls to participate in the competition, while some projects were divided in the Czech Republic contrary to the law in order to circumvent the requirement for the selection of the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects implemented in Germany, the European limits were not respected, resulting in an failure to achieve a minimum share in European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, a satisfactory system has not yet been introduced to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction work and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">In cases where it is on the spot, the contractors should ensure that the requirements for selecting the type of procurement procedure and the volume of orders granted in European proceedings are met, or should create such conditions that are necessary to enable the correct calculation of the expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and announcement of proceedings</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where orders are granted within the framework of European proceedings, the contract must publish a report on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and announcement of the procurement procedure are an important base for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="371">Through preliminary announcements, the client must specify the basic specifications of the intended projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary announcements are required in case of projects where the estimate of total costs is equal to or greater than the European limit, and when the contract wishes to shorten the deadline for submitting offers in individual procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contract is obliged to publish a notification of the procurement procedure with detailed information for all public procurement that require European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information is binding after publication for the client.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notification must contain specifications, deadlines for managing and completing the order, special requirements and selection criteria and their weight.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common dictionary for public procurement must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and notifications of the contract are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the client.</seg>
<seg id="378">Due to preventing discrimination against foreign applicants, they do not have a national level notifications contain any additional information and should not be published before submitting the notification of the Office for the publication of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="379">Uncomplete or inaccurate information in the preliminary notice may violate the competition or even relieve handling.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and announcements of procurement proceedings to their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notification must also be published in the case of orders where European proceedings are not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedure must not be initiated before one month after submitting a preliminary notification.</seg>
<seg id="386">From the publication of preliminary information, it may only be abandoned in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where European proceedings are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national proceedings, public call must be published on the federal government website, and when appropriate, even in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In case of limited proceedings without the competition of participants, the announcement must be published if the estimated price of the contract is equal or higher than CZK 25,000 (625 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary announcements must explain all the planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement due to the amount of small orders in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">The division of projects into a smaller part is not so common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary announcements</seg>
<seg id="396">The contractors published a preliminary announcement of projects that included work that should be entered in European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open proceedings, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the preliminary notification and the sending of a notification of the contract was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other shortened management of the annual period valid for preliminary information expired and should be restored.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the preliminary announcement did not indicate the expected distribution of construction works on multiple parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Announcement of the launch of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="401">Some announcements contained codes from a common dictionary that departed from the content of preliminary announcement or exactly did not specify work to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="402">In rare cases, the national level notifications included more information, e.g. regarding the terms of performance, or were published before the announcement in the Official Journal of the EU was published.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One orderer hired an external company to publish a national announcement.</seg>
<seg id="405">She published a notification on her platform whose use was charged.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contract did not check if this company must comply with the request to send a notification to the free internet government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of the announcement was actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">SAO</seg>
<seg id="409">Announcement of the launch of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="410">During the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracter did not specify the criteria according to which the reduction of a large number of offers for the evaluation procedure will be carried out in the notification of the narrower procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">Method of choice (reduction) of offers for evaluation was not able to document the contract.</seg>
<seg id="412">Reduction of the number of offers allowed previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the construction of the road circuit, the client did not limit in the announcement of the commencement of a narrower procedure even in the qualification documentation of the value according to which it will assess the peace of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of applicants who will be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The client assessed the fulfilment of the qualification so that all six interested parties fulfilled it, but one of them excluded it with the fact that it fulfilled up to the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The client's procedure was not transparent, because he did not publish information in advance about what will be assessed and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of challenges</seg>
<seg id="417">For building modifications in the former military departments of the contractor in conflict with the law not published a written call for bids.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information process with preliminary information and disclosure of the commencement announcement is an important tool to meet the requirements for transparency and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="420">By expanding the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic, the national procurement proceedings and strengthening this obligation in Germany have increased the transparency of procurement proceedings and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in limited procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Compared to the open management, they do not allow limited procurement procedures to participate in all potential applicants who are interested.</seg>
<seg id="423">In limited proceedings, the contracter first selects potential suppliers who will be asked to submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow limiting the number of applicants in European limited proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, the limited proceedings require at least five applicants who will be asked to present the offer, and in case of acting proceedings with the publication, at least three potential applicants must be asked.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited applicants must be broad enough to guarantee the actual competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">Selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential applicants who will be asked is very susceptible to handling, e.g. preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition for several applicants can relieve their secret agreement.</seg>
<seg id="431">It has a negative impact on the result of the management.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contract must take measures to prevent manipulation and make sure it has an effective control to make this management transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for the selection of applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, the contractors should change the applicants who call on the offer.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permissible to restrict the competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Submitters must document and justify the selection of applicants and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, it is required to call on at least three applicants in case of limited management and several suitable applicants in case of acting proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except for two cases of new Czech regulations, they do not allow to limit the number of applicants addressed in the event of a narrower and meeting proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, when selecting applicants, it is necessary to respect the “six of four eyes”.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one employee proposes their list, others must modify this proposal substantially, e.g. by checking the proposed applicant or by achieving another.</seg>
<seg id="444">It should prevent the situation where the individual can definitively determine the circle of applicants who participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="445">If such provision is not introduced, the far-reaching illegal agreement between the participants is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of applicants who will be asked to present the offer must be confidential and must not be betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="447">This is committed to the authorised independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measures in the Czech Republic, nor measures for confidential treatment of the list of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German provisions, the candidates of external society shall not be determined, but they may give proposals to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of interested parties</seg>
<seg id="454">In addition to several cases, the requirement for addressing the minimum number of applicants was fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="455">The analysis of almost 7,000 assignments to the construction with a value to the national limit showed that in case of limited management of the contractors, they called on average 6.6 potential applicants and in case of direct acting proceedings on average 4.4 applicants.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially in the field of building construction, the contractors did not change the circle of addressed applicants, because they had good experience with those who have previously cooperated.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contractors argued that in the case of non-public proceedings they should guarantee that the applicants would appeal to whose suitability they had already preceded in advance.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restriction, the circle of applicants in a non-public proceedings included a larger part of regional applicants than in the case of public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contractors explained this to the low amount of orders compared to public proceedings and high travel costs for potential applicants.</seg>
<seg id="462">Principles of cross control and proposals separately gaining experts</seg>
<seg id="463">The contractors usually ignored the obligation to change the list of applicants designed separately by self-employed experts.</seg>
<seg id="464">They argued in particular the lack of personnel, time pressure or the corresponding knowledge of the appropriate applicant.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases from the records, it was not evident who proposed the applicant who was asked to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="466">The control of some samples showed that the list of potential applicants was created separately by self-employed experts and the client was admitted without any change.</seg>
<seg id="467">The contractors did not differ sufficiently from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of treatment of lists of potential applicants</seg>
<seg id="469">One client was led by a list of applicants for invitation to the procurement procedure in the database to which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed manipulation or unauthorized disclosure of the names of anticipated or received applicants who could then agree on the price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation stated reasons for selecting applicants only in several cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for the selection of applicants</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the road circuit, the applicants did not have information about what will be assessed from their qualification data and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">The event related to the development and modernization of waterways and ports in the announcement of the procurement procedure for participation in the narrower proceedings was not determined by the criteria of limiting the number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight applicants met the qualification prerequisites, but the number of which the contract was limited by participation in the procurement procedure was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then carried out a selection of applicants using a random selection method – draw, which was legal at that time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should be specified as a criterion already in the procurement procedure notification.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">Considering the high risk of handling in the selection of the winning applicant in limited procurement procedures, both countries introduced a special measure to prevent unauthorized restriction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules restrict such opportunities to manipulations using the so-called cross control (the principle of four eyes), using the preservation of the confidential character of the list of applicants and the prohibition of banning proposals for the selection of applicants by external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules are aimed at the potential restriction in order to prevent the manipulation of the unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit found that part of the aforementioned rules were not sufficient to adequately and that inadmissible restriction of the circle of interested parties was not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contractors are obliged to completely eliminate the aforementioned deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of bids</seg>

<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle that tender documents, based on the potential suppliers of their offer, must always be sent by the client.</seg>
<seg id="496">The design offices, which are interested in the management, should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contract must make sure that all candidates received the same information during this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>

<seg id="502">Offers sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">electronically submitted offers must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the orderer can entrust the insured supplier of external services by printing and sending documentation, while their employees must be committed to adhering to confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the received offers must be marked with the date of receipt and directly transmitted in the original state (sealed) by an official, which is entrusted with their storage.</seg>
<seg id="507">This employee must not be interested in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">The received offers must be locked up to the opening date of the envelope.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers are marked by the serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contract is issued a report with the competition data, including the number of the offer and information about the preparation of the offer and its receipt.</seg>

<seg id="519">For the part of the procurement documents regarding the querying and obtaining information, the contract did not proceed under the rules for separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">In conflict with the relevant regulations, he often did not specify the names of his contact staff in the documentation, but rather the workers of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some announcements during the procurement procedure even contained the names of companies or self-employed persons who participated in the preparation of procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, the applicants who hired questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>

<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts is admitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Members of the Commission may be authorized to discuss and in subsequent stages of proceedings, i.e. evaluation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, opening the envelopes takes place in the presence of a leading and writer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The head must be an employee of the client.</seg>
<seg id="564">The supervisor and in the case of ground construction and the writer shall not be the participants of the preparatory phase (creation of procurement documents), shall not decide on granting the contract and shall not be members in the subsequent processing ( Regulation) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require enrolment from opening envelopes to include not only bid prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) signs, e.g. damaged envelopes when receiving or late received offer.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to offering prices and data on the language of the offer and signature authorization of the applicant, must be in the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require all parts of the open envelopes to be labelled to prevent subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Offers, usually marked in the form of perforation with the date of the date, must be held after the opening of the envelopes as confidential (the same) and may only be made available to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no similar measures in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If the only offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be open and the applicant must be notified immediately.</seg>
<seg id="571">In Germany, they do not have this modification, and if the only offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Principles of cross control</seg>
<seg id="575">During opening the envelopes of the orderers followed the principle of four eyes.</seg>
<seg id="576">They were always present leaders and a writer who was not intended for other roles.</seg>
<seg id="577">In rare cases, however, in small meeting proceedings of a natural person opened offers that were sent to them, without the participation of the client.</seg>
<seg id="578">Progress of envelope opening</seg>
<seg id="579">The signs from opening the envelopes were not always the course.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, the offer was not marked late and in some cases the signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Labelling of received offers</seg>
<seg id="582">The contractors identified the bids of perforation with the date, which was in accordance with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Some of them identified the offer incorrectly in the past, but after the BRH notice they changed practice.</seg>

<seg id="586">Deadline for delivery of offers</seg>
<seg id="587">When repairs of roads, the applicant was handed over to the contract with a monthly delay at one event, and he accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">A substantial part of the provisions when opening the envelopes are identical in both countries with regard to the principle of “more eyes” and the principle of transparency, and thus allow substantially limit the risk of corruption and handling.</seg>
<seg id="590">German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for exact documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidential character of bids significantly restrict the possibility of subsequent changes in the submitted offers.</seg>
<seg id="592">Moreover, the workers are not responsible for opening the envelopes to carry out any other activities associated with the order to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The findings despite the detection of some irregularities confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of offers</seg>
<seg id="595">The contract must review and evaluate the offers received within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, it must grant the applicant who best meets the criteria for entering the order.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="598">The EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating offers in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to examine the suitability of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Applicants who were sometimes competent for bribery or defraudation must always be excluded from the procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="602">Offers of unpaid applicants must be assessed in terms of numerical correctness, technical suitability and value for money based on previously published procurement criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contract must determine the economically most favorable offer and especially check all significantly low quotations.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to handling.</seg>
<seg id="605">Applicants may, for example, exclude without legitimate reason or offer that do not meet the requirements, may be left in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The result of the evaluation can be incorrectly affected by the preferred of one applicant or its disadvantage, which may be prevented from the selection of the economically most advantageous offer.</seg>
<seg id="607">Therefore, the contract must accept special measures in the selection of persons incorporated into the process and must make sure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also be assured that the whole process and adopted decisions are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">Sadly with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require review and evaluation of offers in gradual steps.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for clause of applicants, evaluation criteria and their weight referred to in the notification or in the procurement documentation may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria set out for the evaluation of the suitability of the applicants cannot be further used.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation can only be done on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The submitted offers must first be examined from a formal point of view whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements that could choose to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id="616">If applicants from the next review and evaluation are excluded by them, they must be informed immediately about it.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the result of the evaluation of bids is disproportionately low offer prices, the applicant must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation in front of any elimination of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the applicant must maintain confidentiality and evaluation of offers can only be attended by justified persons.</seg>
<seg id="621">Mathematical accuracy of offers can only be reviewed by the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not incorporated into the decision-making phase of the supplier's selection or the phase of the project implementation can be authorized.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no exact provisions on who can perform further review and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are reviewing and evaluating the offers, they must realize that the offers are confidential, and honestly respect this fact.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only give proposals for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, the offers must be reviewed and evaluated by the Commission appointed by the applicant who will prepare a report with the draft conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contract.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the documents and statements required in connection with the submitting of offers are incomplete, the applicant must then submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If the applicants do not receive this obligation, their offers must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the client can decide whether the applicants can supplement the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">When the applicant is not committed, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany it is necessary to review not only the total price, but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the offer shows that prices for part of the total project were estimated disproportionately high or low, applicants must be asked to explain.</seg>
<seg id="635">If an explanation fails and if the contract can prove that the offer contains balancing prices, such offers must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">It should prevent applicants from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for individual parts of the total project, which can lead to a significant increase in the costs of the project.</seg>
<seg id="637">The total price of the work and the price of individual parts are not examined in detail in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="638">Compensation of awards is not a reason for excluding the offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract for the applicant will not be awarded, which will offer disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or several offers differ by 10% or more compared to the price of the estimated client or compared to other offers, applicants must prove that their offer has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are not able, the orderer should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure may be cancelled after the price review if only offers with disproportionately low prices and applicants have not justified these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the offer is significantly higher than the estimate of the client, it is not the reason for refusing to enter the applicant concerned (unlike the German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of meeting in Germany that has to limit the competition, the client is obliged to immediately report this fact to the relevant supervisor.</seg>
<seg id="645">He must decide on the further procedure and, if he informs the antimonopoly office or law enforcement authorities on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="646">Furthermore, it must be approved (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been granted to the applicant with the lowest offer), whether the contract will be granted when discussing the contract or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">The Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Verification of suitability and procurement criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most examined procurement proceedings were in accordance with relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some recommendations of potential suppliers made separately by self-employed persons, they did not uncontrol themselves by the orderer's suitability of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, the procurement procedure was not submitted sufficient documentation on whether the contract was taken into account by all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based only on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of stakeholders and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contractors used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of construction authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, carried out functions that were to be held solely by the client.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contractors tried to justify this fact by their insufficient human resources in the given sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review the offers of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and to perform with proper care of fulfilling their obligations arising from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">Regarding the contractors, usually there was no conclusive evidence of whether the offer in the custody of self-employed experts was only available to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and mathematical control of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contractors handed over open envelopes to further verification of self-employed experts without first carrying out the prescribed verification of offers and mathematical review and without documenting the results of these verification.</seg>
<seg id="663">In case of any intent of manipulation, third parties could make changes to offers that could not be identified by the client.</seg>
<seg id="664">The verification of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the offers were not adequately marked or when the data on prices and products were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">The sample control of one orderer revealed that in 75% of the cases of procurement procedure, the most suitable offers deviated by more than 10% from the pre- estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One of the twenty procurement proceedings was cancelled due to the unsatisfactory supply prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, the registration or sufficient documentation on the verification of offers or negotiations with the applicants for the purpose of further clarification lacked.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was also missing e.g. about unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">As a reason for deviations, changes in market prices or increased material costs were often stated.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contractors defended that identification and proving of balancing prices is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for bids made by the entity outside the circle of common contractors, 66% lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimation.</seg>
<seg id="673">Data on closer testing of costs or for determining the reasons for deviations were not recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">When clarifying this question, he did not find any indication of the price dumping in the applicant, to whom the contract would eventually be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the original cost estimation was overwhelmed, or whether the price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later he assessed this applicant as a “lower company” which was not able to meet even qualitative requirements, nor deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contract was awarded to the applicant whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimation.</seg>
<seg id="678">The client did not cancel the procurement procedure and stated the unjustified argument that the applicant could assume that the determination of his prices did not establish at disproportionately high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found for one client, and they were reported to a company that was responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two applicants submitted an offer containing an identical price calculation, which prompted the client to exclude both offers.</seg>
<seg id="682">The audits did not prove any substantial deficiencies in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction events, such as university buildings, roads and railways, the contractors did not exclude the applicants for public contract from participation in the procurement procedure, although they did not meet the requirements of the client specified in the procurement conditions, or did not allow the qualification to the desired extent, or on the contrary one orderer could not prove or explain the reason for the elimination of the applicant who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Rating</seg>
<seg id="687">The construction of the wastewater treatment plant was determined by the individual evaluation criteria of the procurement procedure for the contractor of the construction, but the contractor did not respect them during the management.</seg>
<seg id="688">The event in the area of railway infrastructure development was not established when the weight of the evaluation criteria is initiated when entering the order, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the project of repairs of roads, the evaluation of the "shortening of the construction period" was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">In the applicants on the second and third place, the greater shortening of the construction time was incorrectly stated during the evaluation than stated in their offers.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of reasons for selecting the applicant</seg>
<seg id="692">In three events associated with the support of housing, the contract did not allow the received offers and how he chose the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">The correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale orders associated with the construction of a road circuit with the expected price up to 500 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="694">CZK was not possible to verify, because suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of performance, however, documents about these meetings were not prepared.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, they comply with the rules for verification and evaluation of the offer of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, it differs with respect to the specific steps of proceedings and the selection of individuals in the proceedings included.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike the Czech Republic, these steps are governed in Germany by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially in terms of the application of the cross principle and the protection of offers.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the inability of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some cases, the checks found that the substantial steps of the process when verifying and evaluating the offers were not documented at all and if so, then only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">Absence of control tools and transparency in accepting decisions during review and evaluation of offers allows handling.</seg>
<seg id="702">The audits have shown serious defects, such as the transfer of offers to third parties without prior proper verification and documenting by the client.</seg>
<seg id="703">If the contractors entrust the third party with the performance of functions associated with the examination and evaluation of offers, the appropriate measures are necessary and increased control of measures against increased handling options.</seg>
<seg id="704">When checking the legitimacy of prices, the auditing German orderers did not use a complete set of available tools in all cases and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">deficiencies in the evaluation of the suitability of bids and the use of evaluation criteria were found in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After reviewing and evaluating the offers, the procurement process is completed by granting a contract or cancellation of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of European proceedings, all applicants must be informed in advance about the decision on the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers have the opportunity to review the adopted decisions within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and require its review if it is on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The deadline for 10 days applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract must not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the decision of the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and applicants must be given the opportunity to review the correctness of the procurement law by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contractor will be able to circumvent legal protection of suppliers of a quick implementation of the procurement procedure decision.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contract must be properly documented by the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries implemented about the information obligations of the management.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure on the contract is.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results properly done verification and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The client has to conclude a contract at the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reason is the fact that the applicant is not bound by his offer after the expiry of this period.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not be deviated from the winning offer.</seg>
<seg id="725">unsuccessful applicants should be informed about the result in time with the reason why their offer has not been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">Cancellation of the procurement procedure is permissible only when certain conditions are met, e.g. if prices in offers do not comply with specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of the contract 10 or 15 days applies to European and national proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provisions apply only to European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other proceedings in Germany, applicants cannot be informed about the award of the contract before deciding on its provisions of the EU and a review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure must be cancelled if the only offer is received or only the only offer met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must be granted, although the only offer has been received, provided that this offer meets the conditions set out in the procurement documentation and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The auditing operation was found only a few irregularities during the completion of controlled procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, European proceedings received the companies authorizing the letters before the announcement period, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In several cases, in several cases, the authorizing letters contained the modification incompatible with the content of the tender, e.g. the new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, the contractors did not meet the deadlines for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open management, the contract was selected by the second most advantageous offer, because the applicant offering a price of more than 50% of the lower one did not wish to meet the contract for the originally offered price.</seg>
<seg id="740">SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">During the reconstruction and construction of a university contracter in one case, the contractor did not close a contract for work in accordance with the draft contract contained in the offer of the selected applicant.</seg>
<seg id="742">In some events, the repairs and maintenance of roads, the construction of the motorway and the road circuit were concluded later than stipulated by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">For construction modifications in former military departments, the contractor sent a notification of the selection of the most suitable offer to all applicants to the expiry of the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries implemented EU regulations on termination of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to restricting corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the Institute of Legal Protection even in cases of orders under EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries it was found that the limited time limit for the conclusion of the contract was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause unfavourable economic consequences and increase the risk of handling.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, the contractors should eliminate such deficiencies during the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notification, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The process of procurement procedure with all its individual phases, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justification, must be documented in a transparent way.</seg>
<seg id="753">Completion of the procurement procedure at the European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">Data on procurement procedures are summarized in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in accordance with the basic requirement of the principle of transparency applied at the level of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-consuming documentation on decision-making and reasoning gives a guarantee of transparency in the process of procurement procedure, and above all guarantees effective legal protection of interests of each applicant in cases where the value of the order exceeds European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">The important documentation is also a substantial part of anti-corruption measures, because the obligation of detailed justification of individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces space for handling.</seg>
<seg id="759">In cases of European procurement proceedings, the contract must notify their completion of the Office for the publication of the EU (EU’s Office of Official Publications) within 48 days of the date of granting the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes notifications in the Official Journal of the EU and thus is fully the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contract must summarize the substantial data on its procurement procedures and disclose them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission issues annual statistics that allow you to get an overview of the development of the single market in the area of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of the German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have transposed the provisions of the European Documentation and Notification Obligations Act into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions concerning documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the assignment of the contract does not apply only to European proceedings, but also to national procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notification deadline is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation of reporting procurement proceedings, next to those compulsory on the basis of European law, applies only to limited proceedings exceeding the limit of 25 thousand € (625 thousand) and direct proceedings exceeding the limit of 15 thousand € (375 thousand) including VAT.</seg>

<seg id="801">The contractors should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement proceedings and to fully meet the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendation</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel controls of the SAO and BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the process of procurement of public procurement both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the application of EU procurement law and corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="804">The EU legislation gives the opportunity to international competition within the EU in order to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">The aim of the measures aimed at preventing corruption is not only to avoid it or to restrict it at least, but at the same time prevent financial damage and possible losses of trust in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The search control findings of both control institutions – the SAO and BRH – with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of the common and different elements that may be assisted by both countries in the further development and application of this right.</seg>
<seg id="807">Applications of the EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU law on public procurement, into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries, there is an important common base for public procurement and fulfilment of basic requirements in the area: competition; equal treatment of interested parties; transparency of procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="810">The contractors strengthen these requirements partly very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has undergone provisions on public procurement requiring European proceedings and management, which are under EU limits and therefore are governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, audits have shown that the contractors are not always fully in accordance with all relevant provisions of the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contractors should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures to eliminate the aforementioned irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the risks affecting the economy and achieving the value for money were identified.</seg>
<seg id="815">These are mainly incomplete definition of the subject of public procurement, which resulted in additional work, which were often entered in conflict with the law, insufficient definition of the expected price and the required qualification prerequisites narrowing the possible circle of applicants and thus reducing the competition especially in the field of transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint control did not aim to reveal cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that BRH and the SAO do not have sufficient tools.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they may examine whether the competent authorities of both countries accept measures to limit corruption and manipulate public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">Regarding the prevention of corruption, both countries focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">The German provisions mainly give space to a wide and unlimited competition, transparency and control as a central element of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="822">Czech regulations monitor mainly strengthening the transparency of procurement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles of corruption prevention that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles were also incorporated between the requirements for public procurement and were adopted to meet the specific needs of these entry.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes even very precisely, the ways to meet the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and the selection of persons incorporated in it.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the opinion of BRH, the principle of preference of open procurement proceedings and challenges to participation is particularly suitable by a substantial restriction of the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting the competition increases the risk of handling.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate control (especially the principle of cross control), requirements relating to transparency, documentation of procurement procedure and various organizational measures are also an effective mechanism for preventing corruption and handling.</seg>
<seg id="829">BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions, which must comply with public institutions during public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Inconsistencies found in some areas emphasized weaknesses in adhering to certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, the contractors should provide their employees with further education, and to record them with anti-corruption requirements and further increase their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the weakened weaknesses applies to activities that the building administration delegated to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls in delegating powers increases the risk of their abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to handling and corruption should therefore be transmitted to third parties only if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorized interventions.</seg>
<seg id="836">SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies were adopted at the government level, which significantly affect the areas of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO's auditing operation took place in the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, a significant amendment to the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">Accepted strategies and new legal regulations may be effective steps to improve the condition.</seg>
<seg id="840">According to the new regulations, for example, the contract must justify the effectiveness of the public procurement, the determination of the expected value of the public contract, adequacy of requirements for qualification prerequisites, determination of basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of bids and all properly document and publish.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendation</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion on ways of implementing EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their wide application in practice confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable base for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The multinational model introduced in the EU can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and supporting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damages arising as a consequence of manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, BRH and NKÚ insist that it is obliged to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and improve them where it is only possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">Especially organizational structures and procurement procedures processes should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for corrective steps and respond appropriately to it.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to practice in Germany, it resulted that the share of open procurement proceedings should increase in the Czech Republic, which give space to competition and significantly reduce the possibility of corruption behavior.</seg>
<seg id="848">The positive impact on the achieved price may also have orders for parts in cases where it is permissible and suitable for the client. Higher number of applicants creates pressure at a achieved price.</seg>
<seg id="849">The effect on the course of the procurement procedure is also ensured by its organization.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organizations, while in the Czech Republic, except for transport constructions, they organize central authorities themselves or through contractual organizations.</seg>
<seg id="851">The SAO and BRH want to further develop knowledge in their work where it is on the spot and address them with its parliament and government and beyond its joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">In addition, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will be subject to interest even at the level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the mentioned principles and findings have a general importance for effective combustion of corruption and guarantee that public procurement is entered in the regime of well-functioning and honest competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">COMPANY WARNING REPORT about the results of parallel control of consumer tax administration in Slovakia and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Common final report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>

<seg id="6">Úvodní slovo</seg>
<seg id="7">The submitted joint report informs about the course and result of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on managing excise duty in 2012–2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the highest audit institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a contract on cooperation between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO in the performance of parallel inspections focused on the management of excise duties concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel inspections was selected on the basis of the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at national level, as the consumer tax management system is set and what systems are different in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the auditing actions carried out consisted in the exchange of experience, identification of differences and finding good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, it was beneficial for finding that international comparability of data on performance and efficiency of consumer tax management is very limited without realization of parallel inspections.</seg>

<seg id="18">about the results of parallel control of SPD administration in Slovakia and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">Legal regulation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration is in accordance with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences were detected between the regulation of excise duty in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in the Czech Republic it contributes to effective management of excise duty verification of economic stability of applicants for issuing permits and compulsory marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils and some other oils; In Slovakia, the distribution of control signs is easier than in the Czech Republic and less burdening the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against the leaks on excise duty, as a good practice in both countries, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco, virtually tobacco raw materials, implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the registration of consumer packaging vendors of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="23">Income from consumer taxes in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is growing slower than other tax income.</seg>
<seg id="24">The objectives of the EU consisting in reducing labour taxation, in the introduction of environmentally economical measures and limiting tobacco and alcohol dependence have not yet been fulfilled in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, among others because the indexation of excise duty rates is not introduced in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This results in reducing the importance of excise duty on total tax revenues and due to the growing purchasing power of a real reduction in tax burden on excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="26">The introduction of environmental measures to the state financially supports, but these measures have a negative impact on income from excise duty, which will need to be replaced by other income or reducing the expenditure of the state in the future.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure spent on consumer tax management in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has long been growing, especially due to wage growth, and their effectiveness decreases.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Slovakia, the effectiveness of negatively influences the expenditure on the electronicisation of consumer tax administration (IT expenditure) and expenditure spent on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on the hatch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Electronization of consumer tax management in Slovakia has not significantly shown to reduce the number of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR recommend the SR to rethink the justification of the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on the hatch.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditure influenced the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply to the audited period of procedures that would lead to a reduction in personnel demands of consumer tax management.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, while the number of comparable tax entities is about a third lower in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in Slovakia carry out administrative acts mainly in the form of physical performance of tax supervision, while the tax administrators emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">The management of consumables in Slovakia is administrative more demanding than in the Czech Republic and due to the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities and more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Electronization of consumer tax management in Slovakia and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">The administration of tax returns to tax returns is fully electronized in Slovakia, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically transmitted in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both ways of electronicization support effective management of excise duties and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR are recommended to apply not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure on the introduction of the EMCS system could not be compared, because the SR has provided data on expenditure only for the system upgrade in the period 2011–2015, but the expenditure was spent even before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">The expenditure spent in the given period only for the EMCS upgrade was about 20% higher in Slovakia than expenditure spent in the Czech Republic both on the introduction of EMCS and to upgrade this system for more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">Consumer tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not reach comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in Slovakia the management of excise duty is significantly more demanding for resources.</seg>
<seg id="42">By introducing the electronic system for monitoring the motion of products subject to excise duty (EMCS), consumer tax management has been streamlined, but in Slovakia to a lower extent, because the introduction of the system and its modernization has been significantly higher expenditure than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation of both auditing institutions took place on the basis of the Treaty on Cooperation when implementing parallel inspections focused on the management of excise duty dated 18. 8. 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of Slovakia agreed to carry out parallel control, which will primarily focus on the issue of consumer tax management and whose results will allow an analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the facts found.</seg>
<seg id="46">joint audit issues were agreed from which parallel control was based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the course and destination of parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of parallel inspections was to compare the performance of consumer tax administrators taking into account quality and quantitative indicators and to identify weaknesses of the consumer tax administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">The following main audit questions should be answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">They achieved consumer tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditure?</seg>
<seg id="51">There has been an introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the motion of products subject to consumer tax (Excise Movement and Control System – EMCS) to streamline consumer tax management and have been expenditure on its introduction effectively?</seg>
<seg id="52">In parallel checks, the causes of significant differences affecting efficiency and efficiency of tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the field of legislation and in the setting of the organizational structure, should be found.</seg>
<seg id="53">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The Directorate-General of the Customs (GŘC) and the Slovak Republic (G SR) joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries, among the objectives of this declaration include the areas of excise duty, among other things, the fight against fraud, exploring the possibility of harmonizing legislation and finding harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, exploring the possibility of joint activities to increase efficiency in revealing fraud and sharing experience and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 EMCS is operated according to the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 1152/2003/EC, dated 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty.</seg>

<seg id="67">Controlled person: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation for consumer tax in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">Legislation of consumer tax administration is divided into EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/EC, a general regulation of excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, defines consumer tax and determines the basic rules for tax administration and handling of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive allows to impose taxes on consumption and other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">EU legislation regulates the minimum conditions for: the amount of tax rates for individual types of selected products, production, storage, processing and possession of products subject to tax, tax obligation, tax exemption and tax refund, supervision of transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and management of registers on economic entities and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">The EU's legal regulation allows you to implement control procedures and institutes at national level provided they will not disrupt competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Legislation of excise duty in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, the legal regulation of excise duty is concentrated into the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) which regulates the administration of mineral oil tax, alcohol tax, tobacco tax tax, beer tax, wine and intermediate tax and raw tobacco tax.</seg>
<seg id="77">This Act defines the forms of handling products subject to consumer tax, taxpayer, authorisation proceedings, conditions for the transport of products, tax returns and penalties for breach of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">The law and follow-up decrees further regulate some other conditions for handling mineral oils (marking of mineral oils), limiting the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for another purpose than for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes from other energy products (i.e. Natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels and electricity are adjusted in parts of 45 to 47 of Act No. 261/2007 Coll., on stabilization of public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, there are also a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duty, contained in special legislation. The Act on Fuel No. 311/2006 Coll. and implementing regulation regulates the conditions for sale, dispensing, distribution of fuels and management of fuel registration referred to in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">61/1997 Coll., on the Liquid, and in its implementing regulations the conditions for production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol are defined.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No. 307/2013 Coll., on compulsory marking of alcohol, and the relevant implementing regulations stipulates mandatory marking of liabilities in consumer packaging, conditions for handling control tapes and conditions for alcohol management (i.e. for production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, takeover, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">The procedures for tax proceedings, which are not listed in special regulations, regulates Act No. 280/2009 Coll., Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">The penalties are stored by procedures under Act No.500/2004 Coll., Administrative Code.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for the issuance of trade licence (concese) to operate the trade “production and processing of fuels and lubricants and fuel distribution” and “production, treatment and sale of fermentation, alcohol consumption and spirits” are regulated by Act No. 455/1991 Coll., on Trade Entrepreneurship (the Trade Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic used the authorization to introduce control procedures and institutes for checking the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and for supervision of compliance with the legislation in the handling of selected products where excise tax was not taken, even when handling selected products where the tax was already taken.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is a monitoring of handling with special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking some other mineral oils, tobacco marking and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic has used the authorization to apply consumer tax to other products and has introduced consumer tax from raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duty in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">Based on the Government Resolution of the Czech Republic dated 3 October 2012 No. 735, the “plan tolerance plan for the black spirits market” was implemented in 2012–2015 in the Czech Republic, a major legislative regulation introduced by a number of measures against tax fraud on alcohol tax.</seg>
<seg id="91">In the same period, there has also been substantial changes in the legal regulation for mineral oil tax, tobacco tax taxes and the punishment of the preparation of tax.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal protection of tax income</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective from 1. 7. 2016 is introduced a penalty for the preparation of a crime “shortening tax, fee and similar compulsory payments”. The regulation should allow the police authorities to be more effective and timely acceptance of measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. deployment of operatively search funds.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions of consumer tax administration</seg>
<seg id="95">Issue of permits to handle products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is effective from 1. 1. 2015 conditional: reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; authorization to operate trade enabling the performance of activities related to authorisation; situations where the author is not in liquidation or in decline.</seg>
<seg id="96">The aim of the legal regulation was to solve the issue of tax fees, by reducing entities with authorization to handle products subject to consumer tax taxation.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability newly allows tax administrator to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both within the framework of the licensing procedure and after the issuance of the permit.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities from sufficient financial income to proper fulfilment of tax obligations to handle selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">The assessment of economic stability was determined by indicators (rentability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity), based on which financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, it also depends on the administrative discretion of the tax administrator with regard to the individual conditions of the management.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law is determined by periodicity of testing the fulfilment of the conditions of economic stability due to the actuality of the data – the examination takes place once a year following the deadline for filing a income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax administrator has the opportunity to determine other conditions necessary for tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the holder of the permit does not fulfil the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the authorisation or cancel the delay with the delay.</seg>
<seg id="104">From a total of 2,609 entities where the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, it was 18.6% of the found economically unstable with a high risk of non-payment in the event that the tax obligation exceeds the amount of taxation (e.g. repeated recipient).</seg>
<seg id="105">The authorisation was cancelled by ten entities, the other applicants increased the provision of tax, capitalized their deposit into the company or documented the current data from accounting, according to which they already met all the conditions for issuing the permit.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the propeller, the terms and conditions of reliability and indebtedness must also meet the natural person who is a statutory body or is a member, or a natural person who is not a statutory body of the propeller or his member, but performs this activity (throwing legal entities in the position of a statutory body or its member, so-called linked entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 established entities were tested.</seg>
<seg id="108">The registration conducted under the Excise Tax Act (§ 37 to § 40 and § 60 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) contains data:</seg>
<seg id="109">The type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, taken over, issued or sent, in a breakdown according to the type of tax regime of loading (implemented exemption mode from tax, import, re-according to the regime of conditional exemption from tax, exports, free tax circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">identifier (SEED ID) recipient or supplier of selected products, declarant, date of creation of the event and registration in the registration;</seg>
<seg id="111">transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, transport number);</seg>

<seg id="114">The receipt of the takeover after transport must be made immediately after its termination.</seg>
<seg id="115">In case of registration maintained electronically, the records must be kept or enabled output in xls format, xlsx, suction.</seg>
<seg id="116">Lahah</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures whose purpose was to ensure a detailed overview of the activities of entities (see Annex 3, scheme A) from the production of crude alcohol through the marking of the control tape to the distribution of the final vendor or the authorized user of the alcohol exempt from the tax.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, it is subject to supervision of customs authorities and production facilities for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of alcohol processing and the production of spirits and to identify the person dealing with alcohol in consumer packaging, reduce alcohol management on a financially stable and reliable person and ensure constant supervision of the production and marking of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are: Registration for production, income, inventory and alcohol issue contains information about the amount of liabilities according to individual stages of the production and processing of alcohol with the indication of documents.</seg>

<seg id="129">Registration designation of the control tape is introduced for marking spirits with a volume greater than 0.06 liters.</seg>
<seg id="130">When transporting control belts, the registration designation must be specified in documents on transport or customs declarations in export.</seg>
<seg id="131">Control tape until 30. 11. 2013 contained a ten-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration subscription number, the code of the application allocation of control tapes and the code of classification according to the level of volume concentration of ethanol.</seg>
<seg id="132">Control tape from 1. 12. 2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in consumer packaging expressed in milliliters etanol at 20 °C, and this rounding to the whole milliliters downwards.</seg>

<seg id="137">Restrictions of control tapes only on registered holders who must not assign them to another person except for their provision of a foreign supplier for the purpose of designing spirits in consumer packaging manufactured outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">The control tapes exported must be placed on the consumer packaging and back imported by nine months after receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of the alcohol distributor in the consumer package provided the fulfilment of similar personal conditions as a mandatory mark of the hatch and the obligation to fold the deposit up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. 185 000 €).</seg>

<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic introduced a comprehensive supervisory system (see Annex 3, scheme B), which is subject to mineral oils burdened with consumer taxes, but also selected mineral oils of consumer tax unloaded, which were abused to tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from mineral oil production through storage, transport, marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils, marking some other mineral oils to the delivery of the final consumer or the user and in some cases the consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">The monitoring of customs authorities also includes the production of marking substances for marking mineral oils and handling these substances.</seg>
<seg id="158">Marking and dyeing selected mineral oils are subject to mineral oils listed under the codes combined nomenclature 2710 19 25 (petroleum others), 2710 19 29 (other elsewhere not specified middle oil) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49, if not marking is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">Marking some other mineral oils are subject to benzole, toluen, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils designed for other purposes than the engine drive.</seg>

<seg id="163">The most important new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring with special mineral oils, which is a group of mineral oils under the codes combined nomenclature 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils designed for other purposes than the engine drive), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is lower than 12 mm2. s-1 including and have at least one of these properties: the flare point is lower than 150 °C, at the distillation test it is preceded by at least 20% of the volume, including losses up to 350 °C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils were abused as a mixture to finished fuels, especially a motor diesel, or were directly used or sold for engine drive, because physical properties are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Registered with the tax administrator must be treated with mineral oils of freely loose or in the package exceeding 220 liters.</seg>
<seg id="167">For the issuance of registration, personal conditions of the applicant must be fulfilled, the statutory body and responsible representative, which applies throughout 2 Except beer, fruit wines, other wines and honey and fruit distillates obtained by burning.</seg>

<seg id="170">registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">K 30. 11. 2016 the register of persons dealing with special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, four registration was cancelled on the holder of the registration holder.</seg>
<seg id="172">Electronic records must contain detailed information on income, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil involving the numbers of documents, notifications of acquisition of the tax administrator, place of storage and consumption, the purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or when selling instead of delivery and registration number of the customer.</seg>

<seg id="176">Announcement of the purpose of use and marking, place of storage or consumption, identification data of the person who is a special mineral oil further sold or transferred, are transmitted before each change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Announcement is submitted electronically via intelligent forms or data box in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, the person dealing with special mineral oils filed 630 announcements.</seg>
<seg id="179">Ensuring and forfeiture of special mineral oils, or means of transport, the tax administrator must express in cases where the handling of special mineral oils without registration or when the registered person does not meet his notification obligation.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of failure to meet the obligations in the transport of products subject to consumer tax, these shortcomings cannot be corrected additionally.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are entitled to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">The registered distributors of fuel can only be persons meeting the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="183">Required ends of the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The application for a license, or to the provisions of the responsible representative, gives the opinion of the customs office, which examines whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or members of the statutory body of the applicant – legal entities and the established representative meet the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">If these persons meet the condition of reliability, the customs office issues a agreed opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reliable person means a person integrity in terms of criminal property nature, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">The condition of issuing the concession is professional competence.</seg>
<seg id="188">Non-service of the same circle of persons as in case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">The non-service person is a person who provides sufficient warranties that will be properly and timely fulfilled by his payment obligations against the state, i.e. has no fees for the state budget and general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">Distributor of fuel must not be a court or administrative body expressed by the ban on activities preventing the performance of its activities.</seg>
<seg id="191">Fuel distributor must not be in liquidation or in bankruptcy.</seg>

<seg id="197">To claim the return of the excise duty on mineral oils can only be in the activity that is clearly related to the activities carried out on land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, it was about 64 thousand applied claims for tax refund in the total amount of CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e. 43 401 720 €).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced the return of excise duty on fuels to farmers with animal production.</seg>
<seg id="200">They will newly be able to apply this claim of farmers or breeders who, for example, deal with cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restricting the sale of tobacco products with an old tax rate</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term not reaching budgeted income from the excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic has introduced itself effective from 1. 12. 2014 restrictions on tobacco sales with an old tax rate in case of a change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Consumer tobacco tax is paid by using tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">Using tobacco stickers means its location on the unit package (§ 116 of the Excise Tax Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the use of the excise duty rate, the production of tobacco product is decisive in a state intended for the final consumer, while unloading, delivery, sending or sale, or the sale of the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter alphabet characterizing the excise duty rate is stated on tobacco stickers along with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, the sticker states the number of pieces in the package or the amount of tobacco for smoking in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">Tobacco sticker has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packaging of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and the tobacco sticker with the previous (may) tax rate was determined until the last day of the second calendar month after the efficiency of the new excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">From the development of tobacco stickers in 2014 and compared to the development in previous years, it implies that tobacco manufacturers have significantly pre-submitted tobacco products with the “story” tax rate, which has been a factual shift in the effectiveness of the “new” tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Tax from raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the misuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without authorisation of the tax administrator and the donation of excise duty, a raw tobacco tax was introduced as measures against tax fraud and monitoring raw tobacco management.</seg>
<seg id="213">Effective from 1. 7. 2015 is subject to a consumer donation of raw tobacco, which was not used or delivered for the production of tobacco products, delivered to another Member State or a third country or for which the origin has not been proven, the purpose of use or the person who has been or should be delivered to the raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="214">Limitation to handle raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as supervision of transport and production of tobacco products, marking of unit packaging of control tape and restriction of sales in defined places, was supplemented with restrictions on the raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">The production equipment for the processing of tobacco raw materials and the production of tobacco surveillance of customs authorities is not subject.</seg>
<seg id="217">Storage raw tobacco for another purpose than for the production of tobacco products can only be a registered person, but such a tobacco must not be further processed or modified.</seg>

<seg id="222">Data on the business partner, the amount of raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of the use and data on the carrier, are notified.</seg>
<seg id="223">Announcement of the expected amount in the relevant year of the received or sent raw tobacco presents the entity together with the application for registration or by the end of January the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Announcement is submitted electronically by a data box in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="225">Transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by proof with prescribed requirements.</seg>
<seg id="226">Legislation of excise duties in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating the area of excise duty in Slovakia is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its uniform tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Individual types of excise duty are taxatively determined by the legislation of the Slovak Republic, which is similar to legislation of the surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="230">Legislative regulation of excise duty ensures four laws according to individual tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="231">98/2004 Z. z., on the consumer tax of mineral oils, Act No. 106/2004 Z. z., on the consumer tax of tobacco products, Act No. 530/2011 Z. z., on consumer tax on alcoholic beverages, Act No. 609/2007 Z. z., on consumer electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All consumer tax laws represent the regulations of material law and deal with taxation of the subject of excise duty on the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">563/2009 Z. z., about administration of taxes (tax rules), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates tax administration, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework was transposed by the individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008, on general regulation of excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European Community were transposed.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duty in relation to the subject of control in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, the legislation on consumer tax administration has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual consumer taxes.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS system, monitoring the transport of selected products subject to consumer tax in conditional exemption from the tax was changed from a deciduous parade administrative document to exclusively an electronic system where these transport is monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Within the framework of the EMCS electronic system, the suspension of access to tax entities to EMCS was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the opportunity to suspend access to justified fears of the invalid or undefined tax from previous tax periods and its inexplicability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This concerns the maturity of the tax, because when transporting goods subject to excise duty, the composition of the reinsurance is required, which is released by the completion of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Consumer mineral oil tax</seg>
<seg id="243">A fundamental change in the administration of the excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using the so-called red naphtha was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">Marked gas oil, commonly called red naphtha, was one of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for a specific law defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the income part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of the abolition of the red naphtha was to reduce the deficit of public finances, to simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and to reduce the administrative burden affected by business entities.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel vendor.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal change was the introduction of the obligation of keeping records for all petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The insighting of the movement of the taxed petrol and diesel is related to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely a distributor of fuel and fuel.</seg>
<seg id="252">The aforementioned change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion in petrol and diesel and clarified the movement of these fuel (see Annex 4, scheme A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, legal provisions on the records of tax entities trading with lubrication and base oils were extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">In Slovakia, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation of indicating the indication substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Consumer tax on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the Act on Tobacco raw material was extended and a new tax entity was introduced – a tobacco trader.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, the obligation to record technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">Legislation brought a new ordering system, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control stamps intended for labelling consumer packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The control mark is called cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">As part of the new system, the customer must ask the customs office for the issue of inspection stamps electronically, through the information system to the collection of checks.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step was introduced by electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state printer was established for check signs – in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The performance of the tax supervision above the printing of the inspection stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">Changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system of printing of control stamps strengthens the system of goods control, because unique identification number is generated to the control mark, which can be easily verified whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">Unique twelve-digit identification number (1.–2. The place consists of the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to the control mark or group of packages; 4th place is identifier of the series; 5.–8. The place is alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. The place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The inspection mark designed for labelling cigarettes must be listed on the price of cigarettes, a sign for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarette pieces in the consumer packaging and the length of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Consumer tax on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The largest legislative change touched the lila, wine and beer, because the original three regulations of material law were abolished and one joint law on the excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was elaborated mainly because of the need for a summary solution to the issue of taxation of alcoholic beverages, solving their production, monitoring of movement, taxing, as well as needs to improve the business environment in the given area, streamline the performance of tax administration, reduce administrative burden for small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="272">The new method of solving the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages was introduced by the use of a uniform excise duty rate on alcoholic drink and took into account the volume percentage of real alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">In the most anticipated wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of real alcohol content in the final product is taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed in volume percent of the actual alcohol content in the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">The category of small-scale fermented beverages was introduced, whose essence lies in the liberation from the excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented drink for its own consumption and for the consumption of its household at most in the amount of 1,000 litres for the economic year.</seg>
<seg id="276">Legislation brought a new ordering system, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control stamps intended for labelling consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">As part of the new system, the customer must ask the customs office for the issue of inspection stamps electronically, through the information system to the collection of checks.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step was introduced by electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state printer was established for check signs – in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The performance of the tax supervision above the printing of the inspection stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">Changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, scheme B) and elimination of falsification of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system of printing of control stamps strengthens the system of goods control, because unique identification number is generated to the control mark, which can be easily verified whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">Unique twelve-digit identification number (1.–2. The place consists of the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to the control mark or group of packages; 4th place is identifier of the series; 5.–8. The place is alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. The place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Compare</seg>
<seg id="286">Consumer taxes from alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediates are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common Act No.3353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Real fuels tax, natural gas tax and some other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">By contrast, each excise duty is regulated in Slovakia by a special law, except for the Consumer Beverages Act, which contains alcohol tax, beer, wine and intermediates.</seg>
<seg id="289">The special law regulates the excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">It is from 1. 1. 2015 issuing a permit to handle products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act conditioned, among other things, by demonstrating economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by implementing financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In Slovakia, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding or reducing taxes.</seg>
<seg id="292">The SR of the SR performs a tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the financial headquarters above the management with control stamps to mark alcohol and tobacco products, their liquidation in the printer and their sale by individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is provided by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">There is no supervision of customs authorities over the production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control tapes will take over the authorized territorial workplace of the customs office in Kutná Hora from the printer.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers take over their customers at this territorial workplace, control tapes for marking liabilities are further distributed by individual local tax administrators according to the place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">Legislation of the Czech Republic manufacturer of tobacco stickers and control tapes do not define.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Slovakia there is a obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its parts, such obligation is not introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic tobacco sticker bears the excise duty of tobacco products, which is paid during the collection of tobacco stickers at the authorized customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">On the other hand, in Slovakia the excise duty on tobacco products does not contain in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a return of excise duty from mineral oils was introduced in the audited period in the case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green naphtha.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this return was extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In Slovakia such support of farmers is not introduced (existing until 31. 12. 2010 as so-called red naphtha).</seg>
<seg id="304">To strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of CZK 20 million was introduced in the Czech Republic for fuel distributors (i.e. 740 thousand €).</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors from 1 891 entities was reduced to 174 in 2014 (i.e. decline by 1 717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">A similar institute of fuel distributor is introduced in Slovakia, but without the composition of the deposit necessary for the provision of excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">303 distributors were registered in Slovakia and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In Slovakia, the Institute of Disease Vendor and Fuel Consumer, which issued permission of the local customs office, is established.</seg>
<seg id="309">In the Czech Republic, such an institute is not introduced.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, the marking of selected mineral oil is subject and some other mineral oils, in Slovakia after the abolition of so-called red naphtha, mineral oil labelling does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the control tape for marking the alcohol contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and twelve-digit registration code with the distillation of the spirits according to which the control tape records are maintained.</seg>
<seg id="312">Destruction, loss and return of the control tape is written into the register by the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape is obliged to notify their use at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="314">In Slovakia, the control mark intended for marking alcohol in the consumer package contains a unique twelve-digit identification number, which is communicated to the tax administrator once a month and serves to verify the authenticity of the check mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The registration contains the number of removed, used and advertised control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced the institute of compulsory registration, or the registration of the alcohol distributor.</seg>
<seg id="317">In Slovakia, the registration is conditional on the fulfilment of the conditions binding among other things on the storage area exceeding 200 m2; the annual turnover from the sale of the consumer packaging of the alcohol by at least CZK 100,000 or the repaid basic property of at least CZK 100,000; the minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining the registration is conditioned by the deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. 185 000 €) for the benefit of the tax administrator for the entire period of registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">A permanent presence of the tax administrator requires a permanent presence of the tax administrator in Slovakia in the production of alcohol not only in the consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, a special form of registration of a person compulsory to mark a hatch with the condition of a deposit for the benefit of the tax administrator from CZK 100,000 (i.e.) is required in the production of alcohol in the consumer packaging. 3 700 €) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. 185 000 €) according to the amount of checks taken and the installation of the tracking device with continuous access to the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legal regulation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia exceeds the minimum requirements of the EU on the subject and management of consumer taxes and responds to identified risks from other Member States and the risks identified on tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted in the audited period allow tax administrators to prevent the formation of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia within the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. sheets) excise tax on raw tobacco, or tobacco raw material was introduced above the EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco or tobacco raw material is not harmonised tobacco product, the Czech Republic and Slovakia monitor their movement.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO may recommend that the measures are applied to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that verification of economic stability in applicants for issuing permits under the Excise Tax Act has proven to be successful because it reduces the risks of tax fees.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both control institutions recommend applying such testing also in the Slovak conditions.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs authorities related to transport between the printer and the customer of the control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The SR's financial administration has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for tobacco production.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in the Czech Republic, however, a more efficient tax collection of tobacco products is, because the order of tobacco stickers is a tax return with a subsequent payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">Thanks to the introduction of the Institute of fuel, the financial administration in Slovakia has a better overview of the locations of fuel sales.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of compulsory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic enables easier control of mineral oil abuse with a reduced tax rate or exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014) a new control tape was introduced, or a stamp containing identification code.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in Slovakia a new legislation has abandoned its placing.</seg>
<seg id="337">The impacts of the so far cannot be assessed due to short efficiency of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of the consumer packaging of the alcohol mark, or the tape is effective measures in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic can also recommend the introduction of this inspection measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by the client approach, which does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">On the other hand, the approach of the Czech Republic is rather restrictive, because it introduces a deposit burdening cash flow of tax entities, but more reduces the risk of developing tax fees.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of income from excise duty</seg>
<seg id="343">Consumer tax is an indirect tax introducing the state to increase the revenue of the state budget and also regulate the amount of goods sold, whose consumption is considered harmful to individuals and/or the company (regulation function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to Commission Communication: EVROPA 2020 – Strategy for Smart and Sustainable Growth Supporting Inclusion from 3. 3. 2010 within the flagship initiative Europe less demanding for resources is the intention of the European Commission to improve the framework for the use of tools based on market, among others in the form of revision of energy taxation focusing on reducing energy and resources consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">To fulfil the intention of the EC, Member States should try to move tax burden from labour force among other things to energy and ecological taxation within the greater “ecological” of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">Inkaso tax revenues from excise duty in the Czech Republic and Slovakia include the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediates, natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of consumer taxes on total tax revenues and the share of GDP is monitored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both supreme control institutions used the following selection criteria for entering the query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Inkaso excise duty in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duty on total tax revenues and the share of GDP declined slightly according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">For conversion of amounts in CZK to € to 31. The European Central Bank of the ECB was used on the 12th relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 weakened 9.1% year on year (from 25140 to 27.425).</seg>
<seg id="353">The reason was mainly the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision dated 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of consumer tax collection, consumer tax rates and income per capita in € significantly decreased due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">A significant reduction in the share of excise duty in 2014 was caused by a one-off outage of income from excise duty on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with an old tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of consumer taxes is also affected by the growth of income tax collection, which has grown significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">On the total collection of excise duties, the largest share of mineral oil tax (in 2015 about 55.7%), but despite the significant growth in the economy against 2012, it dropped.</seg>
<seg id="358">Inkaso excise duty made of mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as measures against tax fraud in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of environmentally economical vehicles and the support of biofuels is reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A significant share has natural gas tax, solid fuels tax and electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to minimum rates set out in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="361">If rates are not increased, their share will decrease in the future with regard to the ever-increasing energy intensity of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">Inkaso excise duty from alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the reverberation of an extensive case of tax fraud consisting in the introduction of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, after accepting a number of measures against such negotiations and after the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on the alcohol exceeded CZK 4 million by 4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result of increasing rates, the share of tobacco tax tax.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duty were changed between 2012–2015 for tobacco tax, where the rate was increased mainly due to the compliance of Council Directive 2011/64/EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">Due to the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duty in €, in addition to tobacco tax, has fallen significantly. At tobacco products, only slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or standard of living, indexation of consumer tax rate does not have to be fulfilled, the function of consumer taxes consisting in regulation of socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With economic growth of the Czech Republic and the growth in standard of living, real consumer tax rates are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexing – automatic regulation of a certain economic variable on inflation, this regulation occurs under the law or contract (for pensions paid by the state is called valorization).</seg>
<seg id="370">Inkaso excise duty in relation to macroeconomic indicators in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="371">In the current legislative regulation of excise duty in Slovakia, the indexing of consumption tax rates on consumer prices is not addressed, because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="375">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all excise duties introduced in Slovakia, the largest share of year-round tax revenues of the state budget is the excise duty on mineral oils, while its share fell under 52% throughout the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">The second largest share shows excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">This tax consists in an average of approximately 32% share of the total selection of consumer taxes.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, the excise duty collection on one country was growth.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is caused by the growth of consumer tax rates from tobacco products, higher capability and higher consumption of the population in the given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth in consumer tax collection per capita of the SR is constant and corresponds to the development of consumption tax rates from tobacco products, higher capability and higher consumption of the population in the given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is affected by the CNB's interventions in the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the total collection from SPD is caused mainly by the collection of excise duty from mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2.7 times in the Czech Republic, or 2.8 times higher, but per capita of the Czech Republic is already higher by about 1/3.</seg>
<seg id="384">The cause is the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic as a result of lower consumer tax rates in the Czech Republic and CZK against € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">For mineral oil taxes, it is also due to greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of tobacco tax, the growing foreign tourism in the Czech Republic has a significant effect and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation of the Real Consumption rates in the Czech Republic as a result of the CNB's intervention declined.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues does not enter and there is no deviation from the taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to consumer tax, which is not in accordance with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the achieved values of consumer tax share are permanently compared to the OECD average above average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The total collection of excise duty is influenced mainly by changing the rates of excise duty, development of economic condition and behavior of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">The future outages of excise tax on the ecological measures that the state subsidizes by various forms will need to be replaced by other income or decreasing the expenditure of the state.</seg>
<seg id="392">By not introducing an indexation of consumption tax rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their regulatory functions decreased and the EU targets are insufficiently supported in Europe, less dependent on environmentally friendly sources and in limiting alcohol and tobacco dependence.</seg>
<seg id="393">In a higher collection of excise duty on per capita in the Czech Republic, higher consumption of selected products of foreign consumers is manifested, which is affected by a lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure taxes</seg>
<seg id="395">The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the mutual relationship between expenditure and income related to consumer tax administration, i.e. expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 income units (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of the administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of the tax administrator on tax administration affects the competence and organisational arrangement of the tax administrator, organization management, legal environment and the level of electronicization of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">Determination of the effectiveness of administrative costs of tax administration by the conversion coefficient method is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in the line-controlled structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, in addition to other activities, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organizational component of the state and accounting unit, performs in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, with the authorities of the customs administration are internal organizational unit, costs and revenues are included aggregate for the entire organizational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the effectiveness of consumer tax management into the calculation of the effectiveness of administrative costs, expenditure and income Financial administration of the Czech Republic were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of consumer tax management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The management of consumables is the complex of administrative tasks, which performs especially the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial control acts perform other public administration bodies, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">The administration of excise duty is carried out in particular by the following departments:</seg>

<seg id="434">Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic from 1. 1. 2012 underwent a demanding process of transformation in accordance with the approved UNITAS program.</seg>
<seg id="435">The establishment of the Germany was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly created unit of merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In connection with the performance of consumer tax administration, activities related to consumer tax administration were incorporated into a larger number of different sections and related trade unions in the organizational structure of the SR.</seg>

<seg id="444">department of remedies for excise duty – reviewing the decision of customs authorities on the basis of applied proper and extraordinary remedies; appeal proceedings on the second degree of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="445">The section of customs authorities was established during 2012; individual customs authorities (9 customs authorities) were directly incorporated under it, which have a territorial competence intended for higher territorial units, except for one customs office, which was established among others in order to fulfil tasks in connection with the external border of the Community.</seg>

<seg id="451">Financial administration expenditure of Slovakia on consumer tax management is constantly growing, as with the exception of wage growth, investments in effective taxes and electronicisation of financial administration are increased.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although income from consumer taxes grew, expenditure due to IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project grew faster.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure is significantly affected in Slovakia by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on the hatch, which does not apply the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">The expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2015, this growth was caused mainly by growth in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, income from excise duty grew approximately at the same pace.</seg>
<seg id="456">The payroll expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively affected by wider competencies of customs administration, e.g. weighing trucks, checking the fulfilment of obligations in connection with myth.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in Slovakia has a slightly deteriorating tendency year on year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees has not changed significantly, but expenditure on one employee grew.</seg>
<seg id="459">Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees has not changed significantly, but the expenditure on one employee compared to Slovakia grew slower.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is an important factor in the deteriorated efficiency of administrative expenditure of wage growth, which can be assessed as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, a significant administrative complexity seems to be a negative factor in managing consumer taxes, which confirms the non-reducing number of employees in the field of consumer tax management.</seg>
<seg id="463">In Slovakia, however, the management of excise duty on lower income is significantly more demanding at personnel capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of consumer tax management</seg>
<seg id="465">The management of consumables is a set of activities aimed at finding out, determining and securing tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the management of excise duties are taxation, occupation and registration for activities, supervision of transport, control and searching for tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The number of administrative acts and administered entities are the indicators of the tax administrator's performance.</seg>
<seg id="468">The mutual relationship between the monitored indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the effectiveness of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of specific activities.</seg>
<seg id="469">Permission and registration for activities are the basic prerequisite for handling selected products for business purposes and their transport in conditional liberation mode from tax.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to carry out continuous administration with a focus on monitoring the fulfilment of legislation and conditions set out in the tax administrator, which must be allocated adequate personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="471">The monitored indicator was the number of valid permits or registrations for activities as of 31 December of individual years.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of issued permission or registration is not identical to the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the matter.</seg>

<seg id="523">The order of the control tapes to mark the alcohol can only be submitted to the tax administrator locally by the competent marking person compulsory to mark the hatch and is carried out through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the markers of alcohol markers.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered amount of control tapes and ordering the production.</seg>
<seg id="525">He does not look at the production of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">The production is provided by the State Printer of valuables, state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">The checking tapes collector takes control tapes at the tax administrator locally competent marking.</seg>
<seg id="528">Ordering tobacco stickers for marking cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and tobacco to smoking fulfills the function of a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of tobacco sticker corresponds to the amount of tax obligation, while the customer's tobacco sticker is obliged to pay their value within 60 days of their removal from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate the value corresponding to the amount of tax obligation ordered by tobacco stickers in the order.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period applies only if the value of tobacco stickers is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order of tobacco stickers is submitted to the printed matter specified by the Ministry of Finance in writing or through the data box with the possibility of using intelligent forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco stickers is provided by the State Printer of valuables, state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorized tax administrator, who is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (the territorial workplace Kutná Hora), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator who further distributes them and further checks their transport, storage and use for customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include proper tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders of tobacco stickers, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">Included in the tax return on customs proceedings based on customs declarations and the employment of claims for tax refunds from: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used within the business activities other than for the production of heat or engines of engines, mineral oils used for agricultural primary production.</seg>
<seg id="537">The imposed fines include administrative proceedings on the hearing of the found breach of legislation, and this is a set of follow-up administrative acts. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) in the sense of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form: application for administrative cooperation, answers to the application for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, reports on the event, reports on control.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport taking place in the regime of conditional exemption from tax between the Czech Republic and EU Member States – the Czech customs office is the tax administrator of the receiver or sending tax warehouse or authorized recipient.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="540">Permission and registration for activities in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="541">The management of excise duties in Slovakia is ensured mainly by customs authorities and the Department of Excise Taxes of the Customs and Tax Section of the SR, whose procedure for managing excise duty regulates individual consumer tax laws and tax rules.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws are determined not only by the scope of authorization for the CÚ and the SR in the administration of excise duties, but also to the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was due to an increase in issued permits under tax warehouses, an increase in registrations of a legitimate recipient for repeated acceptance and by registering a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">Legislation has refined the transport of some loose mineral oils, as well as reporting obligation if they are transported freely or in packaging with greater than 150 liters or 230 liters, and also expanded the list of mineral oils that are subject to control and procedure during transport, other goods, e.g. to knock the motors, oxidation inhibitors, nutritious inhibitors, preparations for improvement of viscosity, corrosion preparations.</seg>
<seg id="545">Compulsory data relating to the introduction of their kinematic viscosity was introduced for lubricating oils.</seg>
<seg id="546">The approach of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in Slovakia is stated in the following parts of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Operator of the tax warehouse</seg>
<seg id="548">Within the framework of the national legislation of Slovakia during the registration of the tax warehouse operator within all items of the consumer tax, the person who wants to operate a tax warehouse must also apply to registration and issuance of permission to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is a certificate of registration for the relevant consumer tax, which the tax warehouse operator receives legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CÚ will issue a permit to operate a tax warehouse that entitles the tax warehouse operator to produce, process, store, receive or send selected products in the condition of conditional exemption from tax.</seg>
<seg id="551">If the tax warehouse operator has a tax warehouse in multiple locations, the tax administrator will issue a separate permit to operate a tax warehouse on each tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">Transport of the subject of excise duty in conditional liberation mode from tax is monitored electronically through the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated on each transport, called</seg>
<seg id="554">ARC code under which it is possible to watch the above transport online, and therefore in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the tax warehouse operator is also a person authorized to distribute the alcohol, it is obliged to notify the CÚ trade name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and barcode EAN for each new type of consumer packaging, which states in the free tax circulation, at the latest on the day of its launch.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">The registered sender is a special type of tax entity who cannot be registered simultaneously as a tax warehouse operator, although he sends the item of excise duty in the condition of conditional exemption from tax after his release into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Within the framework of the national legislation of Slovakia during the registration of the registered sender within all items of the consumer tax, the person who wants to send the subject of excise duty in the condition of conditional exemption from tax after its release into the customs regime “free circulation” must also apply the CÚ also to register and issue permission to send the subject of excise duty in this regime.</seg>
<seg id="559">The SAO shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant consumer tax and also issue permission to send the subject of excise duty in the regime of conditional exemption from tax after its release into the customs regime “free circulation”.</seg>
<seg id="560">Grower Pallet</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of the cultivation washer is obtaining a permit for the production of alcohol in the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development SR.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the authorisation of the Ministry does not entitle the holder of the authorisation to operate the growing brandy.</seg>
<seg id="563">For the person could operate the cultivator's burning, the CÚ must apply for registration and issuance of a certificate of registration of the operator of the cultivator's burning.</seg>
<seg id="564">CÚ will issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which also entitles the operator of the cultivator's burning for the production of alcohol in the cultivation burning.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of the growing brandy is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Growing branlings cannot be tax in stock.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislator allows to apply a reduced tax rate on the hatch, up to 50% of the basic tax rate, i.e. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced tax rate is applied to the hatch made in the cultivation burns in the amount of 43 l a. on one grower and its household for one production period on the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period lasts from 1. 7. normal year until 30. 6th of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not identical to the calendar year and therefore it is possible to apply a reduced tax rate within one calendar year, because the hatch is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This is the production of alcohol outside the condition of conditional exemption from tax, which in practice means that the made hatch is located in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower for the made hatch pays the grower burnt not only the excise duty and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The Growth Pallet shall be issued by the cultivation sheet grower, which serves not only as a proof of proof of origin and the method of obtaining alcohol, but also for payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of such alcohol is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="575">Import of consumer packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of liabilities or cigarettes from the third state within the business and state it into the free tax circulation on the tax territory, ask the CÚ to include in the register of consumer packaging importers.</seg>
<seg id="577">The consumer packaging Importer does not register for the relevant consumer tax, but the CÚ will issue a confirmation of the classification in the register of consumer packaging importers.</seg>
<seg id="578">The aforementioned confirmation entitles the importer to import consumer packaging of alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the third state.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the audit stamps, the guarantee for tax on the amount of liabilities or cigarettes that wants to bring into the free tax circulation must be imposed before the audit.</seg>
<seg id="580">Consumer packaging Importance must be put into free tax circulation by only consumer packaging marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, the exports of the number and identification number of the audits exported in the third state must be submitted to the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="582">When importing, the importer is obliged to confirm the number of control stamps imported back from the third state.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds in the sense of customs regulations, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In case of discharge of the consumer packaging into the free tax circulation, the tax refund will return to the tax, or may be used for payment of customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">Consumer packaging Import is not a tax in stock.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the importer of the consumer packaging of the alcohol will also be a person authorized to distribute the alcohol, he is obliged to notify the CÚ business name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and barcode EAN for each new type of consumer packaging, which states in the free tax circulation, at the latest on the day of its launch.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of the consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">Due to the monitoring of alcohol movement in free tax circulation and elimination of tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute of the consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">The person who wants to be a holder of the sale permit must ask the CÚ to issue permission and meet the legal conditions (life permissions for business activity; integrity in relation to the intentional economic crimes; it was not taken over for the period of ten years for sale; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">Since it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required during the transport of this goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, the invoice that also contains the holder number for distribution is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of a consumer packaging of li alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="592">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to lead the number of received pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol, number of pieces issued by the consumer packaging of alcohol, status of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol to the last day of the month and record of manka or surplus in the number of received and issued consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to buy or otherwise withdraw to the consumer packaging within the business activities only from the person authorized to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="594">Consumer packaging Distributor of alcohol</seg>
<seg id="595">Due to the monitoring of alcohol movement in free tax circulation and elimination of tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute of consumer packaging distributor of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">The person who intends to be the holder of the distribution permit must ask the CÚ to issue the distribution authorization.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must comply with legal conditions (life permissions for business trade; storage area exceeds 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol at least 100 000 € or repaid basic assets at least CZK 100,000; minimum number of 10 employees; does not have fees against the customs office; does not have fees for compulsory drainage; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; it has not been taken over for the period of ten years for sale; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">Since it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required during the transport of this goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, the invoice, which also contains the holder number for distribution, is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of the consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="600">The distribution holder is obliged to keep the number of received pieces of the consumer packaging of liabilities, the number of pieces issued by the consumer packaging of the alcohol, the status of the alcohol supply in the consumer packaging of the alcohol for the last day of the month and the record of the manka or surplus in the number of received and issued consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="601">The distribution holder is obliged to buy the hatch in consumer packaging only from another person authorized to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorized to distribute announces the data for each calendar month electronically until the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Vendor of fuel</seg>
<seg id="604">Due to the monitoring of fuel in free tax circulation, as well as the elimination of tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, namely a fuel vendor.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no special regulation regulating the petrol station on the territory of Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="606">Therefore, the petrol stations in the national legislation of Slovakia are incorporated as vendors of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person who wants to sell petrol in a free tax circulation within the business activity of the tax area, diesel or LPG for final consumption, is obliged to ask the CÚ to issue a permit for sale and submit a document proving that the storage equipment is verified and equipped with a suitable verified measuring device enabling the income and dispensing to measure the amount of mineral oil, and the tank must be in accordance with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the vendor is a tax warehouse operator, the authorized recipient or registered sender, CÚ will also issue a permit for sale of fuel to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">In addition to other legal obligations, the vendor of fuel is obliged to maintain the records of the purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for a calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CÚ of a new supplier (distributor) of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="610">The vendor of fuel is legally obliged to buy or otherwise remove the fuel substances only from the fuel distributor or from the registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">Since it is a fuel substance in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required during the transport of this goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when the fuel is supplied through the autocistern, the distributor prints the so-called internship from the measuring device built in the autocistist.</seg>
<seg id="613">This document contains in addition to data relating to the quantity and delivery time and the registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, the invoice, which also contains a fuel distributor number allocated to the tax administrator, is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquiring fuel.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax administrator on the territory of Slovakia in the exercise of tax supervision above mineral oils records tax evasion related to transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="616">Above all, it is an effort to avoid the transport of road controls, so the carriers use the side road communication, they circumvent the system of selecting myth due to more difficult monitoring of real transport.</seg>
<seg id="617">The transport of mineral oils in rebuilt cisterns with double day is also carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times it happens that illegal transport is accompanied by a vehicle that the carrier reports possible mobile patrols for the purpose of changing the route and avoiding road control.</seg>
<seg id="619">Also, fuel mixing with light heating oils or waste oils occurs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel Distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">Due to the monitoring of fuel in free tax circulation, as well as for the purpose of eliminating tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, a distributor of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="622">The person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG, is obliged to ask the customs office for the issuance of a distribution permit and submit a document proving that the storage equipment is verified and equipped with a suitable verified measuring device as well as a list of suppliers and customers.</seg>
<seg id="623">In addition to other legal obligations, the fuel distributor is obliged to lead the records of the purchased and sold petrol separately for each plant, diesel or LPG per calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="624">Fuel distributor is legally obliged to buy or otherwise remove the fuel substances only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">Distributor of fuel can be sold on a tax area only by a fuel distributor, registered person or fuel consumption.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when supplying a fuel through an autocistern distributor, the vendor of fuel vendors or fuel, so-called internship from the measuring device built in the autocistist will be printed.</seg>
<seg id="627">This document contains in addition to data relating to the quantity and delivery time and the registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">Since it is a fuel substance in the free tax circulation, the accompanying document does not require the transport of this goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">For example, the invoice, which also contains a fuel distributor, or registered person, assigned to the tax administrator, is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="630">Consumer of fuel</seg>
<seg id="631">The consumer of fuel has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">The person who buys on the tax area in free tax circulation for their own consumption of petrol, diesel or LPG and this mineral oil stored in the storage facility, whose volume is 15,000 liters and more, is obliged to announce this fact the customs office no later than before the first placement in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">Consumer of fuel customs office shall be classified in the registration.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to legal facts, he is obliged to state the location of the storage equipment.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, companies engaged in road construction and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage equipment must be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the reception and dispensing to measure the amount of fuel (the built-in, specific rod).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must meet technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">Fuel consumer must buy fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">Since it is a fuel substance in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required during transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when supplying a fuel through an autocistern distributor, the consumer prints the so-called blocking from the measuring device built in the autocistist.</seg>
<seg id="641">This document contains, in addition to data relating to the quantity, date and delivery time and registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, the invoice, which also contains a fuel distributor number allocated to the tax administrator, is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquiring fuel.</seg>
<seg id="643">The tax administrator on the territory of Slovakia in the exercise of tax supervision above mineral oils records tax evasion related to transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer and meets the legal conditions within the business.</seg>
<seg id="646">Assuming compliance with the statutory conditions, small independent brewery may apply a reduced tax rate, i.e. 2,652 € per hl/property volume of real alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to a number of up to 200,000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">Since it is the production of beer outside the condition of conditional exemption from tax, a accompanying document is not needed for transport because it is located in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">Small independent brewery cannot be tax in stock.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family companies that also operate restaurants or bars in which they offer beer own production for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative acts in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter describes the performance of tax supervision of consumer tax management at selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was due to a larger number of transport in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="654">On the contrary, the biggest decline was recorded year on year in 2014, up to 4.3%, which was caused by a smaller number of terminated tax inspections and a smaller number of tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="655">The aforementioned decline concerned legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax inspections</seg>
<seg id="657">The output of the CÚ tax control detects or examines the facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">Employees of the CÚ demonstrate the authorization to exercise the tax inspection, which contains, among other things, the purpose and subject of control and the extent of the audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period may be one month, but also more tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The extent of the audited tax period determines the CÚ.</seg>
<seg id="661">Tax check begins with writing an entry to the commencement of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="662">The takeover of the CÚ documents will confirm.</seg>
<seg id="663">Lent documents are obliged to return to the SAO within 30 days of the end of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="664">The CÚ employee will prepare a protocol from tax control.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax control finds the difference in the sum that the audited tax entity should pay, or to which he claimed the tax refund, the CÚ shall also send a call to the audited tax entity by the audited tax entity by the call to express itself to the findings referred to in the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="666">Tax check is terminated on the day of delivery of the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="667">The deadline for the implementation of the tax inspection is at most one year from the date of its launch.</seg>
<seg id="668">Tax control for registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as needed, but at least one time to the day of termination of the law to determine the tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The SR of the SR issued an internal control act, which was modified the above deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax administrator on the territory of Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigation</seg>
<seg id="671">The local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in which it searches for evidence, examines and detects the facts necessary for tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">The employee of the CÚ shall be enrolled with the enrolment and its uniforms shall be submitted to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="673">When exercising a local investigation, the CÚ employee has the right to unlimited access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The clearing of the amount made of alcohol is determined in the form of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The found facts are the basis for the performance of tax control.</seg>
<seg id="676">Also in the performance of the local investigation, the CÚ is entitled to withdraw samples as well as to secure the thing.</seg>
<seg id="677">The SR has issued an internal control act, which regulated the performance of tax supervision and local investigation for individual items of consumables due to the unification of the tax administrator procedures.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on the hatch</seg>
<seg id="679">By joining the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1. 5. 2004 there was also a change in the field of consumer tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for a more efficient expenditure of the state budget on the administration of excise duty on alcohol, improving the business environment in the given area and the introduction of legislative tools for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the given area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought by a new legislative change was not only the transition of the tax administrator in the field of consumer tax administration in tax authorities to customs authorities, but also the introduction of the need for the presence of the tax administrator in tax stock on the hatch.</seg>
<seg id="682">On the territory of Germany, national taxatively defines that accepting, issuing, producing or processing hatch in the tax stock is possible only in the presence of CÚ employees.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse that receives, stores or sends the hatch only in the consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, CÚ is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse in order not to restrict income, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator is obliged to ensure the conditions of the working environment for employees of the CÚ.</seg>
<seg id="686">Based on the contract concluded with the SR for the premises provided a month, CÚ pays the tax warehouse operator costs for rent.</seg>
<seg id="687">In the tax warehouse in the production, processing or storage of alcohol, the storage of alcohol storage must be adapted to determine the amount of alcohol processed, processed alcohol, stored alcohol, including alcohol and alcohol reserves contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="688">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">If the hatch is not accepted in the tax warehouse, it does not issue, does not produce or process, the customs office may refrain from the obligation to secure the presence of an employee of the customs office, and is obliged to secure this space with the conclusion of the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this possibility is not used too often because the operators of tax warehouses use the continuous presence of employees of the customs office to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">467/2002 Z. z., on the production and placing of alcohol on the market, and use the production equipment for the production of alcohol in the distillery on the cultivation burning and also for the purposes of distillation on the distillates, which must be tax in stock.</seg>
<seg id="692">The performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on the hatch ensures approximately 250 customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issue of vouchers for the collection of trademarks on the hatch</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of trademarks is the sending of the application to the customs office by the allocation of the registration subscription number and the issue of the voucher for the purchase of checks on the hatch.</seg>
<seg id="695">Alcoholic beverage, which is the hatch, means the goods combined nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with real alcohol content exceeding 1.2 volume percent.</seg>
<seg id="696">The check mark is designed for labelling consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaging of alcohol is considered a closed consumer packaging filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging of the code combined nomenclature 2207 and 2208 can be put into free tax circulation on the tax area only if the check mark is marked.</seg>
<seg id="699">To mark the consumer packaging of the alcohol mark, the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorized recipient and the importer of the consumer packaging, which will bring him into the free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="700">The check mark contains, among other things, the identification number consisting of 14-digit numeric character. The identification number contains registration number (1.–6. instead of the numeric character), the alcohol volume (7.–11. instead of the numeric character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer package (12.–14. instead of a numeric character).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original pattern of control marks on the hatch:</seg>
<seg id="702">Registration subscription number assigns to each customer check mark separately.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a control mark, whose identification number corresponds to the volume of consumer packaging, the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging and the customer's control mark can be used to indicate the consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new information system of control stamps was to simplify and inform the ordering system, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control stamps intended for labelling consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">To mark the consumer packaging of the alcohol mark, the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorized recipient, the importer of the consumer packaging and the recipient (customer) of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="707">The customer of the inspection stamps who wants to take control marks according to the “new system” must apply the customs office for the issuance of the inspection stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the customer is obliged to ask for their release, to announce the data arising from the national legislation of Slovakia and to lead the registration of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of ordered pieces of control stamps must not be lower than 500 pieces or multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="710">Also, the tax administrator communicates with the customer of the checks of stamps through the electronic system of control stamps, especially when announcing the number of checks, which can remove the customer of the checks, or at the specified date of receipt of the control stamps by the customer of the control stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="711">The customer's check of the trademarks is obliged to fold the funds corresponding to the price of checks that may be removed and the amount of which will notify him of the customs office before accepting the inspection stamps.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the indicator takes into account the amount of substitute for the printer. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.</seg>

<seg id="723">Only a control mark, whose data corresponds to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarette pieces in the package, the length of cigarettes, the character of the tax rate and the registration number of the tax, can be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="724">Consumer packaging of cigarettes can be sold for final consumption only at the price, which is specified on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new information system of control stamps was to simplify and inform the ordering system, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control stamps intended for marking consumer packaging tobacco, cigar, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">The customer of the inspection stamps who wants to take control marks according to the “new system” must apply the customs office for the issuance of the inspection stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the customer is obliged to ask for their release, to announce the data arising from the national legislation of Slovakia and to lead the registration of control stamps.</seg>

<seg id="747">These are mainly applications for verification of entities within the management of excise duties, applications for information on the management of excise duty and also requests for confirmation of information from the database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications takes place in electronic form within the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following acts are included in the administrative cooperation between EU Member States: applications for administrative cooperation (application for verification, application for information about the management of excise duties, application for confirmation of registration in SEED); response to application for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; report on the event; report on control.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Compare</seg>
<seg id="752">Permission and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In Slovakia, a permanent tax supervision is applied for tax warehouses on the hatch, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by a continuous supervision of the tax administrator through the monitoring equipment.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax in stock, in Slovakia they are only registered by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Institute of registered sender, which is included in the Czech Republic among tax warehouses, is introduced in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="756">In Slovakia, it is possible to burn 43 l a.</seg>
<seg id="757">By contrast, the reduced alcohol tax rate can be applied only for 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Growth Pallet in Slovakia must have permission not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development SR, but also from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">Only the Ministry of Agriculture allows in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="760">In Slovakia, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is implemented in addition to the tax warehouse operator also importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The importer's permit is conditioned by the applicant's registered office at the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">No special tax administrator is required in the Czech Republic to import consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In Slovakia, the sale of consumer packaging is conditioned by issuing the tax administrator for the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of the consumer packaging of the alcohol has a statutory obligation to lead the registration of among others about the purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not give any permits for the final consumer packaging dealer, it is sufficient to release the concession for the sale of the alcohol trade office; the final seller does not lead any special register.</seg>
<seg id="766">In Slovakia, fuel vendor must have permission from the tax administrator to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">The National Legislation in Slovakia does not regulate any special regulation of the petrol station, all activities relating to petrol stations are regulated only in the Mineral Oil Consumer Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the petrol station regulates the special fuel law, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit for fuel sale.</seg>
<seg id="769">The petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Slovakia, the list of petrol stations is not technically possible from the financial administration system.</seg>
<seg id="771">Since 2012, the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities has been a significant increase in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="772">The above-mentioned increase was caused by legislative change in the given period.</seg>
<seg id="773">On the contrary, the number of selected permits in 2013 decreased significantly due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative acts</seg>
<seg id="775">In Slovakia, material legislation stipulates the obligation of tax control on selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue specifies the internal control act, which was issued by the Slovak Republic due to the application of a single procedure of tax administrators on the territory of Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, material legislation is obliged to do not regulate the performance of tax control, the processor regulation stipulates only the possibility of checking the check within the period for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for large differences in the number of tax inspections carried out and local investigations in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal control act of the SR is determined in which cases and within which deadlines the tax administrator must carry out tax control, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the amount of excise duty or its return is verified especially by the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative acts in the Czech Republic has increased due to the increase in the number of transport in the EMCS system and as a result of the increase in the number of tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="780">In Slovakia, the number of administrative acts between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly growing tendency that was affected by an increasing number of transport in the EMCS system and at the same time a decline in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">Different legislative regulation has been reflected in the large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in individual years.</seg>
<seg id="784">In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, seems approximately the same amount of administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="785">It is possible to state that Slovakia is focused more on the implementation of administrative tasks of the tax administrator, e.g. the performance of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, emphasis is placed more on remote monitoring, e.g. tracking equipment, immediate sending of data through the web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronization of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative acts in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be submitted through the data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic introduced the so-called interactive forms of tax returns, which can no longer be processed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must be further rewritten on the personal tax account of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is the restriction of errors filed by tax returns (DAP), which saves the acts of the tax administrator related to the management of error correction incorrectly submitted by DAP.</seg>
<seg id="793">GŘC works on the new application for electronic processing of DAP.</seg>
<seg id="794">Through intelligent forms, it is possible to apply for tax or registration for activities and notifications of changes to data, apply claims to tax refund, fulfil the notification obligations when handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco and fulfilling the obligations in the field of biofuels.</seg>
<seg id="795">The management of control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the information system ORO WebClient, which is available for registered entities for registration by the tax administrator of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic in the regime of conditional exemption from tax must be implemented in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic process document implemented in the Czech Republic as national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transport of selected products in free tax circulation after the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with proof proving their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, decision of the customs office on the release of selected products into customs regime, simplified accompanying document or other decision on the assessment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is determined by legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (§ 5 and § 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows a deciduous form to replace or supplement the electronically exhibited documents, which are sent to the data warehouse via the Customs Administration web interface, where it is assigned a unique twelve-digit identification code (JIK) to each such document.</seg>
<seg id="801">JIK serves for the purposes of checking customs authorities on the way and prevents repeated transport to the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">The largest tax warehouse operator in the Czech Republic, which lists roughly half of the PHM volume into free tax circulation, has CS ČR online access to the electronic registration system to which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS ČR is considering introducing e-VDO, i.e. electronic system for records and monitoring of transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should be used from 70% of the existing EMCS specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for declarations and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to the system of global guarantees, to register tax entities or to a risk analysis system.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow an overview of the transport in free circulation between Member States, which still works on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of meeting numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risk of the current process of registration of the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in abuse of a simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronization of administrative acts in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="810">When managing consumer taxes, the Financial Administration of the SR uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system in conditional liberation mode from tax, inspection stamps, administration of tax returns and also during registration and registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, one-way electronic communication of tax entities was also introduced with the tax administrator, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">Within the framework of electronic communication, the tax entity has access to the personal internet zone, so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">As part of this zone, the tax entity has access to the electronic mailbox, through which the application is submitted, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the management of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are mainly the taxpayer of value added tax, tax advisor representing the tax entity and attorneys representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">The SAO also dealt with the issue of electronicisation of consumer tax management during control.</seg>
<seg id="818">It was only a fully electronic tasks, about tax returns and electronic communication within the ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">If the transport carried out in the EMCS system, the electronicisation of selected comparable administrative acts has increased, which is also a requirement placed on modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Compare</seg>
<seg id="822">It is already established in Slovakia fully electronized processing of tax returns from its submission to the registration of tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility to insert compulsory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation is set for tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the announcement of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting the transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thereby eliminating the transport of selected products where excise tax was not paid in conflict with legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">It is possible to recommend it as a good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in Slovakia in the field of electronicisation of tax returns, the SAO recommends to complete the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes to the organizational structure and personnel security in the field of excise duty</seg>
<seg id="832">Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic underwent major changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">Customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 consists of the Directorate-General of Customs and customs authorities, which are administrative authorities and organizational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">GŘC is an accounting unit for the whole customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic performs comprehensive management of excise duties from 2004 as one of the many competencies provided.</seg>
<seg id="837">The CS ČR also performs:</seg>
<seg id="838">a) control:</seg>
<seg id="839">₱ in the field of road transport (weight of trucks, payment of fees for the use of roads, fulfilling the conditions for the transport of hazardous costs, professional supervision of the work of vehicles of vehicles in international road freight transport and in matters of international transport of persons),</seg>
<seg id="840">₱ waste management and packaging material,</seg>
<seg id="841">₱ safety of imported foods,</seg>
<seg id="842">₱ in the field of consumer protection and intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">₱ employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">(b) administration of customs duties – it is a complex application of customs regulations, commercial political measures and formalities in import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">c) the selection and enforcement of financial performance stored by other public administration bodies within the divided administration,</seg>
<seg id="846">(d) the activities of the police body (sent customs authorities) in proceedings on crimes committed by breach of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the scope of competence (the audit of control activities) increases the total cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, however, costs from the extent, as the public administration may not incur expenditure on the position of a control group for each subject of control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden on controlled persons is reduced by repeated control.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic performs further from 1. 12. 2016 competence for verifying the fulfilment of obligations in the registration of revenues (§ 2 para. 112/2016 Coll., on the Registration of Sales) and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of gambling operation, including the storage of sanctions (§ 116 of Act No 186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">Within the framework of the Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has changed effective from 1. 1. 2013 three-stage structure on two-stage, the middle article of the proceedings (total headquarters) was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="851">The GŘC spent approximately CZK 51 million on the project (i.e. approx. 2 031 000 €).</seg>
<seg id="852">CS ČR from 1. 1. 2013 consists of GŘC and regional customs authorities, which are administrative authorities and organizational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs authorities and their competencies stipulate the law, administration of excise duties carried out by all customs authorities through the department and territorial workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial workplaces are internal organizational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">Establish and interfere with the territorial workplace and determine their competence is entitled to the Ministry of Finance by decree.</seg>
<seg id="856">Legislation shall not stipulate any competence for territorial workplaces; the territorial workplace performs competence of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organizational structure until 31. 12. 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organizational structure from 1. 1. 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Administrative tax management until 31. 12. 2012 performed GŘC, eight CŘ and 58 department of the CÚ (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 departments and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">K 1. 1. 2016 carried out the management of excise tax GŘC and 51 department at the CÚ and their territorial workplaces, eight workplaces of the legal department of the GŘC and the CÚ departments ensuring mobile supervision, i.e. approx. 60 seats.</seg>
<seg id="861">CS ČR costs most importantly affect wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there was no savings in personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in the service relationship according to the Act on the Services ratio of members of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility to reduce the numbers of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to § 42 para. 361/2003 Coll., on the service ratio of members of the security forces, can be dismissed from the service ratio only in cases of taxatively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of service points due to organizational changes in the security corps is not a reason for the release and the employer is obliged to provide members of the allocation of corresponding services within the congregation, or to ensure business sites with other security corps (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise it is transferred to a backup for temporarily not assigned to members of the security forces according to the Act 80% of the average service income.</seg>

<seg id="868">As one of the priorities of the completion of the reform of tax administration through UNITAS, the government of the Slovak Republic, the government of the Slovak Republic, as one of the priorities of the completion of the reform of tax administration and suppression of tax evasion, will ensure additional budgetary resources.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, tax reform was implemented at the central level, which brought the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic to the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the emergence of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">FŘ SR was set up for 1. 1. 333/2011 Z. z., on the bodies of state administration in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization, which is based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="885">In addition to the Czech Republic, the management of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic was engaged in 74 organizational departments with a total number of 1,300 employees; these departments manage almost 48,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the framework of the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, approximately 60 organizational departments with a total number of 1,011 employees dealt with the administration of excise duties in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of consumer tax administration is divided into several personically independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their mutual coordination and cooperation is solved through medium and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In Slovakia, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax returns, tax inspection) in the field of consumer tax administration is divided between the department of excise duty and the branch of the customs office, which often deal with the same employees of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">Approximately a third number of tax entities on the total number of employees in the field of consumer tax management compared to the state in the Czech Republic are approximately a third, the effect of a higher number of employees on the effectiveness of consumer tax management is not obvious.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 1152/2003/EC of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty was the aim of introducing an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products to allow the transport of information in real time and to perform prescribed inspections, simplify the movement of goods inside the Community in the condition with conditional liberation from excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing the system, Member States should be active in this sector, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises in this sector, to enable the use of these national elements with the lowest possible costs.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of the aforementioned EP and Council decisions admits in order to include national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such technical or software, which Member State considers necessary to ensure complete use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS is fully functional in the Czech Republic from 1. 4. 2010 and continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">The so-called customs module and declaration module were introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">Above the Community system, transport in the condition of conditional exemption from tax started in the Czech Republic is monitored in the Czech Republic in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="903">After approval of the notification of the admission of the shipment intended for the legitimate recipient for one-off acceptance of automatic sending of the information into the register of tax entities with subsequent invalidation of the permit.</seg>
<seg id="904">The administration of received and sent applications for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO including sending responses with annex in any format and translations is ensured through the system.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a manual for manual termination of exports at the ECS (in the EU only assignment of the automatically created report is implemented).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS system does not allow to approve e-AD or notifications of acceptance without the reaction of the relevant customs authority to the risk profile (risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The Declarant module is available for tax entities for free, it has a form of web application to which the user logs in to the user name and password (coordinates) that are assigned to him after registration with CS ČR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each act towards the EMCS module must be equipped with a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declarant module allows tax entities to direct enrolment of data on commenced and terminated transport in conditional exemption mode from tax, and tax entities may not incur funds for the acquisition of the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">National functionalities of the declarant module allow to load and store off-line data (saves time at often used data), fill in the recipient data based on SEED ID control and require mandatory completion of data, which are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for each shipment sent from the Czech Republic in real time to block the provision of excise duty in the corresponding amount of taxable performance until the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The EMCS system is calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient provision, the declaration module EMCS is not allowed to send a proposal for e-AD to approval for the CÚ shipment.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each guarantee has a unique number and contains ARC transport (including the amount of blocked secured), for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked guarantee of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="917">Spending on the introduction and use of the EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of the EMCS was implemented on the basis of eight contracts with the fulfilment from 2006 to 2017 in the total amount of 46 791 924,60 CZK (i.e. 1 761 412,56 €) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued a invoice for the total amount of 43 577 255,19 CZK (i.e. 1 640 401,10 €) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="920">expenditure of 14 545 454 CZK excl.VAT (i.e.) were spent on the EMCS system upgrade. 547 438,99 €).</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade in the audited period and converted to one transport inserted into the EMCS is on average 16.49 CZK (i.e. 0,62 €), without national transport, these expenditures are at one transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States 24,40 CZK (i.e. 0,92 €).</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS Technical Support was implemented on the basis of four contracts with a full performance from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support in the amount of CZK 7 499 675 was invoiced (i.e. 281 389,77 €) including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average technical support amounted from 2011 to one transport inserted into the EMCS since 2010 is 6.18 CZK (i.e. 0,23 €).</seg>
<seg id="925">The invoices for development and technical support concerned the national solution and there was a development of the EVV application, which the GŘC already operated before the EMCS system itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were covered within the programme financing from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the deliveries of services and other applications that the supplier provides for the Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS system is an electronic system operated by EU Member States in order to monitor the movement of goods subject to consumer tax between Member States in the condition of conditional exemption from tax.</seg>
<seg id="930">He paid the accompanying administrative document – SAD, which was used before the effectiveness of this system and thus secured better control and control of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="931">In Slovakia it is introduced from 1. 4. 2010 and continuously supplemented with the requirements arising from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated on each transport, so-called.</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which it can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS system ensures acceptance and sending of goods subject to consumer tax only by such tax entities that are entitled to use the EMCS system, thereby significantly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when the EMCS system was fully introduced into operation (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Spending on the introduction and use of the EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of the EMCS system was implemented as another module of application equipment SysNeD, and therefore it is not possible to determine the amount of costs for its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Compare</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of the EMCS was to replace the system based on transport administration in paper form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The contribution of the EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between individual Member States within the EU from the announcement of transport launch to termination – the reduction of administrative costs for the tax administrator and tax entities for processing, transfer and archiving of documents is significant.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, national functionality was introduced to the EMCS system allowing monitoring of transport in a conditional system between two places in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and ensuring the guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">The national functionality is also introduced, which monitors the risk of a tax entity or transport, with a subsequent compulsory response of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="946">SR and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of transport within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, the expenditure spent in Slovakia on the upgrade of this system was 744 310,01 € higher in 2012 to 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO has received data on the EMCS upgrade from the Czech Republic only for the period since 2011, although this system has been introduced and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Nevertheless, the expenditure spent on the EMCS system upgrade in Slovakia was 188 134,44 € higher than the expenditure for the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system for about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">During the audited period, the volume of expenditure related to the EMCS upgrade in Slovakia in the conversion to one passenger transport exceeds the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR fulfilled the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both control institutions have gained a deeper knowledge of the consumer tax management system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="955">It has been found that through the common basic legal framework there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the effectiveness of consumer tax management.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel inspections, examples of good practice were found, which could contribute to limiting tax fraud, their importance with increasing tax rates will grow.</seg>
<seg id="957">The procedures decreasing the costs of consumer tax management were also identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation revealed differences that significantly affect the effectiveness of tax administration and restrict international comparison if they are not carried out by mutually coordinated depth control at the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of the highest audit institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of parallel control of value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Úvodní slovo</seg>
<seg id="3">The Limská Declaration of 1977 emphasizes that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) have the power to carry out the audit of all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration asks for income from taxes to be checked in as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The organization of the European Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers one of the most important parts of public tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="6">VI. EUROSAI Congress held in 2005 in Bonn dealt with the audit of public income carried out by SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">An important step on the way to optimize the SAI control activities is the elaboration of a special strategy for public income audit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It concerns especially taxes as the most numerous source of public income, which is most susceptible to great losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the economy of individual countries is becoming more and more connected and dependent, the SAI may be unable to perform control activities without cooperation with the SAI of another country to some extent.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organized fraud, which acts substantial losses in income of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">To fight this crime, it is necessary that the responsible authorities cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAI, which performs control in this area, must be willing to build closer cooperation between each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea of the management of value added tax administration (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT”) and the VIES system within the cooperation of the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">A careful preparation followed, when both parties had to first acquaint themselves with the legal environment and procedures for VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was carried out, which was included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving effective and executive VAT management is a long-term problem and individual states (especially Member States of the European Union) are looking for a solution to improve, simplify and clarify the selection of this tax.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our control can be used not only for improving the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for the proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel control of value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of control:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Taxation of value added tax after entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Verification of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Goal of control:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the inclusion of the Czech Republic into the unified internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”) associated with free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, especially when controlling the claim for exemption from value added tax for intra-Community delivery.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the intra-community tax control system with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax according to the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">The system of exchange of value added information The auditing operation was carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “NKÚ”) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the “BRH”) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two control institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cooperation focused mainly on verification of selected commercial transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “ČR”) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as “SRN”), use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrators and comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Common final report on the results of the auditing events was processed in the sense of the European Directive 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period was from 1. 5. 2004 until 31. 12. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control events</seg>
<seg id="33">Parallel control in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAI.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the main point – exchange of information on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – it covered the audit of other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT tax returns and aggregate reports, which are closely connected with the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Moreover, the audit included the legal situation in the field of international bus transport of passengers and comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">Comparison of VAT management systems of both countries has been found differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic is the first criterion (except others) to register the limit set out in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is assigned to payers, which also use during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the payers are assigned a tax number for VAT, serving only for business transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">Because different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be balanced throughout the EU (see. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus transport of persons.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, the international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with a claim for VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, part of the transport, which takes place on the German territory, is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">At EU level, efforts should be made to harmonize the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common VAT system (see. 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) Tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic the payers submit tax returns only for individual taxation periods (month or quarter), in Germany, the payers are obliged to submit so-called preliminary tax return VAT (month or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns to the Czech Republic electronically would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While the payers submit aggregate reports on the financial authorities in the Czech Republic, the payers submit aggregate reports on CLO in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="53">The financial authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have data from aggregate reports available immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">German tax authorities have information from aggregate reports available only after their processing to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">The fight with VAT fraud requires that updated information about intra-Community transactions is available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">The monthly submission of aggregate reports would shorten the time shift between the date of transaction and data updates in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would subsequently allow timely verification of taxation in the Member State of the Provider (see. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">Which, but required all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submission of a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors the compliance with a three-month period in the delivered applications.</seg>
<seg id="61">German CLO does not follow the past time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax administration handled significantly lower percentage of delivered applications within the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Due to these problems BRH recommended the German CLO implementation of permanent alerts (see. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States develops their own risk management system (risk management system, as well as “RMS”), which has its strong and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH warn that the effective RMS cannot be developed only by one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, components and approaches RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise the deceivers will select a Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">The cooperation examined both SAI selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together with the use of the CLO legislation, thirty-one cases of business transactions have been verified, where doubts have existed for their implementation or suspicion of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the financial authorities used the information obtained in the form of international cooperation and the tax obligation to pay tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers are either unauthorized to claim the exemption of deliveries from VAT, or did not admit the purchase of goods in the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information, because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used due to various legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration rejected another Member State at the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">There were cases where the payers incorrectly reported business transactions in aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, data in VIES were incorrect and tax administration had to examine these cases (see. 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">Progress of the audit action</seg>
<seg id="79">Progress of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The auditing operation was carried out from June 2006 to March 2007 Department II – by separating income of the state budget and territorial trade unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as the “MF”) and 10 financial offices – the Financial Office in Humpolci, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4 Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The SAO Board approved the auditing conclusion from this auditing operation on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Progress of the auditing operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out in the period from June 2006 to February 2007 a control group for indirect taxes and staff intended for regional control authorities in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The auditing operation was part of the audit plan for 2006 and was therefore announced by the Federal MF in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the test phase, the check was started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">Depending on the case of selected BRH and later elected SAO, BRH had to announce a number of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to interviews at the Federal MF and CLO, the inspection was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Dolní Sasko, North Rhine -Vestphalia, Rhine-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax writings of the following financial authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for corporations/ legal entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-centre (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large businesses (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-sever), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn center (Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne Wednesday (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, there was negotiations with the Financial Office Augsburg-city (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old city (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The report on the audit found was filed by MF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation of both control institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">Several meetings of representatives of both control institutions took place during the preparation of parallel control events in the period before their commencement.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants of these meetings met with the organisation of tax administrators, with legislative regulation of the VAT issue and with the VAT administration system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">The meeting, which took place in May 2006, was agreed on the topics of the test phase.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated on another joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">As part of this meeting, the schedule of further work progress was agreed and the following topics of parallel controls were determined:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registration of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus transport of persons - legislative regulation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators in handling applications for information and verification of selected problem cases referred to in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical data on delivery and purchase of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. Risk management in the VAT sector.</seg>
<seg id="110">On the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, both parties met each other with the course of control in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of parallel control events.</seg>
<seg id="111">The report on the results of parallel inspections of VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was elaborated on a working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Taxation of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Plans who have a seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter referred to as the “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”) means a taxpayer, taxpayer and a legal successor to a natural or legal person who is defined as a tax entity by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31. 12. 2004 a total of 421 865 tax entities were registered in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">K 1. 12. 2005 there was an increase in the number of tax entities registered for VAT to 457 590.</seg>
<seg id="118">The person compulsory for a tax registered, instead of a business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds the next 12 previous consecutive calendar months amounting to CZK 1,000,000 (33 575 EUR), becomes the payer from 1st day of the third month following the month in which the registration limit exceeded (§ 94 para. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; only “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).</seg>
<seg id="119">The registration application is required to submit this person within 15 days after the month in which the registration limit exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legal regulation does not allow you to register a person compulsory to tax the so-called back in cases where the reason for registration is exceeding the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A person compulsory for tax based, a place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, which takes place taxable performance or performance exempt from VAT with a claim for deduction, may become a taxpayer, although it does not exceed CZK 1,000,000 (33 575) if it meets one of the other conditions referred to in Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">The person compulsory for tax based, a place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, which does not meet any of the conditions stipulated by law, may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure under Act No.337/1992 Coll. is initiated by Delivery of the application for registration of the locally competent tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="124">The voluntary VAT payer shall also specify the date for which the VAT payer asks for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. filled in for registration with all annexes, will verify.</seg>
<seg id="126">If doubts about the data mentioned above, the tax entity will call on the data to explain, supplement or document.</seg>
<seg id="127">After the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, it will issue a decision in the form of a certificate that the tax entity is registered and tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT n”) was assigned to it.</seg>
<seg id="128">The tax administrator will present the date of registration for VAT and periodicity of the taxation period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period is the calendar quarter, if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (335 750 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (335 750), the tax period of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">The payer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (67 150 EUR), is entitled to choose the calendar month for the tax period and will notify the tax administrator this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The assignment of the VAT number in the registration certificate always has a constitutive character and the tax entity is obliged to provide them in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases stipulated by the special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. on the issuance of tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The VAT number contains the code “CZ” and the trunk part consisting of a general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier is a birth number at a natural person or. another general identifier, if the special law stipulates so, and the legal entity of the identification number (management of § 33 para. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax entity did not fulfil its registration obligation or on the call administrator's call, it registers the local tax administrator immediately from the official obligation.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issue of the Ex officio registration certificate, which is delivered to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, the tax entity who received the authorization for business activities was assigned to the VAT number at the time of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same VAT number is also used by the tax entity if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1. 1. 2005, the tax administrator may impose a mandatory compensation for the tax refund up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable performance in the event of failure to comply with the registration obligation, which took place by this person unauthorized without tax, for the period from the date to which the registered payer should be from the law, to the date on which the tax administrator has become a registered payer (the establishment of § 98 para. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the specified amount is considered tax deduction (§ 98 para. 3 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. It is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">Cancellation of the VAT payer registration is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, especially from the title of turnover, which does not reach the registration limit (§ 106 para. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer is entitled to request the cancellation of the registration first after 1 year from the date of effectiveness specified on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of registration “from power official” (§ 106 para. 235/2004 Coll.) if: a) the payer did not take place without notice the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be mandatory for tax.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Senters who do not have a seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for a tax in another Member State, which does not have a seat, a place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign person compulsory for a tax that will take place with the place of fulfilment in the Czech Republic and is a compulsory award and pay tax on this performance pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called “unsettled payer”), becomes a payer on the day of realization of this performance.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to apply for registration of the Financial Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of performance.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the registration application, it is obliged to provide all VAT number assigned to it in other Member States or in the third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If the “unsettled” payer shall apply for registration later than as of the date of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 registers it retroactively, because according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax entity became a VAT payer as of the date of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">During the retroactive registration, the Financial Office requires Prague 1 from tax entities documenting that the performance was carried out (factors, or. explaining letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If the “unsettled” tax entity asks for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable performance is made, then the Financial Office for Prague 1 asks for submitting contracts that the performance will take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">The Financial Office for Prague 1 was as of 31. 12. 2004 registered 473 “unsettled” payers, of which 124 slices from Germany, and as of 31. 12. 2005 was registered 951 “unsettled” payers, of which 233 payers from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Under § 106 para. 235/2004 Coll. is the tax administrator entitled to cancel the registration “unsettled” payers as of 31 January of the following calendar year if there is no obligation to admit and pay tax during the regular calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SAO audit found that if the “unsettled” payer fits the tax return abroad to the postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal regulation in the deadline for filing a tax return, the tax office is often not available on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts are decisive for the possibility of repealing the registration of the tax office known later than as of 31 January, the Czech Republic is no longer able to cancel the registration for VAT in the given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, only “AO”), anyone who develops business activities is obliged to inform the city/general office or the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information processes the city/general office for the financial office.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax office finds an enterprise that started the activity but did not register, the relevant tax office may register this payer from the power of official – and retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are tax residents and tax non-residents in Germany are obliged to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (hereinafter referred to as “UStG”).</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover implementing.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax authorities for entrepreneurs permanently living abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those who are based in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office Chemnitz-Süd is the relevant Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="167">A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Financial Office Chemnitz-Süd, as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">BRH found that these special financial authorities often rejected the registration of so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new Eastern Member States of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the work permit of employees from ten new EU Member States is limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These businesses do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Section 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer who determines their working hours and the way they perform work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must fill in the questionnaire of the relevant tax office in which he must provide information about the company and the activities carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire represents a standard form that is binding for all financial authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of financial authorities or departments with a general focus that corresponds to the assessment of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">Through this form, the risk of individual taxpayers is carried out before the tax office issued a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the Financial Office, another five (or four) are to distinguish the payers, the last one is always the control digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs an identification number for VAT purposes (VAT ID) to receive intra-Community delivery exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="178">CLO assigns VAT ID to the entrepreneur's request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if the tax number has for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="179">CLO assigns VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when the payers will provide intra-Community delivery in their VAT award.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a number of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Entrepreneur's registration can be cancelled: 1st at his request (for example, if he completed his business activity), after the execution of all administrative works (the assessment for all economic years) and 2nd if the tax administration realizes that they no longer develop business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the identification number for VAT purposes is usually bound to the validity of the tax number for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="183">The financial authorities are obliged to inform CLO about the cancellation of the tax number in these cases so that CLO may end the validity of the identification number for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the German VAT Act (Section 19 (1) UStG) tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in the case of 1st that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed CZK 1,500 and the 2nd in the following year probably does not exceed EUR 50,000.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small entrepreneurs (“Kleinunternehmer”) are not entitled to invoice to other VAT entrepreneurs and are not entitled to tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although VAT must not be paid, small entrepreneurs must be registered at the Financial Office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">The small entrepreneur may declare that the provisions of § 19 paragraph will not be provided. 1 UStG to apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This confession is binding on the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The entrepreneur may then invoice VAT and deduct the entry tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For tax non-residents there is a possibility to appoint tax representatives (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The necessary prerequisite is to take exclusively business operations exempt from tax and not be entitled to deduction of tax on entry.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">Information on representation for tax purposes must be specified on invoices.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic is the first criterion (except others) to register the limit set out in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax entity does not exceed the tax entity in the Czech Republic, it has the opportunity to ask for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but due to different organizational models in federal states, differences may occur.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned to the VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same VAT number even during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the payer is assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for business transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH found out, the German two-stage registration system can operate many misunderstanding in other Member States, as in the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system enables retroactive (national) registration in cases where the payers refuse to inform the municipalities or the relevant tax office of their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct VAT assessment for the previous tax period, especially the exact estimate of the tax obligation for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">Because different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be balanced throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the VAT number).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Office for Tax will be added to the VAT number at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This VAT number will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office shall apply for an economic VAT number that will be used as VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, it should not be delayed between the national registration of the payer and by allocating VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the introduction of IT means to the administration of the VAT number was not yet terminated.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus transport of persons</seg>
<seg id="214">Legal regulation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to § 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. is valid from 1. 5. 2004 transport of persons between Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic exempt from VAT with a claim for tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="216">This transport is exempt from VAT, although entrepreneurs who are registered for tax in other Member States are carried out, or foreign persons compulsory tax.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return transport is considered a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If the “unsettled” tax entities in the Czech Republic do not operate in addition to international bus transport by persons of another economic activity, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International transport of persons was exempt in the Czech Republic from VAT on the basis of the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex In the Capital. 5 para. 1 letter. b) where it is stated:</seg>
<seg id="220">“For the purposes of Art. 28 para. 3 letter. b) Directive 77/388/EEC may continue to exempt from value added tax for international passenger transport according to paragraph 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition set out in Art. 28 para. 4 Directive or for the period when the same exemption is applied to some existing Member State, depending on what occurs earlier.”</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of legal regulation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in § 3b paragraph. 1 German VAT Act is a place of providing passenger transport (i.e. transport services) route (i.e. place where the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the route that takes place in Germany represents taxable provision of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If the tax non-resident passenger travels through Germany, then the part of the route that takes place in Germany represents also taxable provision of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">The tax non-resident must notify your intention to provide the transport of passengers with the relevant tax office before it takes place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The Financial Office registers this tax non-resident to the tax (cf. 4.1.2) and will issue a special certificate for any bus or car park specified in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to admit his taxable provision of transport in the German tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Financial Office Chemnitz-Süd 741 Czech slicers who did in transport of passengers registered.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport of passengers is provided to a tax resident who is a mandatory VAT for VAT, the tax non-resident may not pay VAT to the tax office itself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity who is obliged to take VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount of the tax non-resident is a tax resident who is the recipient of the service; this process is known as “transferring tax obligation” and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the tax non-resident and its tax return, the German tax administration has several funds to assess the correctness of the granted taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of the customs office carry out the audit certificate of buses with permission (license) to foreign transport used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, they send a mobile control group to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to request VAT payment from the bus driver before the next transport continues.</seg>
<seg id="237">The tax non-resident may be deducted by the VAT paid out of the tax calculated in its VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the Financial Office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT tax return, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit that must be carried out in the office of the Financial Office, or may use the funds of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT measured in accordance with its legal rate, the tax office may apply for administrative cooperation according to Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If a review of a VAT tax return is to be carried out or the fulfilment of the obligations of a tax non-resident, BRH considers all these funds administrative cooperation as too demanding in terms of labour compared to small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the accounting audit of the tax non-resident raises disproportionate costs both for taxpayer and for tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">Tax administration must carry out an audit of foreign accounting, which does not only mean the need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">At the audit of this type, it is also likely that it will require more time than the audit of the tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport, which takes place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the tax non-resident may not only accept the right to check which its national tax administration belongs, but also the right to carry out the audit by other Member States in which passengers transport.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, in each Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport is held, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all tax obligations that apply to him in these Member States in all languages and on all tax forms of these Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The real taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore raises disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is transported, based on the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic exempt from VAT with a claim to deduct tax.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport, which takes place on the German territory taxable performance.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport provides an unsettled payer for the first time in Germany, it is obliged to notify the relevant tax office in advance.</seg>
<seg id="252">The Financial Office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to admit taxable provision of a part of the transport in the tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">The implementation of the law is very time consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered on the Financial Office Chemnitz-Süd operate in the transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the efforts, the tax revenue is, if implemented, rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States that collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, on the common VAT system, are burdened with the time consuming obligations without financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">To prevent disproportionate costs for VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should be taxed only in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be a state where the transport starts or where the provider is based.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require adjustment of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">Tax return to VAT</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The taxpayer is obliged to file a VAT return tax return within 25 days of the end of the tax return to the Ministry prescribed by MF, even if the tax obligation did not arise if the law does not stipulate otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The tax obligation is due within the deadline for filing a tax return on VAT, except for tax excluded in connection with the import of goods pursuant to § 20 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the tax maturity is determined by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">It will be created – if a refundable fee is refundable due to excessive deduction, the payers will return without request within 30 days of the assessment of excessive deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator will start tax proceedings concerning the payer's tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with § 73 para. 235/2004 Coll. may be entitled to tax deduction in the proper tax return of VAT no later than the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for tax deduction could be applied.</seg>
<seg id="267">After this period, it is possible to apply the tax deduction within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the claim for tax deduction could be applied first.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is possible only in the form of an additional tax return.</seg>
<seg id="269">Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1. 1. 2005 allows the administration of an additional tax return only for the period when it could be entitled to deduction of tax for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) a summary of the repairs increases the tax obligation, b) performs a correction in which the last known tax obligation does not change, but only the data of the tax entity previously claimed, c) performs the correction of the rate and the amount of tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the summary of the repairs reduces the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="272">Additional tax returns are obliged to submit the payer until the end of the month following the findings of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">Submission of a VAT tax return in electronic form can be implemented both through the Internet or on the technical data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">The submission after the Internet can be made as a submission with a data message provided with a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message unattained by a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In case of submission with the data message, the guaranteed electronic signature is still required in writing, i.e. the delivery of the computer report to the tax administrator (e-printing).</seg>
<seg id="276">Tax return to VAT contains separate lines relating to intra-community delivery/device of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated control within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">Values of delivery of goods to other Member States to persons registered for tax in other Member States shall be compared with the data referred to in summary reports submitted by Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of purchasing goods from other Member States from persons registered for tax in other Member States are compared with the values obtained through the VIES system from aggregate reporting of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The Financial Office takes place within the ADIS system of credibility of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test takes place automatically, because without the test it is not possible to measure VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test includes the calculation of credibility criteria and assessing the risk types of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Under § 37 para. 337/1992 Coll. may be the tax office of the one who does not meet the obligation of unmonetary nature, resulting from this or special tax law, or the imposed decision under this Act, repeatedly impose a fine up to CZK 2,000,000 (67 150 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system, which FÚ uses for technical support of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The SAO audit found that the financial authorities usually did not use the possibility to save the payers for the failure to submit a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT tax returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and a annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit a preliminary VAT return must thus present an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">The annual tax return must even be small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="291">Generally, taxpayers are obliged to submit a quarterly VAT return to the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT (§18 para. 2 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the tax obligation of VAT exceeds 6 136 EUR in the previous calendar year or if it is a newly established enterprise, the competent entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return to the 10th day in the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to submit a monthly VAT return if the tax refund has been refunded last year, which exceeded CZK 6 136 (§18 para. 2a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT confession may not be administered if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of the VAT tax obligation must be paid within 10th day of the month following the tax period in which VAT was established.</seg>
<seg id="296">The tax refund can lead to a more detailed investigation by the FÚ.</seg>
<seg id="297">The deadlines (according to the law) for the processing of tax returns and the refund of excessive VAT deduction do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to return the tax, it is possible to offer the amount to be returned.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process a VAT tax return and return the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act sets out the possibility of extended this period (§ 18 para. 6 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">For such extension it is necessary to ask separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">Allows to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant tax obligation of VAT a month later, provided that a special deposit is paid in case of a monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This deposit payment will be balanced compared to the December tax obligation of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is found, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">Additional VAT returns does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="306">As soon as the annual VAT return returns to the following calendar year, the entrepreneur cannot correct the incorrect preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return tax return.</seg>
<seg id="307">The correction of the annual VAT tax return for the benefit or failure of the payer is possible within the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return tax return was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual tax return may be normally corrected only in cases of tax fraud or leaks.</seg>
<seg id="309">The taxpayers are obliged to submit a preliminary tax return electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">Financial authorities may apply exceptions from this rule to prevent disproportionate hardness.</seg>
<seg id="311">The administration of the annual VAT return is possible in paper form or through the Internet, either with certification or without it.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is made without certification, the payers must file a return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">If the payer does not submit a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to carry out a gross estimation of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In case of delayed submission, the payers may be imposed penalty (maximum 10% tax to be paid or 25 000 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="315">BRH found out that the financial authorities often do not measure this standard fine during the previous audit.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases, when the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was measured inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard penalty therefore does not fulfil its target to shorten the average delay, especially when filing a annual VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="318">Tax return to VAT contains separate lines related to intra-Community delivery/device of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="320">Untaxable transactions must be reported on a separate line of tax return/ VAT.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the event of a VAT return submitted in paper form, a copy must be taken either through a scanner or employees who are specially authorized.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from VAT returns submitted electronically has a financial office worker immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all data is entered into the system, the RMS department staff will pass and make a selection of cases that correspond to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The selected VAT return must check the financial office worker on the basis of a control report prepared by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration must roughly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer must pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, tax return tax returns to 25 days after the taxation period are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the amount of the payer's turnover, the tax period is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, the payers submit preliminary tax returns, depending on the tax obligation in the previous year either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May the following year, the payers are obliged to submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">Obligation to submit an annual tax return to its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ the end of the calendar year is able to correct errors in (month preliminary) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the payer fixes the confessed intra-Community transaction, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the summary report is submitted;</seg>
<seg id="335">– Federal states usually do not disclose data from the VIES intra-Community acquisition of German payers before processing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see. 4.1.3) are the German payers obliged to submit an annual tax return of VAT independently of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German financial body to examine the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">Moreover, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT return with direct taxes and final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from the tax returns filed from the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, the taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit tax returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to submit a tax return electronically to increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of aggregate reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The summary report (hereinafter referred to as the “SH”) shall be submitted under § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. of the payer who made the delivery of goods to another Member State registered to a tax on another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the delivered goods are always stated in the Czech currency in the subdivision according to individual tax entities indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on the services provided are not stated to SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH submitted to payers with monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter up to 25 days after its end of the locally competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="348">Fix of incorrect data is done in subsequent SH within 15 days of the error detection date.</seg>
<seg id="349">Error data specified in SH always replace the data specified in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">As well as tax returns, the payers and SH can submit in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer does not submit SH or subsequent SH and should submit them under Act No. 235/2004 Coll. on the Act, the tax administrator shall call it to its submission and at the same time teach it about the consequences in the case of submitting SH or subsequent SH, i.e. the fact that the tax administrator is entitled to impose a fine up to CZK 2,000,000 (67 150 EUR) in accordance with § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. for failure to comply with the obligation.</seg>
<seg id="352">The SAO audit found that the financial authorities usually did not use the possibility to save the payers of a fine for failure to meet their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">Especially in the case of SH administration, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations because SH does not affect the tax obligation of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged to comply with § 102 para. 5 Act No 235/2004 Coll. data in SH, or in subsequent SH, verify, any ambiguities to remove and use the data to determine the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of failure of data in SH and data in the relevant (payers with a monthly tax period) or the relevant (payment with a quarterly taxation period) of the VAT tax return, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the tax obligation specified in the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect data in SH tax entity removes the submission of the subsequent SH itself, or it may be invited.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator corrects the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the payer does not prove the data specified in SH (or subsequent SH), while fixing the submission of the subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax administrator has shown that the data given by the payer in SH or subsequent SH are not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator by inserting a repair without submission of the subsequent SH payer does not replace the filing of the tax entity, only adjusts the data in the VIES database so that the current, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from SH is sent to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="362">It may be sent and received only by the national financial administration authority, intended for cooperation with other Member States in the VAT sector; this is CLO (in the Czech Republic fulfils this function of MF, Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automatic message that CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all incorrect VAT ID specified in the sent lines SH.</seg>
<seg id="365">If there is an incorrect VAT ID used in one of the transferred common lines SH or subsequent SH, the record into the table of incorrect VAT ID is executed.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "Announcement of doubts to VAT ID".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator verifies and records the verification result into the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When purchasing goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to admit the VAT and state the values of acquisition on separate lines of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of the acquired goods declared by the Czech payer in his tax return to VAT and the value of the delivered goods as stated by the payers from other Member States in their SH are sent from CLO to the Financial Office for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax administrators are obliged to investigate inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant tax returns of tax returns is lower than the value of the delivery that the EU payers declare.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator will verify the correctness of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The amount of the difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation may be either by changing the data in the EU (foreign supplier will correct their SH) or change the data in the VAT tax return (Czech tax entity itself in the meantime under the additional tax return of the VAT).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether despite this fact it will verify the correctness of the data in the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer stated in the relevant VAT return lines is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared by the payers from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="378">Even here is at the discretion of the administrator whether it will verify the correctness of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After verifying the difference and clarification of the causes of its creation, the tax administrator shall present the verification result to ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the verification are transmitted back to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">Number of cases sent from CLO to the tax authorities for verification for the individual quarter of 2005 displays graph No. 1 (note. source: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">The above-mentioned graph No. 1 demonstrates that the number of cases passed from CLO to the financial authorities decreased in the individual quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant decline in the number occurred during 4. quarter of 2005. CLO increased the minimum financial limit, among others with regard to the possibility of sending applications for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Inconsistency between tax returns data and EU data may not always be caused by an error on the domestic payer's side.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be a mistake on the side of the EU payers or a mistake arising from the fact that some types of transactions may be put into SH in a different way in the individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of reported transactions found on audited financial authorities are given table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of aggregate reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who carry out intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in three-sided transactions are obliged to serve once for a quarter of SH, in which intra-Community delivery is specified according to recipients (§ 18a para. 1 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">SH must be filed until 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the extension of this period is enabled in case of preliminary VAT returns, it is also valid for SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be delivered CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">From 1 January 2007 they must be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exceptions may be permitted by the relevant tax authorities to certain taxpayers to avoid disproportionate hardness.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realise that in SH there are incorrect data, the povini shall submit a correction report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If taxpayers fail to SH, CLO will start driving in order to eradicate the submission of this report.</seg>
<seg id="396">Part of this procedure is: – the first reminder – the second reminder associated with the threat of fines/payment and – penalty measurement.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows you to impose a fine up to EUR 25,000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, in amounts of 125, 250 and 500 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a para. 1 No. 5 UStG determines that the payers act illegally if they deliberately or negligence fail to properly SH, submit them incomplete, they fail in time or if they do not repair or correct late SH at all.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offense may be penalized to EUR 5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community delivery cannot enter the VIES financial office because the processing of SH is the exclusive task of CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data is stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from SH are therefore the financial authority visually available only after their processing on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing SH are set in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Data from SH must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT ID in SH German payers, CLO will receive the O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">CLO contacts a specific entrepreneur and asks for correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If CLO fails to get the right information, the case is handed over to the relevant financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then on these financial offices to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">BRH found out that most VAT ID entrepreneurs have corrected the CLO application at the CLO request.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, threat and measurement of three additional fines occupies in cases where the payer can be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud, too much time.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually announced by the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The Financial Office rejected the liberation of reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked it to hand it on CLO corrected SH, because the tax authorities cannot fix the data in the VIES.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor CLO checked the administration of the corrected SH, so the payers often did not conclude applications.</seg>
<seg id="415">Due to the fact that CLO does not have access to data from VAT returns, the comparison of data on the delivery of goods granted in VAT returns and in SH does not take place before submitting these data CLO other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">The data obtained from other Member States are processed on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">An incorrect VAT ID is selected and subsequently submitted to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">These data are used for the purpose of checking the acquisition carried out by the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, CLO is checked on the basis of comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they comply with certain criteria (see 5.2), check information and sent to the relevant tax authorities are created.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied permanently, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the Financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">RMS installed for the purposes of assessing the assessment subsequently checks these data with data on intra-Community purchases.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, the payers who have made the delivery of goods to another Member State have registered a person registered for tax in another Member State, SH up to 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter of the locally competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="427">The financial authorities process SH and transfer data to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the delivery of goods to another Member State, the payers listed in SH, are compared to the financial authorities with the values of delivery of goods to another Member State referred to by these payers in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The comparison results are used within the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, the payers who carried out intra-Community delivery are obliged to submit a quarterly SH, until the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers served on CLO, from 1. 1. 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">Financial authorities have information from SH available only after processing on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Slices from the Czech Republic and Germany indicate only the delivery of goods in SH, the provision of services is not stated in SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike Czech financial authorities, German tax authorities are unable to correct incorrect lines submitted by SH.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to the German system VIES, the wrong VAT ID was not corrected, although the payer provided the FÚ correct VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German Tax Administration does not use data on intra-Community delivery, which are listed in the VAT tax return of the German payer and its SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">The differences between the data of these two statements are usually not found before the German CLO provides data from the VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Due to the findings of BRH it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of transmitted data in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on the delivery of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">Comparison is done by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most important cases of irregularities are transmitted to tax authorities as a notification of possible errors in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration usually does not control the taxation of intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is processed only for payers who are not entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="444">Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisition of other payers only if RMS produces control alerts or if the payer is intended for checking as well.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Creating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information about intra-Community purchases as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specially VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be shortened by up to four months if the payers are administered by SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly administration would not be an important increase in bureaucratic costs, because most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit tax returns to the tax return – and SH does not require any further information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">The submission of SH may be associated with the administration of a VAT tax return to prevent bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="452">Obligation to submit SH monthly would nevertheless cause more time disagreements between the reporting of intra-Community delivery and intra-Community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between individual CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">The German Federal Government considered general provisions of monthly SH in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="454">His realization failed due to the doubts of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that the monthly submission of data from the VIES to CLO other Member States could lead to misunderstanding and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the obligation of a monthly SH administration and monthly transfer of data should be effective, monthly updates to the VIES system would require a European standard of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical data on delivery and purchase of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">Within the framework of foreign trade, Germany for the Czech Republic represents the most important business partner.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions with goods carried out between the Czech Republic and Germany are given in Table No.2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAI requested data on the number of incorrect VAT ID or VAT ID contained in the reports of O_MCTL passed between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The cause of these differences can be a different basis for determining the number of reports O_MCTL.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO applies their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was filed, the German CLO relates to their numbers for the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was accepted.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Performing international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States regarding intra-Community commercial transactions and payers who made these transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of exchange of information, exchange of information on the request and exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on the application is implemented in the form of applications for information (hereinafter referred to as the “ŽOI”), using standardized SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Czech Republic's tax administrators send their ŽOI, virtually answers to the delivered ŽOI through financial headquarters to CLO, which provides translation of information provided on standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their sending to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">CLO also ensures the income of ŽOI from other Member States and answers to the sent ŽOI, their translation into Czech and distribution of locally competent tax administrators to process.</seg>
<seg id="472">In Art. 8 The Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 is determined by the maximum deadline for the processing of ŽOI for 3 months from receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO audit was subjected to all ŽOI, handed over during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">From a total of 94 ŽOI, adopted in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74,5%) set out in a specified three-month period, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were settled after this period and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany until the SAO was checked.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information about the deadlines in which answers to ŽOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic, contains graph No 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">From the total number of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany was on 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) the answer is delivered within a specified three-month period, another 179 (i.e. 53,4%) of the application was answered after this period and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) were not delivered to the SAO until the SAO's audit was delivered (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the data transmitted when the response from Germany was delivered).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information about the deadlines in which the answers to the Czech Republic were delivered to the Czech Republic contains graph No 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">Percentage expression of intra-community transactions values referred to in ŽOI passed between the Czech Republic and Germany contains graph No 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the aforementioned chart, the value of commercial transactions tested through ŽOI, most often moved in the band over 60,000 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information, or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">The tax administrators from other Member States are often transmitted without prior request, which may be important for them when managing VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The information is transmitted electronically between individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the “Automatic Exchange” shall understand the systematic communication of pre-defined information into other Member States without prior request and in pre-defined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">“The structured automatic exchange” is then understood by the systematic communication of pre-defined information into other Member States without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available for the tax administrator from the report on the delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">The tax administrator fills the necessary data into a specially created template in the processing of the above-mentioned printed matter and handed over it to a contact employee at the financial headquarters, where these data are collected and within the specified date, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter, in which the following information was available, submitted to CLO for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the shipment sale, which is exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EU, which appears to be unauthorized and information about the potential “missing of traders”.</seg>
<seg id="490">The information is sent to other Member States in the form of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, it initiates both applications for information and processing of spontaneous information locally competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="493">Financial authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by email directly to the German CLO, which passes the SCAC forms to foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Financial Office was given to the instruction to write their requests for information or own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of German applications for information controlled by BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisition in another Member State or to prove the liberation of intra-Community delivery from Germany to another Member State from tax.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives an application for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the delivery of goods or the provision of services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable reason for this request, the German CLO rejects any application containing the amount less than this specified limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates free texts of SCAC forms [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or in English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the application for information, CLO sends the application to the relevant tax office by pointing out the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no other deadlines for processing applications for specific organisational levels of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has technical conditions for monitoring the past time periods, it lacks sufficient personnel capacity, which would allow to draw attention to the financial authorities to answer unfilled applications for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">Financial authorities will receive the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by performing an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit, which concerns any taxable process for a period of several months or the so-called VAT inspection, which may concern only one business operation, which was recently performed.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible type of audit does not require any taxpayer notification and demonstrated its benefits in investigating individual taxable business operations.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within the framework of automatic exchange without prior request, SRN provides information to other Member States – VAT ID allocated to payers who are residents in other Member States – a refund of tax on the entry of payers who are residents in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany undertook to provide other Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, b. sending or catalogue sales in other Member States that is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisition declared payer and data from VIES, provided by other Member States, d. intra-community delivery of goods that the German payer did not show in SH, because with delivery treated as domestic transactions, e. potential “missing trader”, which took place intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who delivered the goods to potential “missing traders” or to those recipients who abused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Sending ŽOI or spontaneous information initiates both in the Czech Republic and in Germany locally relevant tax authorities that send the completed SCAC form to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses a bilingual SCAC form (English – English) and the sent information translates into English, or German language, German tax authorities are governed by the instructions according to which they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German for a single-language form.</seg>
<seg id="511">German CLO does not provide the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">By verifying the ŽOI passed in the period from 1. 5. 2004 until 31. 12. 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany found the SAO that the Czech tax administration handled 74,5% of delivered applications in the specified three-month period, while the ŽOI sent to Germany was settled in the German tax administration within 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO warns the financial authorities for a three-month period, the past time period does not follow.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of missing alerts is a large number of delayed answers to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Due to these problems, BRH recommended regular alerts to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information of the German CLO, the financial authorities now draw attention to the answer of unfinished answers to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">Risk management in the VAT sector</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">Several departments on various organisational levels of tax administration are engaged in the management of risks in the field of VAT in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="521">The following departments deal with the issue of risk management and the fight against fraud in the area of VAT:</seg>
<seg id="522">Department of Methodology and Exercise of VAT and the Report of Risk Management in the Field of VAT, which is governed by a selection of risks to possible tax evasion and assesses the trends of these risks to domestic and community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">The nationally coordinates the functioning of the Confidentiality of Tax returns and the use of data from the VIES system in terms of risk of tax evasion within intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the balance sheet of the Czech Republic, the risk commodities, processes conceptually risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this area with relevant EU institutions and other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in Tax Administration, which provides, among other things, the exchange of information in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyzes data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides public awareness and provides other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAI requested data on the number of incorrect VAT ID or VAT ID contained in the reports of O_MCTL passed between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">The cause of these differences can be a different basis for determining the number of reports O_MCTL.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO applies their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was filed, the German CLO relates to their numbers for the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was accepted.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department of Tax Control Methods and Search, which, among other things, performs risk analysis within the methodological management of tax inspections and in accordance with the risk analysis, determines the priorities of the focus of tax inspections in the plans of financial headquarters, processes the analysis of risks within the restriction of tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge obtained during tax administration and other sources and proposes measures to limit tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">The financial directorate is established by the search department, which performs, among other things, the search for tax entities and areas that are risky in terms of the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax entities in terms of risk of tax evasion (e.g. in the field of Internet services, mediation of work, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of chain fraud and transfer information by territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">On selected 12 financial offices, a department of specialized control is established.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence, tax inspections outside the territorial competence of the financial authorities carried out on the basis of credentials.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to establish a department of specialized tax inspections resulted from the increasing findings of new and more perfect forms of tax evasion, which occur mainly in entities connected to chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">This department focuses on the control of tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax entities of a large range of activities in terms of turnover size.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for limiting the risks in the VAT sector were integrated into the ADIS system: – the role of the Confidentiality of Tax returns, serving to evaluate the risk of tax returns, – the role of Selection of Tax entities to control, enabling to withdraw on the basis of the selected criteria of the payer to control – the role of VIES, through which the tax administrators have access to the data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES allows among others: – to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, – to obtain values of goods supplied to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, to generate a lineup of payers who did not submit SH, to make formal data control, which the payers from the Czech Republic stated in SH, before sending these data to other Member States, to generate a lineup of payers where the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States referred to in VAT tax returns do not agree with data in SH – to generate a set of payers where the value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States referred to in VAT tax returns does not agree with the data declared in SH all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of the activities for limiting the risks of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to the registers of state administration bodies such as the Commercial Register, the Land Register, the register of motor vehicles, the register of trade business, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information is given in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of aggregate reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federative (co-finished) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (especially CLO) and tax administration 16 federal states participate in the development and operation of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are common working groups for development, neither CLO nor tax administration of federal states share a completely consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At CLO level, the ST I 2 department collects (hereinafter referred to as the “KUSS” – coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigation) finding control on tax fraud in a special database called OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">The KUSS introduced a new database called ZAUBER intended for the transfer of the names of companies of tax scammers “missing traders” in cooperation with the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of KUSS is projected in RMS development in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, there are specialists in several other CLO and MF departments entrusted with obligations and powers associated with RMS.</seg>
<seg id="549">A formal control of the composition of VAT ID of other Member States in SH filed by German payers is introduced at CLO level.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal control is performed before providing data from SH to other Member States, to improve clarity and use of the data provided VIES (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Verification of VAT validity ID referred to in SH is carried out on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for repairs of invalid VAT ID, see. also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, RMS is based on the VIES system data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually appear in the so-called carousel business operations, in order to detect potential “missing traders”.</seg>
<seg id="553">The financial authorities of the Federal States have the instruction to process these auditing reports and in some cases report on the results of their findings CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">Determination of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics, if it is to be sufficient likely to anticipate the existence of a tax fraud case (place of exclusive focus on the turnover of the company).</seg>
<seg id="555">BRH therefore proposed the MF to take into account different characteristics when processing messages.</seg>
<seg id="556">RMS should also affect other facts such as payment behavior (moral) taxpayer, field (economic activities) or shareholder's structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of RMS is processed in tax joints of federal states and focused on the processing of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">RMS, for example, generates a list of those payers who reported intra-Community delivery in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to CLO to track the full submission SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares the intra-community acquisition reported in the payer's annual tax return, with the VIES system data.</seg>
<seg id="561">Tax administration of federal states tries to avoid comparison of quarterly data, because this comparison would reveal too much disagreement of the data attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">– a different period of implementation of intra-Community transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the recipient on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (pictures) and their different reporting in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to the comparison of data from VAT tax returns and the VIES system, many federal states have introduced elements of RMS based on tax return data and some other facts (such as the structure of the company name, shareholder age, number of employees and payment behaviour/ morality of taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">The Bavaria introduced RMS based on rules that allow the team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules for excluding potential perpetrators of tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied at the moment the tax authorities process monthly tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="567">The competent tax office will therefore receive a recommendation created by RMS before the VAT setting.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this RMS is unable to project current findings into its activities, the risk managers must adjust the relevant rules on the basis of feedback from the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The administrative circuit of Meclenburg-Western Pomerania programmed adaptive artificial neural network with data of tax files in which the control revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, RMS is able to determine the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">RMS creates a list of tax files once a month, where there is suspicion of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for decision-making on the audit of the proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, auditors must report on their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The North Rhine-Vestphalia administrative area uses an adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a fuzzy system based on rules.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a large number of data assessed tax returns and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or system of selecting potentially useful information (so-called data-mining system) calculates the probability that a certain taxpayer has committed a tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">Then compiles a monthly list of potential perpetrators of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="577">Local tax authorities use this list as a basis for the selection of relevant taxpayers to control and report the detection of the centre for data processing.</seg>
<seg id="578">Implementation of one of these three RMS in other federal states further takes place.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since none of these three RMS is based on identical access, it seems to be a useful combination of all systems for solving tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as different approaches in three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU country has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of the EU Member States are currently discussing new tendencies and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – are not proven to be national, but rather European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">The payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in more countries.</seg>
<seg id="587">Effective RMS cannot be developed only by one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components and approaches RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise the deceivers will select a Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not intervene by the Member State of the initiator of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Each Member State, which is included in fraudulent activities, may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">The SAO and BRH examined quality and use of information about selected commercial transactions, which were subject to international exchange of information between tax administrators of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">Furthermore, both audit institutions examined the implementation of several business transactions, where there were doubts about their implementation, virtually inconsistency in the way the payers from both countries reported these business transactions in their tax returns, or SH.</seg>
<seg id="595">The SAO examined a total of 8 cases on the request of BRH, which concerned commercial transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In 43 cases, the SAO examined the value of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH.</seg>
<seg id="597">The BRH examined a total of 23 cases on the request of the SAO, which concerned commercial transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through the official communication with CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">By verifying selected cases, it was found that a different method of registration in EU Member States leads to problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should buy in III. quarter 2004 from German payer of goods worth 60,500 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="602">Since the Czech payer reported the purchase of goods only worth the corresponding 29 869 EUR, the Czech tax administrator sent an application for verification of the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">In response to ŽOI delivered from Germany, the German party stated that in the II. quarter of 2004 added German payer to Czech payer of goods worth 27 381 EUR, in III. quarter of 31 997 EUR and in the IV quarter of 2004 worth 10 276 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="604">The answer also resulted that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28. 9. 2004, but the German CLO in 2006 on the basis of an additional request of the German payer certificate of VAT ID retroactively issued a certificate of validity of VAT ID from 1. 5. 2004. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer carried out the repair of SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, the Czech payer discussed the purchase of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">The SAO found out that the Czech payer on the basis of investigation of the tax administrator filed an additional VAT tax return for individual taxation periods of 2004 in which he increased the value of goods taken from other Member States and also claimed VAT deduction when purchasing goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine from these additional tax returns whether the values of deliveries from the German supplier are also included in them.</seg>
<seg id="609">The BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since the VAT ID has not been allocated when registering, only the identification number for transactions within Germany was assigned.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although in Germany it is usually not possible to allocate VAT payers ID retroactively, allocated the German tax official in 2006 above to the German VAT payer ID retroactively to 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">German CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay caused CLO to the VAT ID payer.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community delivery pursuant to § 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the contrary, the German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of his supplier to show intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these different procedures between Member States, German CLO assigned VAT ID retroactively in this special case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Czech tax administrator asked for the international exchange of information about the verification of the registration of the German VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES stated the date of registration 5. 3. 2005, the date 1. 10. 2004. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In response delivered from Germany, the German party stated that the German tax entity was registered from 1. 10. 2004, but VAT ID was provided in Germany for organizational reasons until 16. 2. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">The SAO found a question with the local tax administrator that the Czech tax administrator carried out VAT for the tax period III. quarter 2004 to II. quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">This control of the financial office found that the Czech payer included the services worth CZK 9 897 (314 EUR), provided to the German payer at the time before its registration for VAT (i.e. before 1. 10. 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax period III. quarter of 2004 the tax entity of the tax entity consulted VAT of CZK 1,880 (60 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="623">BRH found out on the basis of the SAO requirement the German payer was assigned to the VAT ID until 16. 2. 2005, when he informed the financial office about his business which he initiated in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">Furthermore, the tax office registered for VAT retrospective as of 1 October 200415, so that it could monitor the filing of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer reported an intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approximately CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech payer reported in the VAT tax return for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth 114 615 CZK (3 642 EUR) German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">The Czech tax administrator in verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system found that his registration was valid from 11. 11. 2004, i.e. up to the delivery of the goods to the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer filed an additional DAP for VAT in which it reported the basis of the tax on the performance carried out in the Czech Republic worth 114 615 CZK (3 642 EUR) and VAT of 21 777 CZK (692 EUR), which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO found out the question of the local competent tax office in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer subsequently filed an application for the renewal of the management in the case of an additional tax return to the VAT and submitted a confirmation of the German tax administration that the German payer was taxed from 1. 1. 2000. 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer within the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">From the response delivered from Germany, it resulted that the German payer was assigned to the VAT ID until 11. 11. 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator rejected the application for renewal of the management.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods in the given case, because the German payer received VAT ID up to 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient reported the acquisition as an intra-community acquisition and reported VAT from this acquisition when required a tax refund at the entrance in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, because there would be no change in the value of VAT, which the German payer had the obligation to pay, he did not correct the tax administrator in Germany data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH further found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, resulting in a confusion of two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the purchase of goods by Czech payer in I. quarter 2005 worth 22 686 EUR from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">The SAO found out the question with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that this administrator carried out the local investigation with the Czech payer, in which he verified that the delivery of the goods was carried out and the Czech payer charged the invoice for the goods and paid it.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not admit the purchase of goods in the VAT tax return, because the German supplier did not provide its VAT ID, but only tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions from 21. 4. 2005, i.e. up to the delivery of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked German tax administration to send a copy of the registration of a German payer to take steps to tax the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Financial Office assessed the given business transaction as the acquisition of goods from the Germany, and therefore did not measure the Czech payer from the specified business transaction additionally.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that according to German legislation, the payer who supplies goods to other Member States may not have a VAT ID assigned to intra-Community delivery of goods exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The Supplier must only have VAT ID available from another Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act, it was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be measured in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine in the specified value was not the basic subject of the business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to answer ŽOI, which concerns intra-Community transactions worth less than EUR 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to data from the VIES in III. quarter 2004 to buy from the German payer of goods worth 12 561 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out tax control at the tax entity for this taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the international administrative cooperation, the German tax administration requested verifying the delivery of this goods through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denyed the acquisition of goods, claimed that he never traded with the German company and was not charged in his accounting.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration requirement for the provision of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents rejected the reason that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15,000 and no further explanatory justification was stated.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax administrator did not receive funds for the taxation of the acquired goods, he terminated the tax control without finding and tax obligation remained in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">BRH found that the German payer acted as a so-called “fiscal representative” (§ 22 and – e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer reported the following deliveries in his annual VAT return tax return and SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">The claim for exemption of delivery was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the BRH notice, the German Financial Office will send documents necessary for the taxation of acquired goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in Chapter 4.6.1 of response to ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the specified three-month period more often than the answers from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO found out that the Czech tax administration sent on 5. 10. 2005 to Germany Request information regarding the verification of the value of the delivered goods for 4. quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer reported in SH for this period delivery of goods to the Czech payer worth 86 307 EUR, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the tax return to the purchase of goods only worth the corresponding 35 314 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic 9. 5. 2006, i.e. after the deadline for processing, set out in Art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the application could not be settled, because the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">By not keeping the German tax administration for the processing of ŽOI, the Czech tax administration had no documents necessary for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. The Czech tax administrator asked in 2005 through the SCAC form to verify the delivery of cars worth CZK 1,265 554 to the German payer carried out in III. and IV quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that the response was not delivered to the ŽOI until the control was reached from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also found a question with the local tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include the delivery of new means of transport for the German payer worth CZK 11 816 103 (375 472 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity submitted subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">Based on the requirement of the SAO, BRH found that the German CLO for technical reasons did not transfer the above ŽOI locally to the competent tax office to verify.</seg>
<seg id="670">After the BRH alert was carried out in Germany by the German procurement check, during which it was found that the acquisition of all cars was properly taxed and that the respective cars were sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to data from the VIES, the Czech payer should buy a passenger car worth CZK 48,500 in the IV quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">The acquisition of this goods was not admitted by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">The SAO found the question of the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech taxpayer did not submit a VAT return from August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">Tax returns were not filed by the Czech taxpayer even after the challenges of the tax administrator, so the tax office on 23. 5. 2005 assessed the VAT of CZK 0 for October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2. 6. 2005 CLO pointed out the above delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator ŽOI sent to Germany regarding the above delivery.</seg>
<seg id="677">Because the answer to ŽOI was delivered to the Czech Republic until 7. 2. 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO audit, how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by the international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tax office of the Czech payer due to failure to fulfil the obligations arising from the VAT Act cancelled as of 23. 8. 2005 VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to ŽOI, because the inspection carried out by the financial authorities for the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH control:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Czech tax administrator asked in 2005 through the SCAC form to verify the delivery of the car worth 16 991 EUR German payer, carried out in III. quarter 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In response to ŽOI, the German tax administrator said he had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for delivery worth 16 335 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="683">The BRH found that the inspection carried out by the German financial authority at the representative from Germany has not yet been terminated.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German Provider reported the purchase of goods worth 16 335 EUR twice in tax returns for the month of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. The Czech tax administrator asked the German payer worth 198 167 EUR, carried out in the IV quarter of 2004 and I. quarter 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the Czech Republic in the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and stated that the investigation in Germany was not terminated.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that in the Czech supplier the local competent tax office carried out several local investigations in order to verify the drawdown of excessive VAT deductions, in which they did not find out their unauthorized pumping.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer reported the purchase of goods from other Member States in the total value of EUR 579 114 and that the control, carried out by the German Financial Office at the Provider from Germany has not yet been terminated.</seg>
<seg id="690">The chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for differences between the values of intra-Community purchase of goods, which the recipient stated in the tax return and values introduced by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases have shown that the most common reasons for differences were not a time shift or incorrect value of intra-Community delivery of goods in SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">Czech slices had in I. 2005 according to data from the VIES system to buy from the German payer of goods worth 35 716 EUR, but the Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not develop any activity at the company headquarters, the Czech tax administrator asked for the international exchange of information to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="695">From the response to ŽOI delivered from Germany, it resulted that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity is unknown to the addressed address and that the goods took over the agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was EUR 155 000, but the German payer delivered the goods only worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent a false confirmation of the payment of EUR 155 153 for the benefit of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After finding a fraudulent conduct by the Czech provider, the German payer with the help of his other Czech customers managed to obtain the delivered material back, except for one item worth 7 916 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO has found a question with the local tax office in the Czech Republic from the tax administrator, among other things, to the Czech VAT payer from the purchase of goods from other Member States in the amount of 388 522 CZK (13 044 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="700">BRH confirmed on the basis of the SAO requirement that the German supplier reported after repairs of the delivery of goods to the Czech payer only worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected values of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter in which it was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="702">The more of its SH contained the following values of delivery in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested to verify the delivery of goods and the provision of services carried out in III. quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer had to deliver the German payer of goods in the total value of CZK 396 126 in this period and provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out the local investigation for the purpose of verifying this delivery with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer added a production line to the German payer, including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">The individual parts of the production line of the Czech payer added before the Czech Republic to the EU and after 1. 5. 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the line, because he claimed that he had defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In III. quarter 2005 Czech payer issued a German payer invoice for CZK 107 100 per assembly and 11 885 EUR for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer issued the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO further in a question with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic found that all invoices are properly registered in the accounting of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="713">Tax returns in VAT for III. The quarters of 2005 are given only the amounts that were documented by the Czech payer and which relate to invoicing after 1. 5. 2004. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that on the basis of the response from the Czech tax administration, the local competent tax office in Germany concluded that in the case of a transaction, the delivery of goods from the Czech payer was a German payer, including services for assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this special case, there is a place of so-called performance of the work where the production line occurred.</seg>
<seg id="716">According to the German VAT Act, the German recipient delivered the service is obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may apply VAT deduction from the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">Since there would be no changes in the VAT value, which the German payer had the obligation to pay, repairs in the VAT tax return were neglected by the German Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to data from the VIES in February 2005, the Czech payer A had a machine worth CZK 58,000 in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent an application for the verification of this delivery to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to ŽOI, the German party stated that this machine was already in 2004 by the German payer C added to the Czech payer B, which, however, had to return this machine to the German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, from the response to the application for information showed that the German payer C the machine in February 2005 sold the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="724">This sliced machine took over the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic at the headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="725">Because the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO found out in a question with the tax administrator the locally competent payer B that according to the data VIES the German payer C added in III. quarter 2004 Czech payer B goods (other machine) worth 88 027 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="727">The payer B denied this purchase of goods, so the locally competent tax administrator sent ŽOI to Germany to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to this application, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">Another investigation on the payer B found the Czech tax administrator that the machine worth 88 027 EUR was not found in the accounting of the payer B, and that it could be a machine of the same type as the organizational component of the German payer C was delivered to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator locally competent payers A carried out a local investigation with this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had an invoice of German payer C from 7. 2. 2005, on which he was as a customer of the machine given the payer A.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that the payer A does not have this invoice included in accounting.</seg>
<seg id="733">The payer And he had with another Czech company a closed leasing contract, where the subject of leasing was the machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The handover of the machine from the leasing company occurred 9. 2. 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the response to the application for information of the Czech financial office did not use to determine the tax obligation for the payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C machine worth 88 027 EUR did not bring to the Czech Republic, but another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was not about intra-Community delivery of goods, but about taxable performance in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not acknowledge the German payer C liberation from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D added the machine to the Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the German legislation, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but VAT was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C stated in his SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of the machine worth CZK 58,000 to the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not verified during the tax inspection carried out by the German financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following scheme displays relations between the participants of the above business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO found out that the Czech tax administration adopted the Czech tax administration on 4. 10. 2005 from Germany Request information in which the German tax administrator asked for verification of intra-Community delivery from the German payer worth 879 680 625 EUR to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that in this case it was a pretended intra-Community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">In ŽOI it was also said that the German payer from 1999 did not take any active business activity.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the statement of the Managing Director of the Czech Society, in the above case it was probably a receivable of the German payer against the German tax administration applied by the Czech payer as a companion of the German company at the German Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator has no information about the fact that the German tax administration, related to the Czech payer, solves.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to available information, it was not the delivery of goods, yet the value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-community delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the recipients did not show intra-Community purchases of goods in their tax returns (see chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to data from the VIES, the German payer added in III. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 Czech payer of goods in total value 33 205 EUR. The Czech payer did not confess this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator asked in the international exchange of information about the verification of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">The German tax administration stated in response to this request that the German payer of part of the goods sent to the address of the Czech payer, the other goods were picked up personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the question of the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that before receipt of the response to ŽOI, the Czech payer under the aforementioned period of additional VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended the tax control with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The check has not been carried out so far.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. The German payer added according to data in the VIES in III. quarter 2004 to Czech payer of goods worth 46 854 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="761">The Czech payer for the same period admitted intra-Community acquisition only in the amount corresponding to the amount of CZK 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator asked for verification within the international exchange of information the value of the delivery carried out.</seg>
<seg id="763">To answer the ŽOI, delivered from Germany, 3 invoices with the total value of the delivery of goods 31 999 EUR were included, i.e. value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="764">The SAO found out in a question with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that after receiving the response from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accounting Czech payer and agreed that after the verification of these invoices with the owner of the company discusses the administration of an additional tax return for III. quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">Additional tax returns have not yet been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would continue to proceed to comply with the deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">The German payer was supposed to deliver the Czech payer of the goods worth CZK 11 600 in the IV quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="769">The German tax administrator asked for the international exchange of information about the confirmation, whether the Czech payer really existed because the alleged companion of the German payer was founded in Germany by more fictitious companies.</seg>
<seg id="770">When examining the business transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the statement of the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and was further sold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted documents for the sale of goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer, the tax on the sale of the goods in the Czech Republic did not even admit in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts suggested tax evasion in Germany and the Czech tax administrator told the German tax administration in response to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">The SAO found a question with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer under the investigation submitted an additional tax return for the IV quarter of 2004, which included the value of the acquisition of goods, among other things, from the German payer and also claimed the deduction of tax on the purchase of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT from the sale of goods in Germany did not lead to the Czech tax return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional tax return of VAT after the local investigation without change.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, it was not the acquisition of goods from other Member States, because the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator therefore carried out an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax administrator immediately after accepting the response to ŽOI, in which it was stated that the goods did not leave Germany, corrected the tax return of the German payer and demanded VAT in the amount of EUR 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">Moreover, the competent tax office sent a notification to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the next sale of this goods will be taxed correctly.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, the payers reported intra-Community transactions to which they probably did not actually occur:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received the application for information from the German tax administration whether the Czech payer acquired a passenger car worth CZK 47 400 in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">Annex to the application was a copy of the registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="786">Furthermore, a copy of the passport of the person who had, as was said, was also attached to the transport of the car.</seg>
<seg id="787">The investigation of the Czech tax administrator found that it was a stolen passport, a person in it a vehicle in the Czech Republic did not carry out and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">Certificate of VAT registration, whose copy sent the German party, the Czech tax administrator never issued.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was introduced by the Czech tax administrator to the answer to ŽOI together with the message that it cannot confirm the purchase of goods – the car.</seg>
<seg id="790">The SAO found out the question at the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer did not meet the Czech payer at the address specified in the Commercial Register and the Managing Director was non-contact.</seg>
<seg id="791">The Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer in the amount of CZK 0 for the tax period of February 2005 for the tax period of February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="792">Another investigation of the Czech tax administrator found that the car was sold to another Czech entity who bought it through the advertisement on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that locally competent German tax administrator on the basis of a Czech response to ŽOI does not recognize the German payer entitled to deliver this delivery from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the audit, the German Financial Office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3,000 between the value of the acquired goods reported in the tax return of the payer and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was communicated that the Czech payer had to deliver during the IV Q4 to I. quarter 2005 German payer of goods worth 89 424 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in the VIES, the German tax administrator asked to verify the deliveries and their payment within the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax administrator in response to ŽOI stated that the only executive of the Czech company was erased from the Commercial Register on 8. 7. 2005 and the new Managing Director was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was apparently a relative of the Czech society.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed a tax return to the VAT and SH, which signed an unauthorized person after deleting the Managing Director from the Commercial Register – a member of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accounting Czech taxpayer confirmed that the company's companion paid for the invoiced goods in EUR inserted into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">The cashier documents were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO found in the Czech Republic a question with the local tax office that the tax administrator acknowledged the Czech payer for the IV quarter of 2004 entitled to exemption from VAT for the delivery of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326 307 (42 145) and for the I. quarter 2005 of 1 416 180 CZK (47 548 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the tax return of the German provider, because the German judge confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the earlier check did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to eradicate the measured tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to data in the VIES, the German payer acquired the goods worth 4 251 196 EUR after the goods worth EUR 43 274 took place in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">German payer of intra-Community acquisition did not show in the tax return for 2004 even in the tax return for 2005.</seg>
<seg id="807">Furthermore, it did not show adequate delivery.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these differences, the German Financial Office of ŽOI sent on 4. 2005 and 1. quarter 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported in SH for these two quarters intra-Community delivery of goods to the German payer in the total value of 167 246 083 CZK (5 615 299 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6. 9. 2006 the ŽOI was delivered, in which the German party asked to examine whether the Czech payer reported intra-Community delivery was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this ŽOI Czech tax administration stated that the requirement of the German party was not possible to meet because the Czech payer had no executive.</seg>
<seg id="812">As follows from the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax administrator, on 30. 3. 2006 was written with the director of the Czech payer a protocol on the commencement of VAT control for the IV quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The taxpayer was also asked to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above period, but he did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">The only executive of the Czech payer disappeared according to the Commercial Register function as of 16. 5. 2006, the new Managing Director was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech payer has ceased to submit a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="816">Within the framework of the SAO control in cooperation with BRH, among other things, several cases of intra-Community delivery, carried out between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not subject to previous exchange of information between tax administrators of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The information about the verified cases was handed over to both the highest audit institutions through CLO both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. The Czech Society (eCR) which is not a resident in Germany informed the relevant tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that he intends to carry out taxable performance in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Due to this information, the company was registered since June 2005, but did not receive the German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) received an order from the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to produce several wind power plants and to deliver these wind power plants on behalf, at risk and to the Danish customer account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to lack of its own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following scheme shows contractual relationships and the way of transporting wind power plants:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of realization of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind power plants to assembly under his name, at his risk and his account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the installation of this delivery took place in Austria, the delivery of wind power plants is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the carrier was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started – in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although wind power plants were sent to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain exemption from tax, because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the Czech company's registered office.</seg>
<seg id="828">This delivery is therefore properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) read the tax on entry in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also intended for the beginning of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind power plants was initiated in the Czech Republic and other in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The supply of those wind power plants that are made in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The supply of other wind power plants that are made in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) carried out both intra-community delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not show any intra-Community acquisition or did not submit SH to the German CLO in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-Community delivery uniformly as intra-community delivery from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (eCR) did not show any intra-Community delivery to Austria, but intra-community delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">To verify the taxation of intra-Community acquisition in Austria would require cooperation of at least four tax administrators (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case does not show any sign of tax fraud or leakage.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the SAO and BRH examined transactions to point out the differences between reporting in the tax return and data from the VIES system, which were caused by a different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in the legal regulation need time for the application of new legislation into practice by slicers and financial authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In SH for II. up to IV. quarter 2004 reported the Czech payer of intra-Community delivery to the German payer in the total value of 792 977 452 CZK (25 197 885 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="841">In the same period, another Czech payer in SH intra-Community delivery reported another German payer in the total value of 18 157 265 CZK (576 970 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, in both cases it was the delivery of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers stated the above delivery in SH in accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">Another verification of the aforementioned transactions by a group of controlling the SAO found that in 2004 there were differences in the legal regulation of delivery, virtually acquisition of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">235/2004 Coll. as an intra-community delivery of goods, in terms of German legal regulation valid in 2004 it was not an intra-Community acquisition, but a taxable performance with a place of performance on the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1. 1. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining selected intra-community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was further found that the Czech payer reported in SH for 1st to 4. quarter 2005 intra-community delivery of the German payer in the total value of 240 411 163 CZK (8 071 823 EUR) and other Czech payer reported in SH for the same period intra-Community delivery to the German payer in the total value of 263 470 776 CZK (8 846 050 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, in both cases it was the delivery of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1. 1. 2005 is in case of supplying electricity instead of fulfilling the place where the buyer has a seat, place of business or where the establishment is delivered for which this goods is delivered.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers did not have the delivery of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">By reported intra-Community supply of electricity in SH, the data was distorted in VIES by 503 881 939 CZK (16 917 873 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">Cooperation fulfilled the objectives of BRH and NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAI gained a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">Cooperation revealed the differences of both systems and showed that the legal regulation in the field of VAT administration differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">During parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were found.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to subsequently examine.</seg>
<seg id="858">Based on the audit findings, both SAI recommendations were created regarding VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of the subsequent control.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both control institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT management controls.</seg>
<seg id="861">Communications</seg>
<seg id="862">The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and President Bundesrechnungshofu, Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>

<seg id="100">3. Preparation and course of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO-ČR and representatives of the SAO SR, on which a specific procedure of cooperation was discussed in the implementation of parallel inspections in the field of excise duty, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">Both parties acquainted with each other with the legal regulation in the field of consumer taxes and the organization of consumer tax administration in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia during the authorisation, or during the opening and termination of the transport of products subject to consumer tax in the regime of conditional exemption from tax and exchange of information between consumer tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="104">The meeting has agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties: - process total data on the amount of products subject to excise duty transported from the Czech Republic to Slovakia and vice versa, whose transport was initiated in the audited period - compare data on the transport of mineral oils - the code combined nomenclature 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - the code combined nomenclature 2207 and 2208 in conditional liberation mode from the tax initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia and vice versa in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>

<seg id="106">In tables 1 and No. 2 the total amount of products subject to excise duty, which were transported in conditional liberation mode from tax between Czech and Slovak tax entities in the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of records of transport goods in conditional liberation mode from tax</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO handed over the transport database to the Slovak side of the database terminated in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5 738 items concerned mineral oils, 134 liabilities and 4 tobacco items.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO of SR handed over the database to the Czech side of the database terminated in Slovakia, which contained a total of 3 319 items listed on the parade documents, of which 696 items concerned mineral oil, 2 066 of the alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO compared data on the transport specified in the register of commenced transport in the Czech Republic with data on terminated transport registered in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are given in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">The data on transport in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of Slovak customs administration, which the SAO handed over to him at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data to reliably agree individual transport, and therefore only 63% of the initiated transport succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transport was assigned according to more data, e.g. sender, recipient, date of transport, amount of transported products.</seg>
<seg id="115">The data on transport initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia in the months of October and November 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to the accompanying documents on the basis of which they managed to clearly assign 93% of the initiated transport.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in litres or in tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">In most cases, the amount of alcohol was stated in litres, which could be recalculated on the litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of the above percentage content of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">The amount of tobacco products was specified in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">The transport started in the Czech Republic, whose termination in the Slovak database failed to reliably verify or in which the data on the transported amount of products did not match, was checked by accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="120">The auditing operation was subjected to accompanying documents for 487 liabilities, mineral oils and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="121">The audit of these documents was carried out on the customs authorities on which the SAO carried out control.</seg>
<seg id="122">The transport documents were required for the transport permitted by other customs authorities through the GŘC.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech party asked the Slovak party to verify the implementation of 141 transport, which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not allow confirmed execution No. 3 parade document, or disagreed the amount of products listed on the accompanying document with a number of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">Furthermore, the Slovak side was handed over to data on the transport recorded in the Slovak database, which, however, the database of the transport of the Czech customs administration did not contain.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO of SR was supervised in the database of Slovak customs administration 95 transport.</seg>
<seg id="126">The verification of the remaining 46 transport requested locally the relevant customs authorities, which have shown their termination by copies of accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak Party advanced a copy of the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport was identified even in the Czech database, except for the transport implemented by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database.</seg>
<seg id="128">The audit of these cases was found:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 transport of the alcohol in the total amount of 276.7 liters of alcohol implemented by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transport of the alcohol in the total amount of 404,66 litres of alcohol implemented in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO found that it was a transport of taxed products to which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">He informed the sender of the tax administrator in writing about the start of the transport. The transport carried out on the basis of accompanying documents, which are used for transport of products in the condition of conditional exemption from tax;</seg>
<seg id="132">- 94 transport of mineral oils, the code combined nomenclature 2710 11 21, in the total volume of 173 thousand litres carried out by the Czech tax entity during September 2004 to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">NKÚ-ČR found that in the period of May 2004 to June 2005 a tax entity carried out transport of 102 thousand litres of untaxed mineral oils without proper authorization.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax entity was the holder of a special permit to receive and use the products exempt from tax on which the untaxed products could only be delivered to the holder of the same permit.</seg>
<seg id="135">The commencement of the transport customs office in the Czech Republic did not recognize and did not provide taxation of CZK 1,207 680 on the transported products.</seg>
<seg id="136">In July 2005 to December 2005 the tax entity transported 71 thousand litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of Slovakia. Even in these cases, he did not meet the legal obligation by not recognizing the launch of the transport customs office.</seg>
<seg id="137">Transport of products referred to in the free tax circulation on the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may start the sender in the Czech Republic without the consent of the customs office, but is obliged to notify the customs office in writing before the transport starts.</seg>
<seg id="138">The tax entity removes the products listed in the free tax circulation in another Member State is obliged to report the amount and ensure tax before their removal.</seg>
<seg id="139">The products can only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, whose requirements regulate Regulation No. 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also admits the use of a accompanying document for transport in conditional liberation mode from tax on which it must be clearly indicated that it is a “simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax inspection (products subject to consumer tax)”.</seg>
<seg id="141">The same legal regulation of transport and acceptance of products listed in the free tax circulation in another Member State also applies in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="142">In these cases, tax entities transported products listed in the free tax circulation with a accompanying document for transport in conditional liberation mode from tax whose 3rd and 4th preparation of the recipient submitted the tax administrator in Slovakia to verify.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in Slovakia registered these transport to the database of the transport in the condition of conditional exemption from tax, as it was not stated on accompanying documents that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO of SR compared the database of transport of Czech customs administration with the database of transport Slovak customs administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in databases the amount of transported products was given unnotically, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, hectoliters or kilograms; the hatch was given in litres or litres of alcohol, which was difficult to compare the transported amount of goods,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the amount of transported alcohol specified in invoices did not match the amount registered in databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- all related invoices were not listed in databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- two transport of liabilities from the Czech Republic to Slovakia implemented in November 2004 in the total volume of 47 237 litres of alcohol, which did not occur in the database of Czech customs administration, were registered in the Slovak customs administration database.</seg>

<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="151">The conditions of cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States competent for the management of excise duty adjusted by 30 June 2005 Council Directive 77/799/EEC, mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the area of direct taxes, some excise duty and insurance tax.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005 Regulation No. 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down the rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for proper assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State determines the central contact body that ensures contacts with other Member States in the field of consumer tax management and is responsible for exchange of information on the movement of goods subject to consumer tax.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, the report “Excise Liaison Office” (hereinafter referred to as the “ELO ČR”) was established for securing the exchange of information in the field of excise duty between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">Security of tasks related to the management of systems to control the movement of goods subject to consumer tax (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and exchange of information within the mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the Slovakia performed with effect from 1 May 2004 the ELO office at the Customs Office Poprad.</seg>
<seg id="156">Effective 1 July 2005 the tasks of the ELO office fulfil the ELO department (with its registered office in Poprad) of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “ELO SR”).</seg>
<seg id="157">Depending on Article 3(1)(s) 3 Regulation No. 2073/2004 central contact authority is responsible especially for the exchange of data maintained in the electronic register SEED, - the timely warning system “Early Warning System Excise” (hereinafter referred to as “EWSE”), - requests for verifying the movement of goods subject to consumer tax sent to other Member States or received by the “Movement Verification System” (hereinafter referred to as “MVS”).</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and function of SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are modified in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No. 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - system for exchange of information on tax entities trading goods subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system consists of national registers of consumer tax payers and enables tax administrators in the European Union to find out if the person is traded by a person authorized with the products subject to consumer tax.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register is made available to the competent authorities of other Member States only for the purposes of consumer taxes.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central contact body of each Member State ensures that persons involved in the movement of goods subject to excise duty on the territory of the European Union may obtain confirmation of information stored in this database.</seg>
<seg id="163">98/2004 Z. z., with § 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Z. z., with § 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Z. z., with § 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Z. z. and with § 39 of Act No.107/2004 Z. z. ELO SR leads an electronic database containing registry of tax warehouse operators, authorized recipients and tax warehouses - the database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs authorities in Slovakia contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, the operator of the tax warehouse or the authorized recipient to the application software SysNed, which is automatically connected to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator is registered in the SysNed database, a legitimate recipient or a tax warehouse, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO of SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the customs administration of the SR and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally more times a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Customs Administration of SR adopted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">The data in the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from the national register in which all persons authorized to handle the products subject to consumer tax and issued permissions to handle these products.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs authorities in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="170">Applications of customs authorities about the provision of information from the SEED database of other Member States are obtained only through the ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system focused on the control of transport of goods subject to excise duty, which is announced by the transport of risk shipments.</seg>
<seg id="172">It is considered a risk shipment to be the transport of certain products subject to consumer tax in quantities exceeding the limits set out in the Regulation of the European Commission, and both the transport as a risk assessment of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is implemented in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - is sent when the specified limits exceed,</seg>
<seg id="175">- warning report - it is sent if the transport of goods is evaluated as risky.</seg>
<seg id="176">When evaluating the level of risk of the shipment ELO SR, the SEED database is used to send a warning report on the basis of which it controls the data specified in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the data with data in the accompanying document (for example disagrees the registration number of the recipient of the goods or the seat of the recipient), ELO SR elaborates a warning message, which will send the ELO of the Member State of the recipient of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">The ELO is governed by the Regulation of the Commission on Tax and Customs Area CED 317 and CED 457, which, among other things, determines the species and quantity of goods in the relevant specific units for elaboration of informative and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the audited period ELO SR sent the ELO CR one warning message.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on commenced transport of products in the amount exceeding the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the process document into the database when approving the transport.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax administrator assesses in the Czech Republic on the basis of his own analysis of the shipment as a risk, he processes the so-called warning report, which he sends to the relevant Member State through the ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005 ELO ČR sent the ELO SR two warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="183">MVS - the system of motion control of goods - allows for applications of MVS to control individual transport of products subject to excise duty and control of the specified route of transport between entities specified in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information takes place on the basis of an application in which the ELO sending the country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system is used mainly in cases where the sender takes over the confirmed execution no. 3 parade document and requires e.g. the refund of the excise duty, and in cases where the data specified in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period ELO SR sent ELO ČR 33 applications MVS.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO ČR sent ELO SR 25 applications MVS.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often examined the data referred to in the accompanying documents, in particular the amount of received, or sent products or whether the sender of the products referred to in the accompanying document is entitled to handle the products subject to excise duty if this fact cannot be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="189">The received applications of MVS were assigned to the customs authorities locally competent for the recipient or sender of the products subject to excise duty in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="190">Customs authorities examined the required data and the result of the investigation announced through the ELO second Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the SAO and the SAO SR allowed to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duty in both countries, the procedure of customs bodies of the Czech Republic and Slovakia during the start and termination of the transport of products in the regime of conditional exemption from tax between the two states, the registration of these transport and further comparison of the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 By comparing legislation governing the area of excise duty in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrators in the opening of the transport of products in the regime of conditional exemption from tax.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of the products in the condition of conditional exemption from tax may only be initiated by the tax entity in the Czech Republic with the consent of the tax administrator who will allow the start of transport under the conditions that the transported products have been provided tax of the tax amount attributed to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The authorisation of the tax administrator is not subject to the commencement of the transport of products in the conditional exemption regime from Slovakia in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="197">In the audited period, the tax entity was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the commencement of transport of liabilities and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">Transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could start without informed the tax administrator about this fact.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, the amendment to all excise tax laws was gradually adopted in Slovakia, according to which the sender of the goods in the condition of conditional exemption from the tax is obliged to send a copy of 1 parade document electronically or by fax to the customs office, which is locally relevant to the sender;</seg>
<seg id="200">b) within the deadlines for sending no 3 parade document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send the execution no. 3 and 4 accompanying document to the verification administrator at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="202">The verified execution No. 3 is obliged to send the sender the following working day after receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The recipient in Slovakia is obliged to send the goods to the sender of the product no. 3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the recipient of the products no later than 15th day of the month following the month in which the goods accepted.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic lead electronic records of transport of products in the regime of conditional exemption from tax.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of conducting this registration is not modified in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia by legal regulation.</seg>
<seg id="206">The customs authorities in both countries enter all data from the accompanying documents in the register, on the basis of which the transport is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no uniform electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods in conditional exemption from tax between the European Union Member States, which would allow the administrators of consumer tax in individual Member States to obtain information about the transport of goods in real time.</seg>
<seg id="208">According to the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council of 1152/2003/EC of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of products subject to excise duty is expected from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">Based on a contract on cooperation in the control activities, the Czech party handed over the database of transport of products in the condition of conditional exemption from tax initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side handed over the database of transport of the goods to the Czech side in the regime of conditional liberation from the tax initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3 319 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared data on the transport specified in the register of commenced transport in the Czech Republic with the registration of the transport terminated in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak party compared data on the transport of goods in the regime of conditional exemption from the tax initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">Comparison of data was made difficult by the fact that the amount of transported goods was not uniformly stated in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly assign data on individual transportes in both records, the accompanying documents and breach of the regime of conditional exemption from tax or tax evasion were not found.</seg>
<seg id="217">Based on knowledge from parallel audits, it can be stated that Member States may obtain valuable information from the registration of the transport to improve the management of consumer taxes.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for transport and control of goods subject to excise duty in the sense of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 1152/2003/EC will enable electronic transfer of accompanying document and more effective control of movement in conditional liberation mode from tax on the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of subsequent control</seg>
<seg id="3">Úvodní slovo</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes generally represent a key source of public income.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is therefore obvious that the highest audit institutions (Supreme Audit Institutions, as well as the “SAI”) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">An example is the value added fraud (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT”).</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss in the amount of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”).</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005 the participants of the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Within this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonized within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “NKÚ”) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, as well as the “BRH”) carried out the first parallel control event in the area of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since fraudulent conduct concerning VAT does not restrict to a single country, but it is extended throughout the EU, close cooperation between the SAI is necessary to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both SAI decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out subsequent parallel control.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject control: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral Audit with SAO (following check)</seg>
<seg id="18">Goal of control:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation was to examine the procedure of financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure in solving selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as “Germany”), and to examine the procedures of tax administrators of both countries within international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The auditing operation was proposed to evaluate the measures taken by tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control finding was intended for comparison with the proven practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period was 2006 to 2008, in the case of factual contexts and the period of the previous and the following, until the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control events</seg>
<seg id="25">Subsequent control of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAI.</seg>
<seg id="26">During previous parallel controls, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them have requested another verification.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of control findings, both SAI recommendations were formulated on VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">The subsequent control action served to evaluate the measures taken in response to this recommendation and to verify selected suspicious cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The auditing operation also focused on selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in debt recovery and inspections of VAT inspections for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">During control of VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, auditors came to the following control findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendation from previous control</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions of registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">Differences were found in previous parallel inspections by comparing VAT registration systems in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since different ways of registration have problems, both SAI has recommended to harmonize the conditions of registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation was submitted at the EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as the “ Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003”) required the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="38">He also modified common standards for registration and registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="39">SAI expected EU Member States to agree on corresponding standards that will support their decisions as quickly as possible to exclude unreliable traders from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of the document agreed on the EU Member States within the ECOFIN does not contain the aforementioned issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAI with regret states that from the idea of common minimum standards was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, this intention is still considered relevant to prevent the fight against fraudulent conduct in the VAT sector.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="44">Within the framework of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submission of aggregate reports and thus allow timely verification of intra-community transactions values.</seg>
<seg id="45">Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax evasion associated with the fulfilment inside the Community, shortens the period for which aggregate reports on the performance within the EU are submitted, for one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act effective from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, it was not obliged to submit aggregate reports a month introduced within the specified period in accordance with applicable EU regulations, while yes in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports in Germany in order to achieve higher reliability of data in the VIES system and consider the interconnection of both systems for VAT returns and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendation and established a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">The work is still underway and BRH will monitor further development in detail.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, folders and approaches of risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control event, both SAI agreed that the effective risk management system cannot be developed only by one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is necessary to exchange successful criteria, components and approaches of risk management system and implement them in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If not, the perpetrators of fraudulent activity will choose a Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their advantages and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO conducted control of EUROCANET, which enables exchange of information within the EU, while BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Subsequent control of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous auditing operation, business transactions were examined together, where there were doubts about their implementation or inconsistencies in reporting commercial transactions in tax returns or aggregate reports of taxpayer from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAI chose for subsequent control of nine cases, which included intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits carried out by the tax authorities of the relevant countries were not closed to the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent auditing operation verified that most tax proceedings in connection with the selected cases of commercial transactions between the payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were concluded and that the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany was adopted adequate measures (e.g. an additional taxation of VAT or preventing tax refund on the entry).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Checking selected cases of risk intraCommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-Community transactions carried out by the EU payers, which were included in the EUROCANET system, were selected to control.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detection of risk payers in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The participation of Member States on this system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">For the active participant of the system, it is unsatisfactory if some Member States reject the active participation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information about who suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the framework of the auditing operation, the SAO found out how cases of common commercial transactions and cases with suspicion of involvement in carousel trades or fraudulent conduct concerning VAT.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrators have limited control options of risk transactions, especially when it comes to the so-called missing traders, with mere physical examination of documents only difficult to prove the tax entity any fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation for the tax administrator occurs if imports and exports are connected to third countries with intra-Community carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be advisable to ensure greater mutual cooperation of customs and financial bodies in order to identify goods and inconsistencies in the transport documentation and also monitor its physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, as well as some other countries, hesitates with active involvement in the EUROCANET system due to the absence of sufficient legal base.</seg>
<seg id="73">Other tools are used in Germany to detect the risk payers of taxpayers, which have proven to have proven to be the German tax administration so far.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, it is necessary to communicate and exchange experience between EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council achieved political conformity on the draft regulation, which amends Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">His main innovation consists in creating EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far during the use of the EUROCANET system should be the basis for creating this new VAT fraud fight.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="79">In the field of international assistance in debt recovery, all EU Member States govern the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH carried out a comparison of statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission in 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAI considers useful statistics to discuss again at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persisting discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without that, statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, SAI tries to believe that reliable statistics should contain more VAT information.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful if the Commission processed an analysis based on more detailed statistics, which would help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight with VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the opinion of both SAI, it means assistance for Member States with a low rate of success of enforcement, so that the degree of enforcement of receivables can increase at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If any Member State wish, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Checking large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">SAI analysed the legal situation concerning VAT control in large tax entities (hereinafter referred to as the “VDS”) in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they gathered information in the form of a questionnaire from tax administrators about areas that the SAI considers essential to manage this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The received answers clearly show that the situation in both countries develops differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system that relies on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from the tax inspections carried out, balance sheet data and profits and losses, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2012, the establishment of a specialized financial office for the management of the VDS.</seg>
<seg id="96">In Germany, a similar system does not exist yet, which makes it difficult to control and analyze VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far been concentrating more on the selection of individual cases, especially on the basis of data from tax returns and aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of this data is based on different risk management components that will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Progress of the audit action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 The course of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The auditing operation was carried out from May 2009 to February 2010 by the Department II. - separation of the state budget income and territorial departments IX. Pilsen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “Czech Ministry of Finance”) and 25 financial offices (hereinafter referred to as “FÚ”): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ in Břeclav, FÚ in Domažlice, FÚ in Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ in Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava III, FÚ in Písek, FÚ in Pilsen, FÚ for Prague 1, FÚ for Prague 4, FÚ for Prague 8, FÚ in Rakovník, FÚ in Sokolov, FÚ in Tábor, FÚ in Vysoké Mýto, FÚ in Zlín and FÚ in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The auditing conclusion from this auditing operation approved the Colleague of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 The course of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out in the period from February 2009 to February 2010 by the control department for indirect taxes and staff intended for regional control authorities in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the sample of cases, a number of federal states were notified of the mission of the control action.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to interviews at the Bund Ministry of Finance, the auditing operation took place in these federal states: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Vestphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax writings of the following financial offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-sever), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, negotiations with the financial authorities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and financial Directorates in Frankfurt, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The report on the audit found was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation of both control institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In the preparation of parallel control events, a meeting of representatives of both control institutions took place in September 2008 for discussion and determination of the topic of control.</seg>
<seg id="113">Then in December 2008 the highest representatives of both SAI signed an agreement on cooperation in the implementation of parallel inspections.</seg>
<seg id="114">At the meeting in Bonn in June 2009 the control teams informed each other about the initial results achieved during the preparation of control, discussed possible auditing approaches and agreed together another procedure.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague from 2. - 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The auditing teams exchanged together until then collected findings and agreed together a schedule for compiling a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAI decided to focus on: • subsequent control of the implementation of recommendations made in the previous report, • verification of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not resolved during the previous parallel control, • verification of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were classified as cases with a high risk, • control of the procedure of tax administrators in the field of international assistance in debt recovery, • tax control of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of parallel control events was prepared during the working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Control of VAT management in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous control</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions of registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous auditing operation, the SAO recommended adjustments to the VAT registration conditions and the introduction of a new rule for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Adjusted conditions should allow to effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion in the VAT selection.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that the tax authorities did not use the authorization to cancel the registration for VAT to payers who did not meet the obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”).</seg>
<seg id="127">The amendment to the provisions consisting in the introduction of the obligation of tax administrators to cancel VAT payers is not undergoing the Czech Ministry of Finance at repeated non-submission of the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the taxpayer “ex offo” in cases where: a) the payer did not take the reason for the tax administrator for twelve consecutive months, b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations arising from this Act, c) the payer ceases to be a mandatory tax.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous control event, it was found that the valid legal regulation enabled the FÚ for Prague 1 to cancel VAT registration as of 31 January of the following calendar year so-called unsettled payers, which did not arise during the normal calendar year, no obligation to admit and pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FÚ did not cancel the VAT for Prague 1 often to these payers, because the relevant provisions set out for the cancellation of the registration an insufficient period.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was removed by the amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the unsettled taxpayer if the taxpayer did not carry out any goods or services in the previous calendar year subject to tax or goods or services exempt from tax with a claim for VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="135">Within the framework of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council's Directive shortens the period for which aggregate reports on the performance within the EU are submitted, for one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The obligation to submit a summary report in electronic form is also newly established.</seg>
<seg id="138">The summary report must be submitted to the payers even if the services for which the place of fulfilment is determined pursuant to § 9 para. 1 of the VAT Act, provided to another Member State of a person registered for tax in another Member State and if it is obliged to admit and pay their recipient tax from these services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC, in terms of the place of provision of the service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports in order to achieve higher reliability of data in the VIES system This recommendation concerned German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration performs the comparison of data on intra-Community transactions listed in VAT tax returns and aggregate reports of Czech payers automatically in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful criteria, ingredients and approaches of risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper selection of VAT is one of the necessary prerequisites for the correct functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Therefore, the fight against VAT fraud is one of the areas of priority interest and has paid considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this struggle is evidenced by the conclusions of the study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which external evaluator tried to determine the difference between the legitimate and truly selected amount of VAT in 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as the “EU-25”) during 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on the analysis of available data, the author concluded an analysis to conclude that the estimated amount of losses from the unselected VAT for this period is 90 to 113 billion EUR, with an average of 12% of the legitimate VAT.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">Within the framework of international cooperation, it was stated in the previous audit event that the effective risk management system cannot be developed only by one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">When it comes to risk management system, the SAO conducted control of the EUROCANET system used to exchange information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">cases of risk intra-Community transactions made of EU taxpayers were selected to control, included in the EUROCANET system (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">Targets of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT should also be achieved by establishing the EUROFISC network, which should improve cooperation of responsible authorities in the form enabling fraud detection already in their germ.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later become an important source of information in assessing risks in the performance inside the Community.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of EUROFISC network already on 7 October 200812 and at the same time set the basic principles that this network will be governed.</seg>
<seg id="157">EUROFISC is already a functioning system of fast and selective exchange of EUROCANET information, which has developed a Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risk commercial transactions and entities involved in the organized fraud with VAT.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">Evaluation of recommendations from the first report brought the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions of registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system of taxpayer registration based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance warned the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improving the system is done continuously.</seg>
<seg id="166">At present, data from the questionnaire is electronically processed and will then serve for exploration as part of the risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission submitted a draft amendment to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for registration and registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States requested another clarification and detailed elaboration of the given issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to secure the already achieved level of standards in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, the Act on the Implementation of EU Directives in the national law of law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">This Act contains provisions relating to the monthly submission of aggregate reports on intra-community delivery.</seg>
<seg id="174">The provisions came into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports in order to achieve higher reliability of data in the VIES system and consider the interconnection of both systems for VAT returns and aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group consisting of workers from the federal states and the Federal Ministry of Finance was established.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group elaborated a strategy of automatic comparison of data from VAT tax returns and aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is so far discussed in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the working group dealt with the tool intended to optimize the control procedure for transactions on the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of risk management system at EU level Exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a participant in this exchange within the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and on the basis of a written consultation from 18 October 2006 the establishment of a risk management platform was supplemented to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The platform members are further divided into subgroups dealing with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influencing negotiations, • evaluation, • risk management updates.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the beginning of 2010, reports on the results of these subgroups were published.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The question of the conditions for VAT registration and the interference of this registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 contained an extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="191">He also adjusted the common minimum standards for registration and registration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issue of registration and interference of registration has been left at national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States requested another clarification and detailed elaboration of the given issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of the already achieved standards does not fall in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on the draft regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">It was abandoned from the intention of common minimum standards.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and have only the obligation to inform the Committee for Administrative Cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAI express regret that the Commission could not convince Member States about the necessity of common standards for registration and registration of payers, because both SAI considers these measures a significant element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would have welcomed if the Commission evolved further efforts in the given direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="201">Within the framework of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submission of aggregate reports, enabling timely verification of intra-community transactions values.</seg>
<seg id="202">Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax evasion associated with the fulfilment inside the Community, shortens the period for which aggregate reports on the performance within the EU are submitted, for one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not introduce the obligation to submit a summary report a month according to the specified calendar, while the Czech Republic yes (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports in Germany in order to achieve higher reliability of data in the VIES system and consider the interconnection of both systems for VAT returns and aggregate reports</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendation and established a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The work so far takes place and BRH will monitor further developments in detail.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful criteria, ingredients and approaches of risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purposes of finding traders with a tendency to risk.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO carried out the control of EUROCANET system used to exchange information in the EU (see the car. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform in this area.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Subsequent control of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In the previous control event, the implementation of business transactions was examined together, where there were doubts about their implementation, virtually inconsistency in the way the payers from both countries reported these business transactions in their tax returns, or aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="214">Both control institutions chose for subsequent control of nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany whose control carried out by tax administrators of both countries was not completed during the previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech slices bought in 1. quarter of 2005 goods worth 22 686 EUR from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="217">This purchase of goods by Czech payer did not admit in its tax return, because the German payer did not have VAT ID in the given period, but only tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of an international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003 the Czech tax administrator received information that according to the German VAT Act, the payer who supplies goods to other Member States, assigned VAT ID to intra-Community delivery of goods exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">The subsequent control of the SAO was found that the Czech taxpayer submitted additional tax returns to the Czech tax administrator on the basis of the inspection carried out by the Czech tax administrator in which he admitted the purchase of goods in the given value and at the same time applied to the VAT deduction in the same amount in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">Czech slices had in 4. quarter 2004 to buy from the German payer of goods worth 12 561 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of this goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not bring VAT return in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax administration refused to cooperate on the request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 because the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech tax administrator did not receive funds, he completed the control without finding and tax obligation remained measured in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">The subsequent control of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator received two spontaneous information from Germany according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, from which the German payer of the goods was invoiced to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer acquired goods from the Slovak payer and introduced this acquisition in a proper tax return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">Czech slices had in 4. quarter 2004 to buy a passenger car worth CZK 48,500 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods was not accepted by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer from August 2004 did not submit a VAT tax return, so the tax administrator measured VAT in the amount of CZK 0 in the given quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained within the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, the taxpayer's taxpayer called for an additional tax return to the filing of an additional tax return, but the payer did not apply.</seg>
<seg id="232">Subsequent control was found that the tax administrator carried out another acts in the tax proceedings in 2007 from which it resulted that the personal car of the Czech payer sold the car dealers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment fee for the tax period December 2004, which additionally assessed VAT for the purchase of goods from another Member State and its subsequent sale of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">The resolution of the Regional Court was abolished with the liquidation and the liquidator was established.</seg>
<seg id="235">During the absence of execution of the affected property of the tax debtor, this non-payment seems impregnable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was supposed to carry out the delivery of new means of transport (personal cars) to Germany during 4. quarter of 2004 and 1. quarter of 2005 in the total value of 198 167 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="238">From the response to the application for information according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it resulted that the unclosed tax-punishment proceedings took place against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">During the subsequent inspection of BRH, the information that after the end of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was demonstrably found that the German taxpayer was incorporated into fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">IntraCommunity purchase of goods was taxed worth 182 424 EUR (year 2004) and 369 690 EUR (year 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO found out that the Czech payer was involved in carousel shops with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on the information of the German tax administration concerning the verification of the delivery of goods, a VAT inspection was initiated at the Czech tax entity for the tax period April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax administrator on the basis of control findings and information obtained within the international exchange of information was additionally exchanged by VAT for the period of May 2005 in the amount of 703 031 CZK and for the period June 2005 in the amount of 726 551 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech payer And in February 2005 the machine was acquired from the German payer in the total value of EUR 58,000.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer should deliver in 3. quarter 2004 Czech payer B machine worth 88 027 EUR, payer B, however, this purchase of goods denyed.</seg>
<seg id="247">The subsequent control of the SAO was found that the payer B acquired a machine from the German company, which was established in the Czech Republic by the organizational unit.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer And did not show the purchase of goods from the German payer in his tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="249">In response from the German tax administrator at the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it resulted that the German payer did not take place intra-Community delivery of the machine worth CZK 58,000, but the delivery of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">BRH found out that after the tax inspection was an intra-Community delivery of the machine overcame to the delivery of the machine in the Czech Republic and the exemption from VAT was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German taxpayer had in 3. quarter of 2004 deliver the Czech payer of goods worth CZK 11 600.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO found out that the Czech tax administrator assessed the additional tax return of VAT, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State including the acquisition of goods in the given value was unauthorized.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that after receiving the response to the application for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 the German tax administrator repaired tax returns to the German taxpayer and additionally assessed VAT worth CZK 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Another movement of goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The summary report of the German payer has not yet been repaired because the repairs of the aggregate reports in Germany can only be performed by the payer who filed a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received an application for information from the German tax administration according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car worth CZK 47 400 in February 2005 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="260">After the tax proceedings carried out for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax administrator assessed a tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0 and said to the German tax administrator that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">The subsequent control of the SAO was found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was abolished in 2007 for failure to fulfil obligations and the Czech tax administrator sent documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">The subsequent control of BRH found that the German payer changed the seat and the new locally competent tax administrator cancelled the exemption from VAT for the delivery of the car to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer did not correct the data in the summary report and filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to data from the VIES system, the German payer added to the Czech taxpayer in the period from 3. quarter of 2004 to 1. quarter of 2005 goods in the total value of 33 205 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="266">Subsequent control of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator tried to determine the causes of differences created by the Czech taxpayer when purchasing goods during the period from 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer filed an additional tax return to the VAT for 1. quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator clarified the difference in the value of the acquired goods in the amount of 134 273 CZK for the period 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005, because according to the statement of the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for the individual quarter, and therefore the tax administrator accepted an additional tax return.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German taxpayer added in 3. quarter of 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth 46 854 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="271">The Czech payer for the same period admitted intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only 14 856 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of delivery carried out within the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">3 invoices with the total value of the delivery of goods 31 998 EUR, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT tax return and the data referred to in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">The subsequent control of the SAO was found that the Czech payer filed an additional VAT tax return after many urgene of the tax administrator for the tax period July 2004 in January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="275">In this tax return of the taxpayer, the taxpayer also claimed VAT deduction, thereby the tax obligation for the tax period remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The subsequent check verified that in selected cases of commercial transactions between the payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most tax proceedings were completed and that the tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Germany did adequate measures (i.e. additionally, they exchanged VAT or prevented the tax refund of the entry).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Checking selected cases of risk intraCommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information for detection of risk entities within the Member State in which the goods have been acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared to the relevant local tax authorities with the data acquisition data.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting from 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risk transactions and tax entities ascending as suppliers to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="282">nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected as part of the international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as the buyers of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">The EUROCANET system captured relevant data from tax administrators from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help determine whether suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated by German tax administration as risk entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The auditing operation revealed cases of common business transactions and cases with suspicion of involvement in carousel shops or fraudulent conduct concerning VAT.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the relevant cases, tax administrators used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicion of involvement in risk transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">Financial authorities continuously monitor such tax entities due to their inclusion in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="291">• Financial authorities did not prove deviations from the rules valid for calculating the tax base and VAT, although they found inconsistencies in the field of transport and storage of goods or revealed business relations with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• Verification of business transactions was complicated because some taxpayers did not cooperate with tax administrators and it was not possible to contact them.</seg>
<seg id="293">The relevant tax authorities usually examined risk tax entities and risk transactions listed in the signal information from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="294">The tax administrators at checking risk transactions, especially in connection with the investigation of the so-called missing traders, have limited possibilities and only from physical control of documents is difficult to prove a fraudulent conduct tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter requirements for VAT payers and more flexible interference of registrations would help reduce fraud of type missing trader.</seg>
<seg id="296">In case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT registration is provided for the purpose of reporting fictitious deliveries of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing a formally correct tax documents payers who are unauthorized on their basis of VAT deductions at the entry.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where there is suspected involvement of tax entities in carousel shops and other fraud and import and export of goods from third countries, it would be advisable to ensure greater mutual cooperation of customs and financial bodies.</seg>
<seg id="298">The closer cooperation of these bodies would help in identifying goods and irregularities in the transport documentation and further monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that the activities of the EUROCANET system did not participate in three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom), assessed the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of this system, which should be removed by establishing a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of control in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">This data was a criterion for the selection of six writings of German taxpayers to control.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, refused to actively engage in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is only the recipient of the data from the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="306">The reasoning for this attitude is contained in the following statement: under the opinion of the government, it is not legally permissible that state (public) institutions provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal base that would allow you to infringe applicable regulations on the secret of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data is used within EUROCANET by other Member States.”17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has carried out an analysis of data from EUROCANET and proceeds to the financial authorities of the federal states in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German Financial Authorities receive control information on direct trade relations of payers (registered for specific financial authorities) with traders from other Member States who were included in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information about whether such a trader from another Member State has some risk business relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain business intercourse with the relevant German trader.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">The active participant is inconvenient if some Member States refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result of this fact, the control had to be carried out in different ways in the given area.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal large differences when it comes to revealing VAT fraud cases because EUROCANET is not the only system tool of risk management.</seg>
<seg id="316">However, tax administration of both countries has a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The EU Council came to political agreement on the draft regulation, whose main contribution lies in the establishment of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="318">Part of the expected VAT fight for VAT fraud should also become the experience gained during the use of data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate with their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases submitted to the courts at national and European level show that there is probably a necessary discussion between Member States and the Commission on the conditions of tax exemptions during intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The basic regulation of international cooperation in the enforcement of some financial receivables within the EU is in particular the following directives:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the enforcement of receivables arising from operations that are part of the financing system of the European Agricultural orientation and guarantee fund, as well as agricultural benefits and customs fees;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in debt recovery arising from operations that are part of the financing system of the European Agricultural orientation and guarantee fund, agricultural doses and customs, value added tax and some excise duty;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC, which is carried out by certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in debt recovery arising from some doses, customs, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">252/2000 Coll., on International Assistance in Enforcement of Certain Financial receivables, was implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="328">After receipt of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal system and amending the mentioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, the new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance in Enforcement of Certain Financial Liquids, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">The Commission's Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 is a new regulation on the regulation of international cooperation in the enforcement of certain financial receivables within the EU. 11. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annex to the Regulation stipulates new patterns of applications used from 1. 1. 2009, newly stipulates the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation to confirm the consensus sent documents with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Main principles for providing international cooperation in debt recovery:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance is always provided only on the basis of a request containing the prescribed requirements;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. aid does not apply to financial receivables that have the nature of criminal sanctions in the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. in providing international assistance in enforcement of receivables, it proceeds according to the national law of the state, which was asked for assistance;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign receivables do not prefer when enforcing;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. aid is provided only when enforcing indisputable receivables;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. The principle of exhaustion (depending on the state without success used all usable possibilities to enforce the receivable of its legal order).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms that the assistance is carried out, namely the provision of information, delivery of documents and its own enforcement of receivables.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending requests for debt recovery by other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The local tax office electronically sends an application for information, request for delivery or request for debt recovery together with the relevant documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance through financial headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Finance Ministry will provide the translation of the application to the relevant language, including the annexes and through the CCN/CSI network sends the competent tax administration authority designated to the state.</seg>
<seg id="344">Two basic requirements apply to enforcement: the receivable must be higher than EUR 1,500 and must not be older than 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="345">If the requirements are not met, the requested office may refuse the enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receipt of receivables applications from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">When receiving the application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm the receipt of the application within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides that the applications do not meet, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for rejecting the application and shall present the specific provisions of the Directive.</seg>
<seg id="349">This message must be sent no later than three months from the date of confirmation of receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="350">After accepting the application of the Czech Ministry of Finance, it will verify whether the application has all the requirements under the law, and the application should immediately pass on through the financial headquarters of the local tax office to process.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the application for the enforcement is accepted, the tax administrator, among other things, finds out the property of the debtor, e.g. by purchasing statements from the Land Register, finding accounts in banks, verifying the registration of vehicles on the transport inspectorate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months from the date on which the adoption of the application was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should tell the requesting authority the result of the investigation carried out in order to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In case of non-contact tax entities, when the receivable cannot be enforced, the required authority should also be informed of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="354">Each amount enforced by the tax administrator is transferred to the requiring authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the receivable was enforced.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator excludes a foreign receivables to allow mowing with its payment or payment in instalments, if it pronounced the consent of the state who requested the enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="356">For the period of enforcement, the debtor is prescribed by interest or penalty under Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on Tax Administration and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty belongs to the state who asked for enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of applications received for enforcement of the Czech Ministry of Finance, the locally competent tax administrators did not proceed to processing on time, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found within the framework of international assistance in enforcement of receivables even in the case of applications received from the tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The auditing operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., because it did not realize the locally competent office of the Member State on the progress achieved in the enforcement of within six months of the date on which the receipt of the application was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">Czech Ministry of Finance in accordance with § 13 para. 191/2004 Coll. processes statistical data for the European Commission with indication of the number of applications for information, delivery or enforcement, sent or received in the past year by specifying the above receivables relating to the application.</seg>
<seg id="364">Based on the documents provided from all EU Member States, the European Commission processes a report on the status of debt collection submitted by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance assessed the statistical data as a result of an error in the item enforced by receivables in 2008 by EUR 5 250,000 by specifying the incorrect value of the enforced VAT receivables (the shift of decimal comma after conversion of receivables from Czech crowns to the value of euros was a shift).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance including the enforced amounts is specified in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International assistance in debt recovery in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">Legal authorization to international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from the law of the European Community, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 ( EC Directive on receivables enforcement) and Commission Regulation dated 28 November 2008 (in the EC Treaty).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to more accessible formulation and better clarity of the EC Directive on the enforcement of receivables of Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, whose provisions have been significantly changed several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, among other things, to enforce VAT, income tax and capital income tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Directive on debt recovery was transposed into national German law by law (EC) of the selection of state taxes dated 3 May 2003.</seg>

<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the field of international assistance in debt recovery, all EU Member States govern the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international assistance in debt recovery in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and BRH carried out a comparison of statistics that both Member States submitted for the period 2006-2008 of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not agree.</seg>
<seg id="487">In 2006, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 2009, the Commission concluded that the incidence of discrepancies in statistics decreased, although the number of applications increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAI considers it important to discuss the statistics of the statistics again at the EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persisting discrepancies, otherwise the data provided by the EU will not be reliable in statistics and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAI agree in the opinion that reliable statistics have an annual number of applications and also the nature of relevant receivables (i.e. whether the receivables relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) and the amount of receivables enforced by individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAI considers it important that the Commission provide more detailed analyses of statistics submitted by Member States because it can help Member States assess their own effectiveness in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that it is possible to calculate the degree of enforcement of receivables in the subdivision of individual Member States consider both SAI to be useful for Member States with a lower degree of enforcement to intensify their efforts and to improve the degree of enforcement of receivables at least to the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If any Member State wish, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">Especially in 2006 and 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit to the local tax administrators a request for debt recovery in time.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found in applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The auditing operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance in Enforcement of receivables, because it did not inform the locally competent office of the Member State on the progress achieved in enforcement of within six months from the date on which the receipt of the application was confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="565">Germany: No, uniform statistics on the federal level for tax auditors contain only information about the average time of the last control (information about the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This data does not provide an overview of selected control periods with regard to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT auditors focus on the latest tax assessment period; they also have the right to check VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, statistics created on the federal level for the departments of special VAT inspections do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• There are some statistics or records of the nature of additionally created tax revenues, divided e.g. according to these criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax obligation (e.g. in cases where the tax entity unauthorizedly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only a nominal increase in tax obligation (e.g. a transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional selection of tax revenues (payment of due additional taxes).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax verification carried out, the volumes of additionally measured tax divided by the type of tax, according to the number of audited tax entities and according to the number of audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigation, dialing proceedings) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">The time data and the amount of additionally paid taxes are registered as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">The general debt statistics are also divided according to the type of tax, but not according to the declared tax or tax identified by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics on the federal level for tax inspections and for the departments of special VAT inspections do not distinguish between the criteria stated.</seg>
<seg id="579">In addition, these differences do not distinguish even most of the tax administrators visited.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are the areas of control arise from which high additional revenues arise?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to select taxpayers for verification based on the criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special ADIS sections.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations on the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">From this it follows that uniform statistics on the federal level for tax control and for the formations of special VAT inspections do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach of finance ministers of federal states and federal governments.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax auditors or tax investigators from the federal states must write a measured increased tax (VAT) obligation if exceeding a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, it must specify e.g. the nature of the measured increase in the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What findings are the most common?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS applies unauthorized claim to tax deduction for deliveries and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to § 72 para. 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation according to § 75 para. 3 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• Based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements set out in § 73 para. 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- The VDS did not declare VAT at the output pursuant to § 21 para. 1 VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It was said that there were no regulations on the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">From this it follows that uniform statistics on the federal level for tax control and for the formations of special VAT inspections do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">Determination of VAT is not registered by federal countries separately if they arise from the VDS tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax auditors or tax investigators must write up the measured increased tax (VAT) the obligation if exceeds a certain amount, the Federal Central Financial Office is able to analyze this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration perform an analysis of control areas from which a high “development” implies and deduces the consequences for leadership?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they start national audits focused on risk commodities or on the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations on the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Unified statistics on the Federal Level for Tax Controls and for the departments of special VAT inspections do not provide data on the areas of audit from which the high “inside” arises.</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different opinions on the analysis process as well as the management of cases in terms of significance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but their use is on their own consideration of the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">The differences in the answers of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects the amount of data from tax inspections made and data from financial statements reports - balance sheets and statements of profit and loss.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to direct the selection of cases with a tendency to risk.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the analysis and control of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the establishment of a specialized tax office for the management of the VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">It follows that it is more difficult to perform these tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, the philosophy of Germany puts more emphasis on the selection of individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">Risk management ingredients will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to measure the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAI agreed in the opinion that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management and corresponding risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce income outages.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the yield of VAT selection and the level of risk detection in unreliable entrepreneurs will increase.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of both SAI on parallel audits of VAT management fulfilled the objectives set out in the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">Both SAI better met each other valid systems in these areas: • intra-Community transactions, • VAT risk management, especially when it comes to the selection of transactions with a tendency to risk, • assistance in debt recovery and • VAT control for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in the strategies of determining the cases of VAT fraud and differences in the above areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and proven practices were identified on their basis.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAI hopes to become an impulse for stakeholders to start a discussion of approaches and strategies inside the Member States, among them at the European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">Extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAI can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future auditing events in the field of VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communications</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="626">Edial deadline: June 2010.</seg>
