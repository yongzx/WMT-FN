<seg id="1">Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="3">The material presented reports on the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolní úradom Slovenskej republiky, which focused on the field of value added tax administration and the use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so that the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel control actions were aimed, in particular, at checking the tax authorities' process for examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between individual Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of VIES made it possible to exchange information electronically on the registration of value added tax payers in the various Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by those payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the VIES data and the data in the taxpayer's VAT return should alert the tax authorities to suspicious cases and allow tax evasion or fraud to be detected.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefits of the parallel checks carried out were not only in the exchange of information on the procedure followed by the financial and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular in the examination of the use of the VIES system in checking the application of the right to value added tax exemption in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained from the implementation of parallel controls is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used to carry out further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel controls on the administration of value added tax for the period 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the tax authorities' procedures for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and the performance of VIES tasks for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO, the Czech Republic) and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded a contract on cooperation in auditing activities on 12 September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of parallel auditing actions “Value Added Tax Administration”, included in the SAO, Czech Republic's 2005 audit work plan under No 05/19, and “Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and recovery of taxes on prized value and fulfilment of roles under the VIES system on the deletion of informácii medzi by the members of ECA”, included in the SAO's audit work plan under No 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The control actions carried out in parallel were in the nature of coordinated control.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated inspection has been processed within the meaning of the European Enforcement Regulation No 31 on INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of supply and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between taxpayers of value added tax from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SR’).</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties contractually undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on requests received and sent to examine commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the control was carried out by the state budget department and territorial departments of central Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: the Tax Office in Mlada Boleslav, the Tax Office in Kolín, the Tax Office in Teplice, the Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Office in Tábor, the Financial Office in Brno III, the Tax Office in Znojma, the Financial Office in Zlín, the Financial Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office in Ostrava I, the Financial Office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit was carried out in the territory of SR by the Finance and Tax Division of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the SAO Expozituras of Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Bratislava I, Komárno Tax Office, Trenčín Tax Office, Prievidza Daňový úrad, Zvolen Daňový úrad, Dolný Kubín Daňový úrad, Košice II Daňový úrad, Košice V and Michalovce Daňový úrad.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of inspections:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of the financial and/or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (VAT) following the incorporation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited period of the coordinated inspection was the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States, allowing tax authorities to check whether a supplier has been authorised to exempt a taxable transaction from VAT and, in the country of destination, to check whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit found differences in the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The recapitulative statements indicate the values of supplies of goods to other EU Member States, the values of services provided are not included in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from summary reports filed by Czech payers are processed at the level of tax authorities in the Czech Republic, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States included in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to the other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In SR, data from recapitulative statements filed by Slovak taxpayers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of SR (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values reported in the recapitulative statements with the values of supplies of goods according to VAT tax returns and to identify any differences between them.</seg>
<seg id="36">In SR, the values of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on a common line of VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, in SR, the system does not make it possible to automatically identify differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of goods delivery values in VAT returns allows the results of data reconciliation to be used in controlling VAT exemption of supplies of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">The data received from the recapitulative statements filed by payers in other EU Member States are processed into CLOs and compared with the value of acquisitions of goods declared by payers from the Czech Republic and SR respectively in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, these data are sent to the tax authorities, and the tax authorities decide for themselves which cases of difference to examine.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of delivery and acquisition of goods must be checked by the tax authorities, and gives a list of these cases to the tax authorities responsible locally.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that, for the most significant derogations, it will be verified that VAT was correctly declared when the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="43">Furthermore, the audit highlighted some problems in the VAT management system due to the different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summary reports are filed in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum period for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reducing the reporting period of recapitulative statements to one month, together with reducing the processing time, would allow earlier access to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">Tax authorities would thus be able to check more effectively whether VAT was declared at the correct amount when intra-Community acquisitions were made.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax year (month) would allow quicker verification of whether the payer has declared in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return the same value of the supplies of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="48">Differences between EU-payer declared goods delivery values and those reported by CR and SR payers were due, among other things, to different reporting of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions data across EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These were, for example, the presentation in recapitulative statements of advance payments received, or the presentation in a supplier's recapitulative statement of intra-Community supplies in a quarter other than intra-Community acquisitions in the acquirer's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">The harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was also aimed at examining selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="52">A total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined together, where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicions of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic have found out the following:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities have declared in their VAT returns for the purpose of unduly obtaining an excess VAT deduction the execution of intra-Community transactions which have not actually been carried out;</seg>
<seg id="55">Tax Entities reported intra-Community deliveries in carousel transactions, in which there were deliberate multiple decreases in the value of the deliveries in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers declared in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">the suppliers made an intra-Community supply of VAT-exempt goods to tax entities which were not registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In those cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than the intra-Community acquisitions declared by the acquirers, in some cases with an incorrect amount of VAT declared.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lessons learned from the audit action showed that VIES provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">In particular, tax administrations should pay close attention to rigorously examining the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES data and using any information in tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="62">Value Added Tax Issues After the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic Join the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">Internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within EU territory have been abolished since EU accession.</seg>
<seg id="66">Until 30.4.2004, the VAT administrator was the competent financial and tax office, with the exception of the importation of goods and occasional bus services within the country, where the tax authority was the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the context of the adoption of the new Act No 235/2004 Coll. on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No 235/2004 Coll.") and Act No 222/2004 Col. on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Act No 222/2004 Coll."), the administration of VAT on the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU Member States has shifted from customs offices to financial and tax offices respectively.</seg>
<seg id="68">The supply of goods in the Czech Republic, according to the provisions of Section 13 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">The delivery of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the delivery of goods that have actually been dispatched or transported to another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="70">Pursuant to Article 64 of Law 235/2004 Coll., a taxable transaction is exempt with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">A supply of goods in SR under the provisions of Article 8 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z. is a supply of tangible property in which the right to property is altered.</seg>
<seg id="72">The transfer of goods owned by a taxable person from the territory of the country to another Member State shall also be regarded as a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">Pursuant to Article 43 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., the supply of goods from the national territory to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the purchaser is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="74">Acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic pursuant to Section 16 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. is the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods that are dispatched or transported to the customer by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Czech payer purchases goods at a VAT-free price and is obliged to declare VAT in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of Section 25 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., if he fulfils the conditions of Section 73 of this Act, he is entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">Acquisition of goods domestically from another EU Member State in SR, pursuant to Article 11 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported to the person acquiring it by or on behalf of the supplier or the person acquiring it within the country from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">The SR tax becomes chargeable to the payer when the goods are acquired within the country from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of Act No 222/2004 Z.z.</seg>
<seg id="78">Under Paragraph 49 of Act No 222/2004, the taxpayer may deduct VAT if the tax is charged by him on the acquisition within the country of goods from another Member State in accordance with Paragraphs 11 and 11a of that Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">Three-digit trade is, according to the provisions of Section 17 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and/or Section 45 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z., a trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States where the object of the trade is the supply of the same goods between the three persons.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intra-unitary transactions are supplies and acquisitions of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions made between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="82">VIES system</seg>
<seg id="83">A VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU to control the exercise of the right to VAT exemption on intra-Community supplies of goods.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows EU Member State tax authorities to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and vice versa, whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State develops its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">The national systems work on a common principle and are interconnected via a common EU communication network, the Common Communication Network (CCN; see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was linked to the Automated Tax Information System (‘ADIS’), in the Slovak Republic with the Tax Information System Application Software (‘APV DIS’).</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by the financial and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the management of taxes and charges.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU country receives information on tax entities that it would not be able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is to combat tax evasion and tax losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State establishes a central department within the internal organisational structure in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the management of VAT, the Central Liaison Office (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the International Cooperation in VAT Administration Unit (hereinafter referred to as the MF CLO) has been established, performs the tasks arising from international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The function of the CLO in the SR is fulfilled by the Tax Directorate of the SR, the Department of International Administrative Cooperation (DR CLO).</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments communicate with EU foreign administrations in particular in the area of exchange of information under VIES, exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, verification of tax identification numbers (TIN) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to examine a particular intra-Community transaction or to obtain further information relating to a particular tax entity, the financial and tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via MF CLO or DR CLO respectively.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use to correctly determine VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information are sent mostly in electronic form between the CLOs of EU Member States, using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was mainly aimed at examining selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states, as well as the level of use of information obtained through international cooperation by the financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">The SAO, Czech Republic, requested the SAO SR to verify in 30 cases the business transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">The SAO requested the SAO of the Czech Republic to verify in 10 cases the business transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">Examination of intra-Community transactions revealed, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, Czech Republic asked the SAO SR to verify the procedure of the tax administration, which was sent a reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak Tax Office requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of goods (footwear) in Q3 2004 from a Slovak payer worth 2 847 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="108">The Tax Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer had declared the acquisition of the goods at this value only in a supplementary VAT return and had returned the same goods to Slovak tax entities worth CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">Based on the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the tax office of the Slovak supplier has fully recognised the right to an excess VAT deduction arising, inter alia, from this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">This tax office did not provide information about the suspected re-export to the tax authorities locally responsible buyers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">This will provide an impetus for further examination of trading activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of a technology line to SR worth 4,850,000 CZK in the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax procedure carried out in SR showed that only part of the technology line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">In examining this case, the SAO SR found that the VAT on the taxable transaction carried out was declared by the Slovak taxpayer on the amount of CZK 4 850,000 in the VAT return (DAP) for tax year 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO, Czech Republic also found that the Czech payer had reported in his DAP an excess VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 for that quarter, which was generated by the application of a VAT deduction on the purchase of this technology line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">Based on the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak Tax Entities had formed a business relationship for the purpose of illegally obtaining an excess VAT deduction, disputed the realisation of the taxable transaction and failed to recognise part of the Czech taxpayer's right to deduct the amount of CZK 647,000.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">The Slovak tax administration requested in 2004, via the SCAC form, a verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer worth 24 246K Sk made in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">These goods were purchased by a Slovak payer in November 2002 in SR from another tax entity for a value of 29 667 thousand Sk and subsequently sold to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak taxpayer claimed an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="122">A tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administration and did not file DAPs for the 4th quarter of 2002 or the following period.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO SR found that the Slovak tax administration, based on the outcome of the tax inspection, did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of EUR 5 541 000. Sk applied in the DAP for the month of 11/2002 and set the tax liability at 1 750 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted a VAT exemption in respect of exports of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the purchased goods for Q3 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to the VIES data, the Czech payer was to purchase from SR goods (diluent) worth 3,767 thou.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administration, did not file a DAP and was assessed ex officio VAT for months 7 to 12/2004 at the rate of 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form to verify whether the delivery of goods from SR to the Czech Republic took place, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In reply, Slovakia's locally competent tax office sent a copy of the invoice, the bill of lading and a demand for payment of the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with a right to deduct VAT on that supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administration had assessed the response to the request for information received from SR as evidence showing that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">Upon further investigation, the Tax Office in the Czech Republic will request a superior authority to review the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (particle products) to, among others, an American company that deposited these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of this free zone was listed on invoices as the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, for example, an American company purchased $57,600 worth of particle board from a Slovak payer (at a unit price of $100/piece), which it placed in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred ownership of the goods to a Swiss company, for a value of USD 14 400 (unit price USD 25/piece) and the goods were exported back to SR.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the free zone area on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax administration has initiated tax inspections of individual tax years 2004 and 2005 with the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="141">The verification of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech locally competent tax authorities via several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">Individual responses gradually built up a picture of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO of the Slovak Republic, found that in these trade relations there was a deliberate gradual decrease in the value of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the information gathered, the SR Tax Directorate concluded that in this case of carousel trade there is free pricing (i.e. the importation of undervalued goods and its overestimation by domestic companies in the importer-exporter chain) which is not an infringement of the VAT Act in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="145">Under current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be avoided as they fulfil all the conditions of the Act to exempt supplies from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">The Czech taxpayer had his VAT registration revoked on 12 July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="148">On 27 October 2005, following a voluntary application for VAT registration, that body became taxable again.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Czech taxpayer entered into the DAP for the month of 8/2005 (i.e. the period when he was not subject to VAT) the value of the acquisition of goods (a printing press) from SR amounting to CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to a supply of goods from a Slovak payer amounting to 1 530 thousand Sk, which the Slovak payer listed in the DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State with a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify the said delivery using the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier had not shown how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administration and did not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax authority to examine the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer reported in the recapitulative statement for Q3 2004 supplies of goods worth 956K. Sk tax entity from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">The Czech entity's VAT number was marked as erroneous by VIES.</seg>
<seg id="157">A check in the payers' database revealed that such a TIN was never allocated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electro-fitting works on real estate in the Czech Republic, not the delivery of goods from SR to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT as the Czech entity told the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax administration requested to verify the facts by using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, the Czech Republic, by enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic, found that the tax entity named on the invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not declare the tax on the services received from the Slovak entity and did not declare the tax on the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">There was no local investigation or tax check with the Czech entity, its current whereabouts are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authorities learned that the Czech taxpayer had become a taxpayer of VAT by law by accepting the service.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax audit for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">The Slovak payer reported in the recapitulative statement for Q3 2004 the delivery of goods worth CZK 1,055,000. Sk to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electro-fitting works on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">This was not a supply of goods from SR to the Czech Republic, but a supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax administration requested to verify the facts by using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, the Czech Republic, enquired at the local tax administration in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the supply and that a local investigation was carried out on it to verify the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that the present case was not really an acquisition of goods but an acquisition of services, which was also reported by the Czech entity in a proper DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">Furthermore, the tax office found that the Czech operator had not paid VAT at the correct amount for the tax period of Q3 2004 as a result of a bad procedure in the calculation of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tax entity shall submit an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">The SAO SR enquired at the local competent tax office and found that the Slovak payer had misstated the provision of the service in the recapitulative statement and would be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech tax entity has voluntarily registered as a VAT payer since 10 March 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For Q1 2004, DAP reported high turnover on both inputs and outputs.</seg>
<seg id="178">The locally competent tax administration initiated the tax procedure, the subject did not cooperate with the tax administration, so he was assessed VAT of 0 CZK due to suspicion of involvement in the carousel business.</seg>
<seg id="179">Another DAP was not filed by that payer.</seg>
<seg id="180">He had his VAT registration cancelled on 4.1.2005 because of a failure to comply with the law.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to the VIES data, this entity was to acquire from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004 goods worth 7,846K Sk.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the execution of these transactions, the Czech tax authorities sent two requests for information to SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The SAO SR enquired at the local tax office and found that the manager of the Czech company had denied the transactions examined in testimony and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">As a result of the SR tax procedure, intra-Community deliveries to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer were challenged.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be recognised as entitled to VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (work clothes) from SR in the 1st quarter of 2005 for a total value of 39 970 thou Sk.</seg>
<seg id="188">In this quarter, the Czech payer reported acquisitions of goods from another EU Member State only in DAP for the month 3/2005, amounting to CZK 11,292,000.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax administration carried out a local investigation on the subject to verify the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">As the company did not produce any documents or otherwise prove that the taxable transactions had been carried out, the tax authorities charged VAT of CZK 0 on 9 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to doubts about the realisation of the acquisition of the goods, the tax authorities sent two requests for information to SR in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the reply to the requests for information, the SR tax authorities had doubts about the realisation of business cases as well as the realisation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated inspection, the local tax administration was carrying out further enquiries concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic, while an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of involvement in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions in goods (working clothes) were made between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak payer No 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No 3, who supplied them back to SR to payer No 4 (see Diagram No 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech payer No 2 was to purchase goods (work clothes) worth 4,847,000 CZK from Slovak payer No 1 in Q4 2004 and goods worth 17,050,000 CZK in Q1 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the VIES data, the locally competent tax authority sent a request for information to SR on 25.5.2005.</seg>
<seg id="203">In reply, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the realisation of the business cases as well as the realisation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8.6.2005, a request for information was received at MF CLO from SR, concerning goods worth 16 575 thou Sk to be delivered by Slovak payer No 1 to Czech payer No 2 in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side demanded to check whether the Czech No 2 had actually accepted the goods, admitted them in the DAP and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">An official record drawn up by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech taxpayer No 2 has not resided at an address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax year, he filed a DAP for the quarterly tax year.</seg>
<seg id="208">In view of this, the Czech tax authorities could not assess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">Implementation of the taxable transaction between Slovak payer No 1 and Czech payer No 2 mentioned in the application in the amount of EUR 16 575,000. Sk could not be verified due to the above.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel business for the purpose of drawing an excess VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="211">(B)</seg>
<seg id="212">Czech payer No 3, who deals with the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of months 1 and 2/2005, in which he declared the supply of goods (work clothes) to Slovak payer No 4 for a total value of CZK 21,935,000.</seg>
<seg id="213">These work clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No 3 from Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to SR, mainly to verify that Slovak payer No 4 had purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from Czech payer No 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in Q1 2005.</seg>
<seg id="215">The response to this request for information received from SR showed that in the DAP for the month 12/2004 the Slovak payer No 4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was only 1 193 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="216">No 4 did not respond to the request for tax documents for the tax period of months 10/2004 to 3/2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">A local investigation carried out in SR revealed that the company was not located at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">The reply further stated that this payer meets all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent the DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out at the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax authorities collected documents that would confirm or deny the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be calculated on the basis of the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case is also being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="223">Control Action Progress</seg>
<seg id="224">In order to prepare for the parallel audits, a coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants in that meeting were acquainted with the VAT legislation in both states and the incorporation of the VIES electronic system into the national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The negotiations resulted in the specification of the extent of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">The two sides agree that cooperation will focus on the following areas: (b) verifying data on intra-Community acquisitions reported in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as ‘SH’) of payers from the SR included in the VIES system, and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on the commercial transactions made.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be made following the volume of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intracomunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure for processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic for intra-Community supply and acquisition of goods is shown in the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intracomunitary Delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">Where a VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he shall be required to submit to the SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">A payer in the Czech Republic presents in the SH summary information on his VAT-exempt supplies of goods to another EU Member State for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in SR is obliged to enter into the SH the value of goods that have been exempt and delivered from the national territory to other EU Member States for the calendar quarter period.</seg>
<seg id="235">The data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in the SH in Czech and Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their TIN, under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Service data are not included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If a payer in the Czech Republic discovers that he has given erroneous data in the SH, he is obliged to give a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the payer in SR finds that the information given in the SH was incomplete or incorrect, he shall submit a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for the submission of the SH, after which time he shall submit an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">VIES allows the exchange of information on VAT registered payers' registration data in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payees from the Czech Republic and SR respectively can verify that the respective purchaser's TIN is registered in a given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">Data from submitted SHs are grouped by individual TIN of purchasers on the MF CLO and DR CLO respectively by VIES.</seg>
<seg id="242">It will create the aggregate value of all deliveries for each VAT number of the acquirer and the code of the delivery method from all its Czech and Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from files L1QDs shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-Community transactions between CR and SR (from L1QD files) is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="245">If VIES in another Member State detects a wrong customer ID in the L1QD files sent, it generates the so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all the wrong VAT number, indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This report is then sent to the MF CLO or DR CLO respectively.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL message can contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous TIN, TIN not registered in the state or never allocated, the purchaser with a TIN was not subject to VAT in the quarter, the purchaser's VAT registration was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, the MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the wrong TIN of the EU payer is used in any of the SH or subsequent SH lines sent, a so-called "Notice of Doubt to VAT ID" is generated at the relevant IRS by the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office will check that the delivery to a taxpayer registered for VAT in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In SR, the DR CLO in VIES processes all O_MCTL messages and transmits them electronically to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of the taxpayers who have given the wrong TIN in their SHs.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities then invite the payer to submit an additional SH and, when reporting invalid TIN in the SH file, the tax office checks the delivery of the goods with the relevant payer.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of erroneous TIN relating to intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="254">Of the total number of 41 728 TIN Czech payers listed in the SH Slovak payers during the period from Q2 2004 to Q1 2005, 929 were erroneous TIN, or 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the 62,997 TIN of Slovak payers listed in the SH of Czech payers during the same period, 416 were erroneous TIN, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous TIN's in their SH than SR payers.</seg>
<seg id="257">An examination of the activities of the financial and tax authorities revealed that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of taxable persons in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the taxpayer's registration in Q4 2004 when questioned by the Tax Administrator in the Czech Republic, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation found that the termination of the registration took place only on 1.1.2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO also found that 6 tax entities filed an SH in which the wrong TIN was reported, but the O_MCTL reports did not include this TIN.</seg>
<seg id="262">In SR, the submitted SHs are converted into electronic form at the tax offices and the data from them is sent to the DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">Following the subsequent processing of this data in VIES, the DR CLO shall send to the relevant tax authorities the so-called SH error breakdowns submitted by the tax entities for the respective quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH at 26.7.2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and at 2.2.2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the inspection).</seg>
<seg id="265">The data reconciliation is presented in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="266">The above data show that the SAO audit of SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with erroneous TIN (on average by 199 SH per quarter) but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-Community deliveries reported by the payer in the relevant DAP rows is compared at the financial offices with the value of intra-Community deliveries reported by this payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ADIS system automatically indicates differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax manager should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained in determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values in SH and DAP in these cases was 537,231,000 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="272">Since Q3 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administration in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values given in the SH and the DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-Community supplies according to the SH as a match and to set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intra-Community deliveries per quarter, 0.5% of the value is a not insignificant amount, therefore tax administrations in these cases should not set the SH and DAP compliance without explaining the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, the tax administrator, without verification, set the match in case of a difference in values of CZK 1,561,000.</seg>
<seg id="275">Examination of differences in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was complicated by the fact that SH was filed by payers for each calendar quarter within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">Tax authorities could not compare the intra-community delivery values in those DAPs with the SH values for payers with a monthly tax year at the time of DAP submission for the first two months of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In those cases, the tax authorities became aware of any data mismatch in the DAPs and SHs only when the tax liability or excess VAT deduction was assessed or refunded.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intracomanial acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">VIES provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions made within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, data received from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered by L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">In the processing, the data are recalculated by the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the acquisition value reported by the Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of acquisitions reported by payers in the DAP should be within the minimum and maximum converted values of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in the DAP is less than L1min, a so-called validation order is generated for payers with the most significant irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders concerning audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, Czech Republic found that in 33 cases audited financial authorities did not check for irregularities in the values of intra-Community acquisitions indicated by the verification orders received.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the values reported in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases was at least CZK 148,319,000.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, Czech Republic selected for inspection 533 files of tax entities for which audited tax authorities received a verification order from MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the following cases, the most common causes of the differences between the values given in the purchaser's DAP and in the supplier's SH were found: on the purchaser's side (Czech payer), in 263 cases, the purchaser did not declare the purchase of goods in the correct DAP, in 93 cases the payer acknowledged the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than the one in which he was required to declare VAT, in 6 cases the purchaser reported the value of goods acquired in the wrong line of the DAP, on the supplier's side (EU payer's) in 88 cases the EU payer included the value of goods in their SHSR included the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the SR payers' side, the most frequent erroneous inclusion of the value of the services provided was in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were identified at audited tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 was created by the Slovak payer entering into the SH for the 1st quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods including assembly in the territory of the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of the received advances in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers indicated in the SH received advances from Czech payers, resulting in a command to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to verify acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where data from the SH are subsequently changed in EU Member States, such as a change in the purchaser of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new validation orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES system does not automatically notify these changes, the locally competent tax authority of the person acquiring the goods may, without any other initiative, be unaware of the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired, and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">An audit by the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer reported in the SH for Q2 2004 the value of the supply of goods to the Czech payer at 1 504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1.2.2005, the tax office of the locally competent Czech payer sent a request for information to SR, as the Czech payer admitted acquiring goods only in the amount of CZK 425,000.</seg>
<seg id="301">As a result of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional BI on 1 March 2005, in which he corrected the details of the delivery of the goods to the Czech Republic, by reducing the value of the delivery for the Czech payer initially mentioned to 538K. Sk and by increasing the value of the goods delivered to another Czech payer from the amount of £194,000. Sk to the value of 1,160 thou Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers reported intra-Community deliveries to payers from the Czech Republic totalling 10,240,000 CZK (or 8,183,000 CZK) in their SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="303">However, the Czech acquirers did not report intra-Community acquisitions in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of the international exchange of information, it was established that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer not mentioned in the SH filed by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the 1st quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intra-Community deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of 10 240 thou in the additional SH relating to the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the correctness of the data in DAP's submission for Q2 2004, even if the actual acquirer failed to comply with the obligation to declare intra-Community acquisitions for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, Czech Republic, found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech taxpayer was additionally assessed VAT for tax years 5 and 6/2004 of 3,640,000 CZK and for Q3 2004 of 3,305,000 CZK on purchased goods during these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">It can be seen from the above that tax administrations have had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences arising from errors in the acquirer's DAP, but also differences due to different reporting of intra-Community supply and acquisition data across EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">Unifying the conditions for reporting these data would lead to streamlining the control activities of tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In SR, the APV DIS system makes it possible to compare the data on the value of goods acquired through VIES from other EU Member States with the data listed in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which the data are compared is called the ‘MIN-MAX method’.</seg>
<seg id="313">This method recalculates the delivery values of the goods specified in the BI of payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rate for the quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="314">The MIN-MAX interval will be created, which is used for comparisons with the acquisition values listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">The DR CLO will send information to tax administrations on the values of intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP and the values of EU deliveries in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax authorities will decide for which VAT-registered persons the difference will be checked, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">Based on data provided by the DR CLO, the SAO collected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at audited tax offices, of which 25 payers also acquired goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and those declared in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="318">The audit carried out by the SAO of the Slovak Republic confirmed that the tax authorities did not rigorously verify the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data given in the Slovak acquirers' DAP.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the audit of SAO SR at tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies, which showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU member countries, the following were found to be among others:</seg>
<seg id="322">In the DAP for Q4 2004, the Slovak payer did not give the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that a company from the Czech Republic had mistakenly given the VAT number of this payer in SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while goods worth 19 184 thousand CZK were actually delivered to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">Under the VIES system, the Slovak company was to acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4th quarter of 2004 worth MIN 682 692 thousand Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company filed DAPs for the periods in which it reported an EU acquisition value of only 480 599 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and to DAP did not indicate intra-Community deliveries by invoice date, but by delivery date.</seg>
<seg id="328">Due to further irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax authorities will request a verification of the value of the goods supplied using SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">Acquisition of goods from EU member countries in Q4 2004 was not reported by the Slovak payer in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">Under the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11,286 thousand Sk and MAX 11,845 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office carried out a local investigation, which showed that the taxpayer had not purchased any goods from EU member countries in Q4 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO recommended that the tax office request a verification of the delivery of goods from EU member countries via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the VIES system, delivery of goods to a Slovak customer of MIN 557,000 Sk and MAX 565,000 Sk was reported.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the DAP for the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not report any acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">A local investigation by the tax administration found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier in the Czech Republic on 10 December 2004 for materials consumed in the repair of a hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO recommended a tax audit of the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, in 16 cases the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit on the tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections will be filed by the tax authorities after their implementation by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="340">Examples were:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak purchaser did not declare the acquisition of goods from EU member countries in the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004 and did not declare any tax for the tax period of 10 to 12/2004 and claimed a refund of excess VAT totalling 1,236 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation which showed that the taxpayer had purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth EUR 683,000 (about EUR 27,080,000 Sk).</seg>
<seg id="343">The said goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">A Slovak payer for customers in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for the amount of EUR 683,000, which was not mentioned in the DAP submission.</seg>
<seg id="345">The tax authority carries out a tax audit on the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for Q3 2004 to Q1 2005 and the data on deliveries reported by EU member state payers for each quarter was a total of 4,800,000 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the taxpayer purchased goods from suppliers in the Czech Republic and Belgium and then sold those goods to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by an export single customs declaration.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not specified by the tax entity, according to the statement of the company's manager, goods in transit were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records at the time of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">A tax audit has been initiated on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International Level L3 Information Exchange</seg>
<seg id="353">The exchange of information at level L3 is initiated by locally competent tax administrations who send their requests for information (RFID) or spontaneous information (SPI) relating to a particular tax entity or transaction through MF CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="354">DR CLO to another EU member country. For example, the objective of the LIO is to demonstrate the execution of a given transaction in intra-Community transactions, to verify a certain TIN, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of SPI, this is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the exchange of information is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for responding to YEI was set at 3 months in Article 8 of this Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for the admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which provides that, unless otherwise agreed by the Participating States, the ŽOI must relate to commercial transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">Where the RU relates to a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond in view of its workload.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure for handling received YEI by the Tax Administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of the internal timescales set for processing at individual organisational levels, is illustrated in the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the SR, the deadline for the discharge of the RU by the tax authorities has been set internally at 2 months so that the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 can be met.</seg>
<seg id="362">The MF CLO accepted a total of 29 RWs and 3 SPIs from SR from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 RUs accepted, 26 (or 89.7%) were discharged within the time limit of 3 months and 3 (or 10.3%) were discharged after that time limit.</seg>
<seg id="364">During the same period, DR CLO accepted a total of 71 ZhOI and 7 SPI from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 RUs accepted, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were discharged within the stipulated time limit of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were discharged after this time limit (for the remaining 2 cases, no discharge deadline could be determined from the material transmitted).</seg>
<seg id="366">More detailed data on the time taken to process YES received by MF CLOs and DR CLOs are given in the following graph.</seg>
<seg id="367">Reasons for sending an APO, as stated on SCAC forms, are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">Compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, in particular to monitor the exercise of the right to VAT exemption, has been tested on the basis of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intra-Community transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="371">An examination of the selected transactions revealed that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of the two countries had detected cases of companies making fictitious intra-Community commercial transactions to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers had failed to declare the correct amount of VAT on supplies received.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the audit found differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also highlighted problems caused by different reporting of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions data across EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">The harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="375">Examination of the VAT administration and use of the VIES system by the financial and tax authorities revealed that the VIES system was not sufficiently used by all VIES options and the relevant statutory authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="376">Furthermore, it was found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on deliveries of goods and on the validity of taxable persons' VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with the data processed after the completion of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="378">From the comparison of these data, it was clear that the SAO audit of SR had an effect not only on reducing the number of IA with erroneously reported TIN, but also on reducing the number of unrepaired errors in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In case of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, Czech Republic did not have such an option under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The lessons learned from the audit action showed that VIES provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">As there continues to be scope for tax evasion in this area, increased attention needs to be paid to intra-community transactions when managing VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material provides an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which focused on the area of administration based on added value and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the control cooperation agreement concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of the parallel control actions was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenue of the national budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of value added tax, allowing the refund of excess deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise duty, particularly on tobacco and tobacco products, ethyl alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given the need to address this issue comprehensively across the European Union, the VAT Working Group has been set up by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, with both countries' highest audit offices actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of the control actions undertaken can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax management in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the framework of planned indirect tax controls, mainly aimed at involving the tax administrations of the two States in the VIES system, which allows the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union to be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the Value Added Tax and Excise Administration Review for 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Object of control:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Control of the tax administration process for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="18">On 11.2.2004, the Contract for Cooperation in Audit Activities between the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (SAO SR) was concluded. The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of parallel control actions "Value Added Tax and Excise Tax," included in the SAO's 2004 audit work plan under No 04/07, and "Control of the management process of dane pri administration, control and recovery of taxes on prized value and rebrebrebrebate taxes," included in SAO SR's audit work plan under No 18/2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties undertook in the contract to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from the tax files kept by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the relevant State.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic), the control was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of southern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected financial offices: the Tax Office for Prague 1, the Tax Office for Prague 3, the Tax Office in Český Budějovice, the Tax Office in Frýdek-Místek, the Tax Office in Hodonin, the Tax Office in Jihlava, the Tax Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, the Tax Office in Kroměříž, the Tax Office in Písek, the Tax Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, the Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Velký Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘SR’) was carried out by the Tax and Customs Division of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO Expozituras SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">Bratislava Tax Office pre Selected Tax Entities, Bratislava Tax Office III, Trnava Tax Office, Pú-chov Tax Office, Banská Bystrica Tax Office I, Liptovský Mikuláš Tax Office, Žilina Tax Office I, Žilina II Tax Office, Košice Tax Office I and Košice Tax Office IV.</seg>
<seg id="26">Target of control</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the control actions was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of financial and tax authorities and customs authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties, with a focus on the collection of such taxes on the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the Customs Database and the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic and to verify them in tax returns at the relevant financial and tax offices respectively.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Review of control results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">In the framework of the international cooperation of the SAO, the SAO of the Czech Republic transmitted from the Customs Database 22 206 items of the Uniform Customs Declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and vice versa, the SAO of the Slovak Republic forwarded 30 221 items of the JCD to the SAO of the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison was made between the printed JCD items from the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Customs database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Out of 5,883 selected JCD items from the CR Customs Database, a total of 43% of related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Out of the 12,343 selected JCD entries from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the basis of the unassigned JCD entries, a selection of the files of the tax entities was made at the financial and tax offices, where the declared imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the financial and tax authorities respectively, the implementation of the reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified in the territory of the second state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and SAO SR carried out a joint pilot inspection at the Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma border customs crossing, in which both parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not identify any deficiencies in the record of selected cases of imports and exports of goods made in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions made between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted deficiencies in the record of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="42">The audit of the SAO and SAO of the Slovak Republic focused on imports and exports of spirit and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, as well as other types of goods, in the field of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of a check of the files of tax entities at selected financial and tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of the execution of exports of goods declared on 40 JCDs for a total statistical value of 15,301,093 CZK and the SAO SR for verification of exports for a statistical value of 56,989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among other things, the SAO and SAO SR found the following:</seg>
<seg id="45">- the commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, making it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic,</seg>
<seg id="46">- errors in the entry of data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- there has been no evidence of corresponding imports into the SR for some Czech exports.</seg>
<seg id="48">In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming value added tax deductions;</seg>
<seg id="49">- Tax entities failed to comply with some of the statutory obligations in reporting imports and exports on value added tax returns;</seg>
<seg id="50">- shortcomings have been identified in the work of the financial and/or tax offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the field of value added tax and excise duties, international trade will continue to need attention in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activity of tax administrations in the administration of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">The basis for effective control of excise duties is the control of document circulation, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the value added tax and excise tax situation</seg>
<seg id="55">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax (‘VAT’) was levied by the tax and tax authorities on taxable transactions effected within the country and by the customs authorities on importation of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">The revenue from the tax was due to the difference between the tax liability collected and the excess VAT refunded in the case of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="58">The VAT revenue at the customs offices was determined by the amount of tax they collected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, in the tax deductions applied to the financial and tax authorities respectively.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most financial and tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the flagship taxes in terms of state budget revenue, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and approximately 42% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="63">The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT refunds totalled CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">The total VAT collection in SR in 2003 amounted to 83.8 bn Sk.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tax and customs authorities collected 187.0 billion in VAT in 2003, and refunded excess VAT totalled 103.2 billion Sk.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise duties</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise duties (‘SpD’) was carried out by the competent financial and tax authorities and, on importation, by customs authorities of products subject to SpD.</seg>
<seg id="68">The share of SpD in the tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic was about 16% in 2003 and about 19% in SR.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total collection of SpDs collected in the Czech Republic by financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to 85.6 billion CZK and in the Slovak Republic amounted to 38.0 billion CZK.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. Control Action Progress</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation between the SAO and SAO SR took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage, a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was made; in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used in the mutual verification of the implementation of selected trade transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and in the checks carried out on the territory of the two states.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation on parallel VAT and SpD controls was presented at a working meeting of SAO and SAO SR representatives in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, among other things, a selection of commodities was agreed - goods which posed a significant risk in complying with customs and tax legislation: - ethyl alcohol, tariff headings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be made: (a) from unallocated items identified by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic; (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or on a one-off basis in large volumes; (c) on the basis of findings from inspections carried out by selected tax and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of Customs Databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, the mutual attribution mechanism of JCD items registered in the Customs Databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, a proportion of exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the Customs Tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or higher; Ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, of any strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with their ends cut off), cigars (cigarillos) and cigarettes made of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essences);</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus containing reception equipment: For cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception equipment: Other,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">The JCD entries from the Customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic were attributed to each other based on the conformity of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle carrying the cargo, date of crossing the national border, tariff heading, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and graphs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The cross-attribution of individual imports and exports was hampered by, among other things, the fact that trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, an export from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD was declared on the territory of SR for multiple import JCD, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors influencing the success of the attribution were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of another.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial and tax offices respectively.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports/exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, certain tax entities for which data on imports/exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were found in both databases were selected for the verification of the transactions reported on VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot check at Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing for the performance of the pilot inspection was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the CR and SR.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pursuant to a bilateral agreement between the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of control sheets has been introduced at border customs crossing points between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic since 1 June 1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to provide an overview of the movement of means of transport transporting goods of a commercial nature within the customs area and to create the conditions for comparing customs registers with each other.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot inspection was carried out from 8.3.2004 to 26.3.2004 and aimed at examining this system of customs control.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of control sheets at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing:</seg>
<seg id="104">1. Considering the vehicle, issuing a checklist and handing it to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Unloading the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs discussions in the check-in hall of the Policia ČR, Policie SR, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The check-in process was confirmed by each component stamping the control sheet.</seg>
<seg id="108">3) Bringing the vehicle into the physical inspection area.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the control sheet, JCD, or other documents, as appropriate, to the customs officer - check that all prescribed acts and documents have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="110">Execution of physical checks by relevant files.</seg>
<seg id="111">Releasing the vehicle from customs.</seg>
<seg id="112">Posru: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing vehicles were carried out directly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When the goods were imported into SR, the vehicles weighed were carried out by the staff of the authorised legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">The vehicles were then entered into a computerised record.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Control sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="117">The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the Customs Exports Database of the Czech Republic in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the control sample for exports is given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Control sheets and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="120">When exported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the certificates of inspection were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in an electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">Out of 453 JCD entries, the SAO SR tracked 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic, according to data from the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the workers of the Drietoma border customs crossing.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from SR to CR</seg>
<seg id="124">On export from SR to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Out of a total of 339 JCD entries of the selected control sample, the SAO in cooperation with border customs crossing staff, Starý Hrozenkov assigned to 295 JCD entries the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets.</seg>
<seg id="126">The other 44 cases were identified in their records by the border customs checkpoint staff at Drietoma and the export of goods from SR to the Czech Republic was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The SAO and SAO SR audit did not find deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">In the framework of international cooperation, the realisation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from the supporting documents of customs administrations and financial and tax offices in the territory of the second state.</seg>
<seg id="130">The following were verified for selected tax entities:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCD were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic,</seg>
<seg id="132">- the fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the deduction of VAT on importation, the refund of excess VAT and the application of the exemption from VAT on exportation.</seg>
<seg id="133">The verification of the commercial transactions found:</seg>
<seg id="134">1. The SAO of SR requested verification of the implementation of alcohol exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="135">The SAO identified the corresponding imports in the Czech Customs Database at a statistical value of 42,624 CZK. r</seg>
<seg id="136">2. The photographic equipment and accessories import and export company claimed an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in its VAT return for the month of December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="137">In order to check reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) with a statistical value of 1,274,822 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="138">The SAO of SR identified 3 corresponding import JCD (17 items) at a statistical value of 1,724,321 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="139">VAT was paid in the SR to the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="140">3. The company, whose main business was the optical equipment business, applied a total excess VAT deduction in 2002 that was 4,1,36,000 CZK higher than the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="141">To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected the export JCD (32 items) at a statistical value of 7,154,124 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="142">The SAO SR found that this JCD corresponds to an import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9,653,827 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="143">VAT was paid in the SR to the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="144">4. The company involved in, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, did not report any exports of goods in the 2002 and 2003 VAT returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports totalled 3,439,888 CZK in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="146">Based on these facts, the SAO selected for verification 5 export JCD (5 items) for a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO of SR identified 5 corresponding import JCD (5 items) at a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="148">The audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic at the competent tax office showed that the declared imports were carried out and VAT paid.</seg>
<seg id="149">5. The company, whose business included the purchase of goods for resale, manufacture, installation and repair of electrical machinery and apparatus, declared exports of goods worth CZK 12,966,706 in VAT returns in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 the total value of exports was 14,474,381 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="151">The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) for a total statistical value of 2,975,122 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO SR identified 13 JCD (50 items) in the SR Customs Database, with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="153">The SR Customs Database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCD (9 items) totalling a statistical value of 399,776 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="154">The relevant tax office in SR verified these imports with the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer into SR, commented in the minutes of the local investigation that it had not carried out the imports declared on the Czech export JCD.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO of SR therefore asked the local competent tax office to carry out a VAT and corporation tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="157">6. A company involved in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers worth CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and CZK 12,228,545 in 2003, according to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">In its VAT returns, the company reported no exports in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected for verification 5 export JCD (5 items) totalling a statistical value of 2,471,598 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="160">For 4 export JCD (4 items) in a total statistical value of 2,246,860 CZK, the SAO SR identified 7 JCD (7 items) in a statistical value of 2,919,514 Sk in the Customs Database SR.</seg>
<seg id="161">A corresponding import could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) in statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7. The software delivery company did not report goods exports in its 2002 and 2003 VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports in 2002 and 2003 totalled 1,630,198 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected 9 JCD (9 items) for verification in SR, with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the Customs Database SR, the SAO identified 8 JCD (8 items) in statistical value 915 601 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="166">The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of £68,286 could not be attributed to the corresponding import in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In those cases, it was not possible to identify in the SR customs database the corresponding imports to 6 JCD with a statistical value of 692,800 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- 2 export JCD from the CR Customs Database at a statistical value of 293,024 CZK, the SR Customs Database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD (see paragraphs 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error rate in the entry of data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some of the registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="171">It can therefore not be established with certainty that those exports did not take place.</seg>
<seg id="172">- 4 export JCDs from the Customs database of the Czech Republic were not shown to have imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic at a statistical value of 399,776 CZK (see point 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of the fictitious export of the goods for the purpose of improperly claiming the VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the control of selected financial and tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Check pattern</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of taxable persons in respect of imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between financial and customs authorities, the files of taxable persons have been selected at the audited financial and tax offices, according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">(a) the VAT deductions applied on importation; (b) the excess VAT deductions applied; (c) the right to a refund of SpD; (d) the VAT exemption applied on exportation;</seg>
<seg id="179">3. tax entities that have been subject to a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="180">The sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Checking findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Inspection of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused on the audited financial authorities in particular on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the process of the tax authorities in verifying the accuracy of the VAT declared,</seg>
<seg id="186">- the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- Comparing data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the tariff classification of goods or services, or comparing data on JCD and accompanying invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- Comparing data from VAT returns on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- how to verify entitlement to VAT exemption when exporting goods or services abroad;</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax offices contained only records of those imports and exports in respect of which the taxpayer was obliged to enter the import or export on a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">At the audited tax offices, the files of the tax entities were examined, which reported imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 in 2002 and 2003 in the tax returns, with corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052,000.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the files of tax entities reporting exports worth a total of CZK 47,323,111 in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were checked.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003, the tax subjects who were examined for imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT of CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.</seg>
<seg id="195">The detected differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the Customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items that were missing from the CR Customs Database were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the CR,</seg>
<seg id="197">- the JCD items that were missing from the tax authorities' database were verified as not being cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items where different values were found between the Customs database of the Czech Republic and the Financial Offices database, the relevant JCD was requested from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form including the accompanying invoices.</seg>
<seg id="199">The examination revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total value of VAT of 3,622,000 CZK and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of 9,359,000 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences found</seg>
<seg id="201">A comparison of the JCD database at the tax offices and the accumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for a selected sample of tax subjects revealed the following differences:</seg>
<seg id="202">The differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time lag between the realisation of the imports and the exercise of the right to deduct the VAT charged on the importation of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The taxpayer could exercise the right to deduct on importation of the goods within three years of the end of the tax year in which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary importation scheme, within three years of the end of the tax year in which the scheme came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time lag between the export performance and the time when the taxpayer received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The taxable person was required to enter the details of the exports effected, exempt from the obligation to apply output tax, in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax year in which the goods left the country, if he also had the tax document that was JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to comply with the obligations of taxable persons when reporting imports and exports on VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, the taxpayer did not enter the correct import and export details in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to filed VAT returns, it was made more difficult for tax authorities to control the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the period under scrutiny, import or export duties and VAT were repaid or remitted as a result of decisions taken by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="212">The taxpayer was required by law to reduce the previously claimed right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office, in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT from customs offices to tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with significant delays, and only from some customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited IRS did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data needed to check that the legal obligation on tax subjects was fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, customs refunded VAT of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 of more than CZK 398 million.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the inspection pointed to persistent weaknesses in the activities of the tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the failure of some of the obligations of the payers filing VAT returns and SpD.</seg>
<seg id="219">Shortcomings in VAT and SpD management were identified in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">(a) on the cancellation of VAT registrations, the taxable person's obligation to pay VAT on the business property registered or to be registered on the date of the cancellation of the registration in respect of which the taxable person has deducted VAT has been verified only in isolated cases;</seg>
<seg id="221">(b) the tax authorities have not consistently exercised the option to carry out a tax audit or a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">This has in some cases led to inadequate verification of the legitimacy of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">(c) official records and minutes of oral proceedings did not contain all the necessary particulars proving that the excess VAT claimed was justified;</seg>
<seg id="224">(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. SR control findings</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Inspection of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample, the SAO audited or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the submitted tax returns and refund claims with the selected tax entities, the SAO of SR requested the tax office to secure the relevant JCDs showing import and export, invoices and proof of payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO SR checked whether the submitted JCD was registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the decisive facts and legal conditions in the application of the deduction of input tax on imports, in the refund of excess VAT, in the application of the exemption from export tax and in the refund of SpD.</seg>
<seg id="230">The SAO SR at 10 audited tax offices verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the SAR and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the number of JCD items and the sum of statistical values shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports were checked at a statistical value of 856.2 M. Sk, representing 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to the SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked for a total statistical value of 176 million units, representing 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the SR to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white tech, packaging and software) from EU states to SR were checked for a total statistical value of 532.8 M. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO SR's audit of tax offices found discrepancies between the data registered in the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax subjects (natural persons) declared in their tax returns imports of goods totalling 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the instigation of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, tax subjects failed to prove to the Tax Office the validity of the application of input tax by the relevant documents of the realisation of the imports and the payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- the tax entity (s.r.o.) declared in its tax return for the January 2003 tax year the taxable transaction received in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods in the value of 18 006 041 Sk, and claimed an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VAT returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of 59 161 535 Sk, which arose in January 2003, was not compensated during the whole of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above cases, the SAO requested the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excess VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s.r.o.) for the tax year January to June 2002 declared exports of goods worth a total of 87,199 Sk in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="242">A verification in the SR customs database revealed that the taxpayer had exported a statistical value of 296 747 Sk. during that period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Tax Office carried out multiple local investigations at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's manager (a UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the rented premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the audit of the SAO, the tax administration filed a report to the law enforcement authorities on the suspicion of a crime of non-payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO finds that the biggest problems in the administration and control of VAT and SpD were mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- non-use of the option to carry out a VAT tax check on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases where a high value of excess VAT is applied;</seg>
<seg id="247">- Tax control protocols did not include an inventory of the documents checked</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- Insufficient verification of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns;</seg>
<seg id="250">- the lengthy procedure for tax administrations to make decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, even with the consequence of forfeiting the right to impose penalties;</seg>
<seg id="251">- Failure to comply with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals;</seg>
<seg id="252">- non-recovery of VAT arrears within the VAT excess refund deadline;</seg>
<seg id="253">- underutilisation of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">Based on the audit of the observed shortcomings, the SAO of the Slovak Republic asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a VAT tax audit focusing on the legitimacy of the claimed excess VAT deductions of 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the weaknesses identified, the implementation of which will be monitored and checked by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions made between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted deficiencies in the record of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, the inspections resulted in the detection of persistent deficiencies in the compliance of VAT payers and SpD, in the activity of the financial and tax authorities respectively, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="259">The lessons learned also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic under the tax information system. In the SR, there is no similar system for the transmission of information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT administration and SpD was not the same, given the different legislation and conditions in the territory of the two States.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained with the Czech Customs Administration and from documents available at audited tax offices. The SAO of the Slovak Republic verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="263">Parallel VAT and SpD controls carried out assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the run-up to accession to the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further enhanced in monitoring the activities of financial and tax authorities in the context of the adoption of the new VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be made by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are required to enter the data from the recapitulative statements into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) system, to which tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union have access.</seg>
<seg id="268">The financial or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare this data with the data contained in the submitted VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is further used to verify the validity of VAT registration number of persons, verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied on the supply of goods to another Member State and check the proper taxation of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these control actions will confront the outputs of the control actions being prepared, which will inter alia focus on examining the VIES system to prevent tax evasion in so-called 'intra-Community supplies'.</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budgetary revenue, the need to focus control activities primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion on indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="2">State assets and funds intended to safeguard the activities of the Ministry of the Interior's Refugee Facilities Administration</seg>
<seg id="3">Control action No 04/23 "State property and funds intended to safeguard the activities of the Ministry of the Interior's Administration of Refugee Facilities"</seg>
<seg id="4">Control action No 15/2004 ‘Control of hospodárenia with staff assets and funds intended to provide asylum and temporary sanctuary cudzincom in SR’</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">The migration of the population is one of the phenomena that are global in nature and have become an integral part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is mainly due to the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last place of residence from persecution, in particular for reasons of race, religion, nationality, politics, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to gain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Foreigners are also a large group, driven by unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, both of which the governments of the signatory countries have pledged to apply in their foreign-policy orientations, has already established specific principles for helping refugees.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue after the split in 1993 by continuing to implement adopted international documents, and their binding nature under national legislation was confirmed by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic were focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are included in the joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the "Control Cooperation Treaty" (the "Treaty") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">The two Parties have undertaken in the Treaty to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the State of the other Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences of this for the area of population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information within the scope set out in the Treaty and the drawing up of a joint final report on the outcome of controls.</seg>
<seg id="20">The first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4 to 7.4.2004, set out identical sets of controlled issues and control procedures in the preparation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6 to 30.6.2004, the common points for the control action programme were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the third joint meeting, which took place during the audit event from 8.11 to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience on ongoing inspections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The modalities of the outputs from the controls have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was drawn up on 14.2 to 17.2.2005 at the last joint meeting, has been provisionally determined.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, inspectors of the Defence and Security Department and selected territorial unions carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited persons were the Ministry of the Interior (MV) and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (SUZ).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, the section of defence, vnútra and štátnych úradov was inspected.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migračný úrad Ministerstva vnútra SR (Ministry of Interior).</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistics for a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Review of control results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Assessment of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of the checks carried out in parallel were: - the asylum process, - the asylum facilities, - the management of the State's funds and assets, - the internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of lessons learned between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajHigher Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange allowed for a more thorough evaluation of the submissions, an analysis of the causes of the identified differences in the safeguarding of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">This made it possible to focus on the critical issues affecting the operation of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ultimately, this had a positive effect on the quality of the control work carried out.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union (EU) documents has been the subject of European Commission evaluation reports on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">Legislation in this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants is on a steadily growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants occurring in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, within the meaning of international agreements, provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="44">Both countries' national budgets allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the national budget of the two countries is influenced in particular by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or non-granting of asylum, as well as the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some benefits collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="48">Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, health care and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and the applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting enjoyment.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, as well as integration centres in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost per stay day depends on the occupancy and amenities of the centre and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is projected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, an increasing number of whom are expected to continue to apply the Dublin Convention in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on service security. The crucial expenditure under this heading was expenditure on accommodation and catering for applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service for the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant proportion of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budget measures addressing legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services, and expenditure on security services have all contributed decisively to current spending.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the financial and asset management of the State.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were particularly shortcomings in the use of State budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the Finance Act, when current expenditure covered actions having the character of a technical valuation of fixed tangible assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Accounting Act on Inventories and on Non-Compliance with the Chart of Accounts was also breached.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of the state's property when it was left to be used by another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data breached the Land Registry Act and breached the Waste Act by leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to handle the waste.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, deficiencies were found in the Slovak Republic in the provision of unduly large advances for electricity and natural gas collection, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of the state's assets when its record was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the general binding legislation in force governing the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">There were no deficiencies in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some shortcomings identified, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic are positive about the process of SUZ and the Ministry in securing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Building on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky note that, despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the inspection were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the relevant organisational units of the state on both the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the inspection is used in other joint control actions within the international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the subsequent New York Protocol of 1967).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No 498/1990 Coll., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic, Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and Amending Act No 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended a total of five times (Act No 2/2002 Coll., Act No 217/2002 Coll., Act No 320/2002 Coll., Act No 519/2002 Coll. and Act No 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">There are currently two other amendments to Act No 325/1999 on Asylum in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of law 325/1999 on asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and documents on asylum were political documents in their binding nature.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already, as part of the adoption of this law, there was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to 1st pillar, when asylum law became part of Community law from 1.5.1999 under the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has created the need to create appropriate legislation as well, i.e. to create legal instruments in an appropriate binding legal order.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community Asylum Regulations were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and their transposition period at the time of the Supreme Audit Office's inspection, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">Once implemented in the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it has implemented the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status, or who have been granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic, was laid down, with effect from 1 January 1996, by the National Council of the Slovak Republic Act No 283/1995 Z. z., on utechencoch.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No 480/2002 Z. z ‘ on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws, incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">Following two amendments to Act No 480/2002 Z z., on asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements include, for example, making it compulsory for asylum seekers to attend a Slovak language foundation course during their stay at the integration centre, appointing a guardian to the courts for non-legal aliens if they are staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship in certain circumstances, as set out in an amendment to the law.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU law in the area of migration and asylum process has been assessed in the European Commission's regular reports on the preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report pointed out that the Ministry's staffing capacity was inadequate, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, matters relating to refugees have come under the jurisdiction of the MoI since 1990.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1.1.1996, the MoI established an organisational arm of the state SUZ. This was due to the separation of the state administration's performance in the field of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the MoI, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services for the MV to participants in asylum and asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry carries out crucial tasks in the field of asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process, to the extent defined by specific regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks include issues related to deciding on asylum applications by aliens at stage I of the administrative procedure and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">It also prepares concepts for the state's migration policy.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the area of asylum system development in the Slovak Republic over the past years have been significantly influenced by cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A particular benefit was his financial participation in the refurbishment of the Asylum Housing Fund.</seg>
<seg id="100">UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Developments in the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The trend in the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">A total of 394 cases were granted asylum in the period under scrutiny, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">A total of 22,731 cases were not granted asylum during the period under review and 22,636 cases were discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties on 1.1 includes both those to whom the decision has not yet been issued and those to whom the decision has not been communicated.</seg>
<seg id="108">Also included are those who have been excused from missing the deadline for lodging an appeal, or who have had a previous decision revoked and not yet issued a new one.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is a steadily increasing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, the figure was 10,358 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8,131 registered, an increase of 423% on 2000, when 1,556 applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of asylum procedures in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are presented in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylum applications were granted during the period under scrutiny and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in any given year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">Asylum procedures were discontinued in a total of 23,088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">The bulk of applicants, by staying away from the asylum facility without a permit, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">More than 82% of the total number of registered applicants in 2002 and more than 94% in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of an applicant's stay in an asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The Ministry's findings also show that the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in the documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases, the asylum system is used for purpose by the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="121">A request for asylum based on economic grounds, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not grounds for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such a request should be assessed as manifestly unfounded under the provisions of Article 12(1)(a) of Act No 480/2002 on Asylum, and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">There are still no internationally recognised principles for identifying economic migrants that distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and that allow the asylum process to be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration, and the destination countries of migration have been, and remain, Western European states.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple purpose-built asylum applications from being lodged in more than one EU country.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants return to the country of first registration after a positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the external border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may in the next period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions to stay in the Slovak Republic until a decision is taken on whether or not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Drawing on funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and resulting national legislative adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="131">Both countries' national budgets allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure up to the final decision on granting asylum, as well as their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for claimants, such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some doses selected are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, during the audited period, meals were 58 CZK per person per day, pocket money was 12 CZK per person per day and 6 CZK per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per residence day was on average 351 CZK in 2001, 383 CZK in 2002 and 345 CZK in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to the allowance, asylum seekers housed in residential centres with self-contained cooking and applicants housed in private out of asylum facilities may be granted a subsistence allowance up to the minimum.</seg>
<seg id="138">Law 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, provides, inter alia, in Paragraph 84, for municipalities to be entitled to a contribution towards the costs incurred in connection with an asylum facility on its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the allowance was set each year by Government resolutions and during the audited period was CZK 7 per person per day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are granted an allowance to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was £120 per pupil per month during the audited period, on condition that in that month the person attended the school for a minimum of 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period, the diet was 70 Sk per person per day, the allowance was 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per residence day averaged 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">The municipalities in whose territory the asylum facility is located are granted a contribution towards the partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility, in accordance with Act No 480/2002 Z. z., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="145">Municipalities have so far made only partial use of the possibility to apply for the allowance, which is set at 1 500 Sk per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries sets a 90-day time limit for issuing asylum decisions from the start of asylum proceedings, while allowing for an extension of that time limit in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is the lodging of appeals against decisions not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions were issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the asylum application (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated between 2001 and 2003 were finally decided within one year of their start.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to the Ministry's data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum benefit from the statutory possibility of extending the deadline by appealing to the court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and the court proceedings had not been completed at the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="154">Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint working places of the Ministry and the Department of Border and Cudzinecke Policie of the Police Board in reception centres in Adama-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and in Liptovský Vlachoch, which was approached at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This envisages simplifying procedures and shortening procedural deadlines between the two arms of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to participants in the asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="158">Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, healthcare, pocket money and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and the applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing the state's assets in the areas of the reception centre of Vyšní Lhoty, the reception and residence centre of Red Újezd, the residential centres of Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and the premises of the integration asylum centres of Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brno.</seg>
<seg id="162">In early 2002, a reception centre was set up in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seči, Bruntále, Zbýšov and Kashava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Article 80(3) of the Asylum Act No 325/1999 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of reception centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of residential centres is 1 977 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities which asylum seekers may not leave until they have completed the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception procedures specified in Act No 325/1999 on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violation of the obligation to stay at the reception centre is classed as a misdemeanour.</seg>
<seg id="167">Accommodation centres to which asylum seekers come from reception centres are used to accommodate asylum seekers until a decision on their application to be granted or not granted asylum has become final.</seg>
<seg id="168">Provided that certain conditions are met, asylum seekers are allowed to leave or stay in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, meals, other services and pocket money in the reception and reception centres in which they are reported to be staying, provided that they have tolerated the actions necessary to establish their financial and financial circumstances, and such ratios are such that even partial reimbursement for those services cannot be fairly claimed from them.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for the temporary accommodation of people who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are housed in the centre under an accommodation contract, which is generally concluded for 6 months, with the possibility of extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or secured by themselves under a state integration programme.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients pay all accommodation costs and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons granted refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">To compare asylum facilities, it was chosen as the most meaningful indicator of the cost per physical day of residence.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of people who have actually been provided with the services provided by the asylum facility each day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, establishments operated by SUZs are designated as their own and those operated by legal persons under Section 80 of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contracted.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one day's stay in its own SUZ-operated asylum facility is decreasing as these facilities become more populated. This is because the fixed costs of running the premises are allocated to more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionately as the number increases.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, the asylum facilities themselves housed applicants in crisis capacity.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, extra accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to deal with the capacity crisis in asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was provided through the lease of 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">Spending per applicant per residence day was then lower in those years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, long-term maintenance of high levels of fulfillment of these facilities is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated demand for the need for increased accommodation should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out certain repairs, maintenance and investments with full accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum facilities operated contractually allows for the adoption of operational solutions on the capacity of asylum facilities where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Ministry has in its administration the Adamov-Gbely reception centres, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the Brezová residential centre under Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 places and the residential centre 100 places.</seg>
<seg id="192">A growing number of asylum seekers were dealt with by the Ministry by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava, with flexible available capacity ranging from 250 to 940 places.</seg>
<seg id="193">Under the lease agreement, the leaseholder also provides services connected with the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the MO addressed its own staff shortages.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160.</seg>
<seg id="196">Reception centres averaged between 57% and 62% during the audited period; residential centres averaged between 33% and 50%.</seg>
<seg id="197">Occupancy varied by season and was highest in the final months of the year, when many more asylum seekers applied compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Further increases of accommodation capacity of about 450 places will be possible after reconstruction of the centres in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of places will increase by a further 550 people following the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Figures for the cost of operating asylum facilities are given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity providing premises and running facilities, including related activities, is one of the options to safeguard, at reasonable cost, the tasks arising from the asylum seekers' stay in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of state funds and assets</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Economic analysis</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, the approved budgeted expenditure of SUZs was increased by 13 budget measures of CZK 103,077,000 in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of this, 89 979,000 CZK (87.29%) were earmarked funds. The bulk was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis ($44,538,000) and to provide health care to asylum seekers ($38,870,000).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, SUZ expenditure was increased by 20 budget measures by CZK 88,362,000.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of this, 62,282,000 CZK (70.48%) were dedicated funds, the bulk of which (53,200 CZK) was for health care provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, SUZ expenditure was increased by 14 budget measures totalling CZK 88,078,000.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of this, CZK 82,000,000 (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 to deal with the influx of Chechen refugees, and CZK 7,000,000 for a humanitarian evacuation programme for disabled residents of the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the execution of selected SUZ expenditure during the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the overview above that the highest proportion of expenditure was spent on service provision.</seg>
<seg id="214">Spending on purchasing services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total spending.</seg>
<seg id="215">Excruciating expenses under this heading were expenses for housing and catering applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenses for medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service to guard the various asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Salary, work-related payments and insurance premiums accounted for a significant proportion of SUZ's total expenditure (23.99% - 24.97%).</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, purchases of materials accounted for a significant share of SUZs' total expenditure (around 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest proportion of such expenditure (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry's budget management of securing migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate demands linked to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">The budget proposal and breakdown in the expenditure section was characterised, in particular in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the IAC's requests, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs of their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, above all, in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The budget chapter administrator tackled the disproportion during the year with multiple budget measures, increasing the current spending limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by as much as 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the execution of selected expenses of the Ministry during the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51%, and expenditure on materials and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure, contributed decisively to current spending.</seg>
<seg id="223">Spending on security services accounted for more than 10% and from 3.92% to 7.20% on groceries.</seg>
<seg id="224">Spending on accommodation and catering services accounted for a further significant proportion, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">The relatively low share, ranging from 1.03% to 6.25%, was capital spending.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Shortcomings identified</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the management of the state's funds and assets.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were deficiencies in particular in the following areas: (b) breach of the Accounting Act in the field of inventories and failure to comply with the indicative chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of the state's property, where it was left to be used by another person without a proper contract; Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to Land Registry data breached the Land Registry Act; Leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to handle the waste has infringed the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, deficiencies in the provision of unduly high advances for electricity and natural gas collection, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of the state's assets were found in the Slovak Republic when its record was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposing of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal Control System</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, was introduced at the SUZ on 1 July 2002, setting out the competencies of the individual employees responsible for carrying out the preliminary, intermediate and follow-up checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal auditor of SUZ was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Each year the SUZ is issued a plan of financial, social and operational technical checks aimed at comprehensively verifying the management of the state's funds and assets in the various asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">There were 42 management checks in 2002 and 54 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in respect of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations is ensured by the Minister's Office of Control.</seg>
<seg id="237">During the audited period, no check was made on the performance of tasks in the asylum sector.</seg>
<seg id="238">The Ministry's internal control system is mainly aimed at carrying out preliminary and ongoing financial control according to Act No 502/2001 on financial control and internal audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of financial control is also governed by the internal rules of the director of the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="240">The material focus of the audit activity as part of the management of the different departments was set out in the annual plan of the IA.</seg>
<seg id="241">The directors of the union have been designated as responsible for exercising control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the submitted written documentation, no deficiencies were identified.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the Decree No 28 of 23 April 2004 of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Interior has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Law on Complaints.</seg>
<seg id="244">The organizational security of this task will need to be completed in the near term.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint Report on Parallel Checks on Highway Construction Expenditure Prague – Dresden</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be hard to imagine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating the conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and costs is an important task for government.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a very demanding task, both organisational and technical and financial.</seg>
<seg id="7">Europe's efforts at sustainable mobility are often and hard to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Constructions of transport infrastructure, even with the necessary environmental measures, are financially challenging.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considerable government procedures and decisions in the preparation and acquisition of transport structures can bring significant savings in public financial resources that can be used in other ways for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the roles of the audit institutions is to actively seek deficiencies that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on transport infrastructure construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit institutions should not only draw the attention of the state administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) carried out parallel checks on expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (the D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The highways are connected by a border bridge that is co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough check of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the level of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract in 2000 for the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eventually, according to the construction process, the completion date was scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award procedure, the Directorate of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the RMD) made errors which led to an extension of the competition period and a reduction of the construction time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint inspection work, bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 motorways were compared on a per square metre basis for the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to delays in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, the inspectors found that tunnel prices on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and the SAO now have a database on the prices of bridges and tunnels, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, both monitoring institutions recommend: standardisation of bridge structures and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only when pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">Her team spirit and informality were among the main signs of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel inspection, the controllers shared their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report reports on the progress and results of the parallel checks of funds spent on the construction of the motorway linking Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The controls were focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel inspections were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel controls took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) on the frontier section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million of European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to the parallel inspection carried out with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden - central and southern parts of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">Highway D 8 runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">Highway A-17 runs from the Czech Republic/Germany border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">Border sections of both motorways were under construction at the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections became operational on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is thus completed as far as Dresden, while on the Czech side of highway D 8 it is not completed, as section 0805, covering 16.4 km through the Czech Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosicemi, is still in the preparation phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of České středohoří.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, there should be 22,940 vehicles per day on the cross-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic to link the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 to the common national border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both States are involved in the construction of the bridge, therefore the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel controls carried out by the two control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation of BRH and SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have discussed working closely together to control the construction of the motorway linking Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">The SRN is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction rests with the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds had been used cost-effectively in relation to the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels at D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to ascertain the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the agreement on coordinated control of the D 8/A 17 motorway was signed by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The joint working meetings of the BRH auditors and the SAO took place over the whole of 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The meetings addressed current issues and challenges, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The continuous exchange of information was a major sign of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH did most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and tendering procedures, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for government control differ in the way control actions are closed in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two supreme audit institutions drew their own control conclusions on their findings, obtained during their inspections.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved through parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Border bridge construction</seg>
<seg id="73">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in a 2000 contract on the completion date of the construction of the border bridge, as far as possible, in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two sides then agreed to postpone this date until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The SRN is financially involved in building the bridge out of 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a pre-stressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed to a bonded steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of twin pillars from seven to five and the subsequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, comparative calculations carried out by the RMD indicated that the braced steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">They stated that the new fused steel-concrete structure would be only 397m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it's 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It has not prepared contract documentation that adequately describes the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for the comparison of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error resulted in the bid evaluation and evaluation panel and the Director-General evaluating the bids in a subjective and problematic manner.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful tenderer contested the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">Subsequent investigations by the Competition Authority led to the contract for the construction contract being signed later than initially calculated.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, following the evaluation of the bids, was wasted and the time allocated to construction was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in less time, but at a substantial cost increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The process offered included the double installation of a bridge top, a change in the structure of the pillars and the establishment and fitting-out of mounting spaces.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was unable to procure the type of steel originally proposed by the required deadline.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a cost of some €4 million more, which had to be paid in full by the RMD – allowed a reduction in the time taken to implement anti-corrosion protection, which in turn enabled the overall construction time of the border bridge to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in financing.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced time allocated to construction work led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">At present, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, not taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices</seg>
<seg id="98">The two supreme audit institutions carried out an analysis of the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges that were priced too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis relied on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the SRN motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two supreme audit institutions have established the following principles for comparing bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge, excluding value added tax (VAT rates vary and are subject to change in the Czech Republic and SNR); do not take into account prices for the special foundations of the bridge; convert prices in CZK into € at the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">Both D 8 and A 17 have bridges of different designs (steel-concrete, pre-stressed reinforced concrete, joined-together steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction was concrete bridges on both sides of the boundary (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis concentrated mainly on this group of bridges, as the size of the population allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">Checks found that prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price's dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see charts below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges at A 17 and four at D 8 have been identified and are priced significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">A method to detect atypical values in a set of numbers was used to locate these bridges, as well as a regression analysis taking into account the bridge price's dependence on its size (for determining atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upwards).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information about the atypically high price of those bridges should only be seen as an indication of which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each case identified should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative action, or environmental requirements or some other plausible reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the bridge price on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices for Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech construction sector compared to the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges at D 8 are higher than at A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two possible causes for this have been identified during the joint negotiations:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">There is more variability in bridge designs in the CR than in the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is taken at the time when the RMD submits an application for a territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">Although the RMD selects bridge types from several variants at this time, economy plays a minor role in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction works market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled ocelobeton bridge at D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, it was found that tunnel prices on the D 8 are twice as high as tunnels in the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with the tunnels in the SRN showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the tunnel construction industry in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden-Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">A separate CR was created in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the concept of development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the national border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be acquired before the border section No 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 motorway under programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In programme No 327 220 ‘Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/SRN” set two objectives for the construction of the D 8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – a national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the framework of the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin-Istanbul - an international objective.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the commissioning date.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">There is no final decision on the claims.</seg>
<seg id="152">It can therefore not be excluded that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed several years later than indicated in the documentation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the date of completion of section 0805 until 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the cross-border section has not achieved the national objective of improving the link between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD made an estimate of capital expenditure for the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains in 1999-2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate in these capital expenditure included investment costs is about €639 million combined for both Sections Nos 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Economic Assessment Results (EIRR = Internal Rate of Yield)</seg>
<seg id="158">All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All motorways and expressways under consideration open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25,000 vehicles a day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">An economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.</seg>
<seg id="165">However, at the time of the inspection, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the aforementioned EIRRs.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections, net of VAT, as at 31.12.2005, was €897 million, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the cost level used in the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more expensive route, which would affect the aforementioned threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis has shown that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at a traffic intensity of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Central Highlands calculates a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="171">With the higher load of commuter routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which was not foreseen in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above mentioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the D 8 border section should have achieved will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 motorway also involved similar cost overruns to those of the two sections on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the 1992 Federal Road Development Plan for Long-haul Transport, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany projected a cost of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting expense-income ratio was then 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have risen sharply to about €670 million, and the cost-benefit ratio has more than halved.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to the parallel inspection carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, BRH found that the relevant State Approval Authority had required an off-road tunnel for Section A 17, third section, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the course of the inspection, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German road building administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">This resulted in savings that amounted to around €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">Assessing the first section of A 17, BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Authority did not investigate the conditions of the bedrock in the Dölzschen rocks because the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine had struck the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks were more weathered inside than anticipated during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">Costly measures such as anchoring, injections and stone-falling protective nets, which cost about €3.3 million, therefore had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Road and Motorway Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other extraordinary operations, such as safety measures in the rocks of Dölzschen, but also of measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to project overruns (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to some €10.7 million, which was not matched by any value added.</seg>
<seg id="191">Based on the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction works.</seg>
<seg id="192">In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Directorates of Roads and Highways the necessary incentive to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the purpose of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and progress of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">The two supreme audit institutions have built a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future inspections can rely.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and route of the D 8 motorway do not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use for further inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects implemented under the Cross-Border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The evolving community of the people of Europe is a driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let this community provide the opening word on this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often relics of darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover sea basins, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programmes are bilateral, but some involve more than two neighbouring countries. "</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last for seven years and receive a total of EUR 5.7 billion from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The programmes include the following activities: repairing and reconstructing cross-border roads, cycling paths and bridges, investing in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood prevention measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of joint services for the local population, advice on employment issues, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects that are based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funding is provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border work together in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four features: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">Key attributes of the partnership include: joint choice of lead partner, joint project preparation and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, taking overall responsibility for project implementation by the lead partner, overall support payments being accepted by the lead partner and transferred to the respective project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out on the territory of the districts and voivodships adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic-Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS ČR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">€258,187,467 has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total included a contribution from European funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be spent by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the uptake of EU funds from the Cross-Border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic-Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement on cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013, following previous mutual meetings at the meeting of the heads of supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in Lovasberény, Hungary, in September 2012.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to check that the implementation of the operational programme was carried out in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, that the management and control system was functioning reliably, that the objectives of the operational programme were being achieved and that the projects selected were being implemented in accordance with the conditions laid down for the aid granted.</seg>
<seg id="26">This co-operation took the form of a parallel control, in which the supervisory authorities, on the basis of their legal mandate, independently examined topics the content of which had been jointly discussed beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit carried out also included elements of a performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The checks carried out resulted in audit findings published in the usual way by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">This joint report is based on the two control conclusions set out in the Annex.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected common control sample included six projects (Annex 1) which fall within the support area 1.1 — Strengthening transport accessibility and the support area 2.2 — Promoting tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the uptake of funds from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all projects implemented under the entire OPPS ČR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to the control of a common sample of six projects, the SAO audited a further 13 projects and NIK audited two others (all from support areas 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to beneficiaries of the ERDF, which were audited by the SAO and NIK, totalled €25,362,174 (SAO) and €8,450,784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited volume represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries from aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both inspections carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of materiality.</seg>
<seg id="40">Implementation of OPPS ČR–POL, covering the operation of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The auditees who were part of the management and control system took steps to limit the risk of misuse of funds and under-use of ERDF funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Proof of the effectiveness of the projects implemented under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the objectives set, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of project implementation.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out a check of the OPPS ČR–POL management and control system implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Local Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry for Local Development POL) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit allowed for the evaluation of the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in relation to the set-up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of the progress made, the evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the absorption of programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, the control activities of the managing authority, the set-up of the performance of activities and outputs from the audits of the entrusted body and the system for reporting and monitoring irregularities and compliance with it, while the coordination of the OPL was examined.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and establishment of control plans at the site of project execution were examined and evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The examination of the control system included a review of the administrative and on-the-spot checks that allowed the approval of e.g. supplies of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, while the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant shortcomings were found by the SAO audit in the publication of correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies granted.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of project evaluation and approval, a risk of non-transparency of the process has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other weaknesses were found in the setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the reporting system for irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities identified by NIK, which related to the operation of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules, were not assessed as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities only had an impact on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified discrepancies, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and targets set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all the projects audited, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are in line with the outcome of the Social Assessment of Project Implementation survey described below.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect that the SAO and NIK paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of an objective evaluation of the performance of the anticipated results of individual projects, taking into account both the objectives of the individual projects and the objectives of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On initiative The Supreme Audit Chamber conducted an opinion poll conducted in the summer of 2013 at the site of the implementation of projects selected for the common control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both to the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and to the Czech public in relation to the part of the project carried out in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey covered in particular the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of projects including investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents per project is given in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">An assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social rating of the projects was good, reaching 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), meaning that project results were viewed positively by the majority of respondents both in terms of objectives and other parameters mentioned in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments in improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and re-establishing contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of the participants in the panel discussions (focus groups) carried out as part of NIK's control on the Polish side, who pointed to the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and delivery of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">The beneficiaries were checked for the consistency of the substantive and time execution of the project with the project application schedule and content, the fulfilment of the set objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of mandatory monitoring indicators, the management of changes in the projects, the handling of potential project revenues, the fulfilment of the obligation to keep a separate accounting record of project transactions, compliance with the ban on project funding from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its terms and conditions, the fulfilment of mandatory publicity relating in particular to the dissemination of the sources of EU project funding, compliance with the conditions for eligibility of project expenditure, the selection of contractors and the verification of deliverables delivered.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the deficiencies qualified by the SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found to be €85,094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, that amount did not exceed the established level of materiality relating to the total audited volume of funds for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the irregularities found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, commitments under the terms of the aid were duly met by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds intended for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">However, seven of the eight beneficiaries audited by NIK were found to be irregular in the implementation of substantive and financial obligations.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, but did not affect the choice of contractor or the delivery of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of all projects audited by NIK, an irregularity found to relate to non-compliance with reporting obligations may qualify as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which €8 231 funded by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2 098 053 in three of the 19 audited projects (of which €76 863 was funded by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included a failure to deliver the materials and works paid for or an expense for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system in particular with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, efforts must also be made to establish such indicators at both programme and project level that allow more reliable verification of the implementation of the identified impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Comments and recommendations from checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate audit conclusions of the SAO and NIK on the CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICATES</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and Polish languages and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public works procurement and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel audit by Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and Overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private sectors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its regulations, the EU has set limits above which contracting authorities must meet certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts below EU thresholds, the regulation of their award remains the responsibility of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is vulnerable to corruption, with consequent high potential for harm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting authorities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to avoid corruption and unfair favouritism (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - NCA) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to conduct parallel checks in the field of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport structures.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the field of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Controls included awarding contracts below European limits in order to crack down on corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The inspection findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Areas of control and audited institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH assessment is based on blanket inspections of the above-mentioned areas, which were carried out at the German construction administrations in charge of federal transport and land structures between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, motorway works and large-scale building projects were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="20">BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO's assessment is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, federal procurement is mostly carried out by the Land's building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the state institutions for road and rail construction are responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure contracts.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of building, procurement is carried out by entities benefiting from budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at each stage of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation must take into account the differences in procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and sub-statutory standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts .</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are set out in the federal government's so-called procurement manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail, taking into account legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation concerning contracts with a value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law was substantially changed in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up scope for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="35">Essential aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As far as European procurement procedures are concerned, open and narrower procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for competition, negotiated procedures), but these are practically identical to the above-mentioned conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates on a European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and when invited to take part in a contest, a tender may be submitted by any interested party.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved primarily by dividing the total procurement into business-specific lots and dividing into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">The award of contracts divided into these lots gives as many candidates as possible a chance to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested tools for getting good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are more than 330,000 construction companies registered in Germany with 1.9 million employees.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the terms of European procedures must be applied even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is the simplified sub-standard procedure, where the contracting authority can apply less onerous procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a narrower procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total procurement volume of public works by contracting authorities and proportion of each type of procedure in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">CZK 1,138 billion (15%) of which was the share of public contracts that included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities, in addition to those awarded by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of federal road and land construction projects (excluding construction of railways and water structures) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of the federal land works and transport works contracts was as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public calls; 12.7% narrower governance and challenges;</seg>
<seg id="55">6,6 % negotiated procedures and direct awards; 33.2% is the proportion of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118.6 billion CZK in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 it reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedures; 14,3 % restricted management; 9,5 % negotiated procedure; 8,4 % simplified procedures for sub-standard contracts; 2.7% other management.</seg>
<seg id="59">The figures include all supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries targeted a substantial proportion of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption, which must be kept in mind in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open significance. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel checks on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on preventing corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The inspections focused on comparing legislation in the two countries and the EU and on the implementation of land and transport procurement contracts.</seg>
<seg id="64">The following are the key findings:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national laws of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but of the two countries' national procurement rules, which differ in part in both focus and detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the basic requirement that tender documents must meet is to include all the information needed to prepare tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject matter of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, splitting contracts into lots is required where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO's inspections showed that in the Czech Republic considerable public works in the field of roadworks are commissioned without being divided into parts or being divided, but only into very significant parts in volume. This may distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and create the risk of non-serious price negotiations and impermissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">Legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities to award additional works under certain conditions if the need arises after the contract has been concluded (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for correctly determining the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, under the applicable regulations, contracting authorities are free to designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">German procurement and budgetary law enshrines the primacy of open procedures for both European tenures and national ones, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open tender procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it more difficult to collude illegally between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results in terms of value for money are being achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts for which the estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting authorities always launched a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Correct determination of the estimated contract value plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to determine the price of public works objectively, in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, prior information and contract notices need to be published in order to enhance competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">Selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published sufficiently in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Beyond EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should as often as possible rotate candidates who invite participation in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are in part very detailed requirements to prevent the risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited contracting authorities did not follow these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (point 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure during the procurement process that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between these candidates, and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications, must be avoided as far as possible, so as not to restrict competition through unlawful agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited German contracting authorities did not meet this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">Labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (paragraph 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of bids is regulated procedurally in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but have not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities passed on their tenders to third parties for inspection without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">Thus, offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (paragraph 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">For the purposes of legal protection, the participants must be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The tender documentation was not always complete or fully credible for the audited contracting entities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, transparency requirements applied at European level were not always properly respected in the minutes of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some of the weaknesses identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly complied with their reporting obligations (paragraph 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European tender law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts to ensure the free movement of goods and services, and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures for the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), both of which were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general EU procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include the Directive on the Coordination of Public Procurement Procedures in addition includes provisions for construction projects with a total foreseeable value of over €5 million.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions shall affect: the content of the procurement documents; type of procurement procedure used; disclosure of certain information before, during and after proceedings; compliance with the deadline for the receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of candidates is governed by the Remedies Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">There is no legal definition in either country of what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">Corruption is widely understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for its own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is encouraged by those benefiting.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">Total corruption-related damages are estimated to account for 5% of the world's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">That is why preventing corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practice and procedures must be scrutinised, particularly in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption, so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive action and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be an area particularly vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, with particular regard to active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual of recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside of risk analysis: preference for open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete tender documentation.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor procurement for the construction of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total contract value and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed to identify any discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also an option.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were set out by the government in the "Government's Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2012" which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of these measures have been incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the thresholds for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notice by the contracting authority, including the justification for the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in a restricted procedure and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of controls related to subsequent stages of procurement</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender Documentation</seg>
<seg id="150">Tender documents shall contain all information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="151">The documentation shall, in particular, allow for the processing of the offer price.</seg>
<seg id="152">In order to do so, tenderers must not be exposed to risks they could not have anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender dossier shall contain, in particular, specifications, as well as requirements to prove the qualifications of the tenderers and criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must limit competition as little as possible and all interested parties must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">Specifications must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data that create scope for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that specifications should be given generally without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specifications must specify the deliveries and services required and detail the numbers of units of work and deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be indicated by units of work or supply (e.g. in CZK/m or CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">It is permissible to define the work required in terms of functionality only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that specifications must be drawn up completely and unambiguously.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Reimbursements in the form of lump sums or according to time worked should be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the tender dossier must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must allow each bidder to prepare its bid with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender shall not be published until the tender dossier is complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in lots.</seg>
<seg id="176">A procuring entity may divide a procurement into several separate lots if the nature of the subject of such a procurement so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule of dividing works into parts is required, either quantitatively (sub-deliveries) or according to special considerations (specialised parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows SMEs to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of procurement is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, tender documents must contain evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">In doing so, the tenderer should be comprehensively and exhaustively informed of the criteria by which its tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">When the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German law requires excluding from them any information that would assist in identifying the specific firms, architects or designers involved.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining, without the knowledge of the contracting authority, any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents relating to tenders and make them accessible for screening.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the sole point of contact for the construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of major construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional works or modifications to existing works after the initial contract is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="190">Legislation in both countries allows a multi-work contract to be awarded within a certain limit to the same contractor without the need to publish and conduct a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original contract value.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, additional works must be necessary and must be of a specific nature as part of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied to the award of additional works.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may entail the risk of a greater time lag in the execution of the contract and the eventual incorporation of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multi-works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to multiple works, there may be inferiorities in construction, i.e. work that was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, inferiority and multiwork cannot be compensated for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, specifications have referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications included data requiring a specific brand name, e.g. for a public sign resistance system, for preventing water ingress or for anti-noise cladding, although this was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications broken down into items</seg>
<seg id="206">BRH did not detect, in a single case of checking procurement procedures, a non-conformity with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services under the quantity specifications broken down into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, tender documents were fully drawn up before the call for tenders was launched.</seg>
<seg id="209">In various cases, however, documents had to be modified during the procurement process when changes in the items or timing had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, the tender documents included works and supplies whose need was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Division of contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification not to split deliveries into lots has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">BRH did not find any shortcomings in the tender evaluation criteria prior to the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="215">Include Names of Authorized Independent Experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many of the documents mentioned interested authorized experts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Names were included on the front pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">For building projects, these cases were found mainly in tender documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with drawing up the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities indicated that they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to scrutinise tender documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">OWN</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 apartments, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and product brands.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not admit the use of other similar types of products or justify why it required the supply of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">In the case of the construction of a university facility, the tender documents contained references to specific commercial firms and specific product designations.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overview of specifications and sub-specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">In the case of the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documents the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the statement of assessment and established only the enclosure in cubic metres for each building as the unit of measurement.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender specifications for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation due to an extension of the scope of the contract and a change in the technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">In the case of the construction of social objects, the tender documents had defects which forced the creation of multiple works (lack of precise focus, insufficient technical research in the construction, absence of drawings).</seg>
<seg id="232">In the tender documents for the construction of the large library, the interior elements were listed only descriptively, with no specification of quality requirements for the products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of interior fittings was provided by subcontractors who purchased some premium and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and contract award criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award the contract in lots.</seg>
<seg id="236">An analysis of three major roadworks under construction of the road circuit showed that when they were awarded in open procedure in lots (separately after selected objects), savings of up to CZK 790 million could be made from the achieved price of public contracts of CZK 15,508 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, by awarding six building sites as a separate part of the public contract, a saving of EUR 62.5 million could have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">A saving of CZK 287.8 million, i.e. also 25%, could be achieved by awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract.</seg>
<seg id="239">The contracting authority had set qualification criteria in the tender documents for the construction of the roads, limiting the participation of small contractors in the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the tender specifications for an open tender for a contractor for one construction of a motorway, the contracting authority requested, among other things, the contractor's practice of carrying out at least three roadworks with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million each, completed or put into service over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine firms in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing buildings over 700 million CZK in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The open tender for the delivery of another motorway construction covered six separate works for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of works of EUR 12 billion over the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two-thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. €2.5 billion out of €3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of 13.2 billion CZK, there were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential can lead to large cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Multiwork Area</seg>
<seg id="247">The contracting authority, when constructing the road circuit, did not, in two cases, conclude a written contract for the supply of the additional works and did not award the additional works by any of the procedures specified in the Act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of pre-approved multi-work in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million excluding VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million excluding VAT (an increase of 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The reason for the extra work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies of which it was aware at the time of the award of the contract that it needed to complete and validate the construction.</seg>
<seg id="251">For those works and supplies, he concluded amendments to the works contract with the builder with an increase in price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the context of the construction of the Justice Palace, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">Unit prices for additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same contractor.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction cost of building one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is CZK 355.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre of a four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that acquiring a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions relating to procurement documents are almost identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">Specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow interested parties to calculate costs and prepare their bids.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to commission additional works.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are supplemented by additional rules to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for carrying out manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved through the publication of award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">Specification requirements are mostly met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, shortcomings have been identified that could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The current rule in Germany requiring bulky construction projects to be subdivided into sections seems appropriate for fostering a competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without piecing together or dividing into large-scale parts can limit the range of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">The result of the strict requirement on bidder references applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of road works bidders is that public contracts are awarded only to a small number of bidders and thus small and medium-sized companies have no chance of competing.</seg>
<seg id="271">The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixing and other illegal arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="272">The regulatory approaches in the two countries are different when it comes to awarding and paying for additional contracts for additional works or modified works.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the additional works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the 20 % limit is exceeded, additional works must be awarded following a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dividing up the work into parts avoids both the reduction of competition and the consequent ill effects.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of procurement procedure with respect to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By specifying the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential contractors that will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">A procuring entity may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited, or may limit the scope according to specified criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">A European procurement procedure must be conducted for major project works with a value that exceeds or exceeds the limits set by the EU.</seg>
<seg id="284">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must in particular comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the works required reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="288">Where a construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by launching a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below the threshold of €1.0 million ($25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the estimated value of the entire contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or deliberately estimating its cost too low with the intention of avoiding a major obligation to launch a European procurement procedure is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">Choosing the type of governance is very important for preventing corruption, as reducing competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification of the type of procedure chosen is an important part of the tender documentation, particularly in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures as well as for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of procedure are only permitted if the conditions laid down by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of preventing corruption prefer open procedures or a public invitation to take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted ones, are permitted only exceptionally, where the legislation so permits.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exemptions must be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of open procedure preference is intended to ensure that restrictions on competition are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">In estimating the costs of building projects, contracting authorities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of construction, construction units, building parts and sub-construction works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the contract value of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be expanded nationally.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of land-based contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate by the entity financing the project or based on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures for standardisation are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">Under the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of customary prices for standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of a price system to determine the expected price of a contract is determined by a new regulation requiring the subject of the contract to be set out in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly works, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to establish unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport works for inspection, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is designed to price the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the subsequent stages of the preparation of the works.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Tender Selection</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts through an open procedure or a public call for tenders and thus complied with the requirements of budget and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of tenders in the total volume of federal building projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, the share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of in-camera competition was not adequately justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of blanket control, the BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16,000 procedures, that restricted management has a clear disadvantage compared to public management and public challenge, and restricted procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, bidding prices in the restricted procedure and negotiated procedure were 6% to 10% higher than in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Audit Court confirmed the differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="327">Indeed, a study by the Ministry of Construction found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects estimated to have a total contract value of more than €5 million ($125 million), the audited contracting authorities generally prepared procurement plans indicating which works would be awarded in the European tender and which in the national tender.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the tendering plans, the proportion of works commissioned under European rules was always more than 80% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="331">There has not been a case of circumvention of the requirement for European governance in the form of an exorbitantly low cost estimation.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases the minimum proportion for pan-European management has not been reached due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of carrying out the works, some contracting authorities have unlawfully changed the contracting plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not provide any justification for these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of European governance would subsequently be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of European tenders by project accounts was generally lower than the share provided for in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected contract values for construction projects exceeded the European limits, contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-lots exceeding €1m (£25m).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving good reasons for the need to deviate from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">OWN</seg>
<seg id="339">Choose tender type</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a major sporting event and construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several lots, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods for calculating the forecast price</seg>
<seg id="343">The pricing standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for setting the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on prices quoted in the completed proceedings, which were however burdened by both uneconomic and excessive profits for suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price norms.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to prices from the past, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the case of ground-based construction, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or the investor's estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then differed considerably from the forecast price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The projected cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but it increased by CZK 54 million, or 27%, during the execution.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of a depository for this library, the contract price was 33% lower than forecast.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the successful applicant's price was higher than the anticipated price and increased even further in the course of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">For the construction of the large library, it was by 400 million CZK, or 22%. For the construction of the Justice Palace, the actual price increased disproportionately (by 139%) over the increase in functional areas (only by 12%) during the construction process.</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on choosing the type of procurement procedure and respecting European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national arrangements of the two countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">Nevertheless, the principle of public governance in Germany is stricter than European and current national regulations in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a narrower procurement process, a public procedure or a public invitation to participate gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value for money effect.</seg>
<seg id="358">Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened as the pool of candidates is not constrained by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, thereby allowing room for price manipulation and fixation among bidders.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech law allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation in the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban on contracting authorities limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">Closer management has now come very close to open management.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, contracting authorities are largely fulfilling the requirement of a preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects have been subdivided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects carried out in Germany, European limits were not respected, which resulted in the minimum proportion not being reached in Europe-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">A satisfactory system has not yet been put in place in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements for the choice of the type of procurement process and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or create the conditions necessary to allow a correct calculation of the expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Provisional information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and contract notices are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">By means of prior information notices, the contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary notices are required for projects where the total cost estimate is equal to or greater than the European limit and where the contracting authority wishes to reduce the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">A procuring entity is required to publish a procurement notice with detailed information for all procurement that requires a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information shall be binding on the sponsor upon publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notice shall contain specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common procurement vocabulary must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="378">To avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, national notices should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notice is sent to the EU Publications Office.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in advance notifications can distort competition or even ease manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented EU pre-information and tender notices provisions in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">Procurement procedures shall not begin earlier than one month after dispatch of the prior information notice.</seg>
<seg id="386">It is only in exceptional cases that a provisional disclosure can be waived.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, prior information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procedures, the public invitation must be published on the federal government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In restricted procedures without competition from participants, a notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or above €25,000 ($625,000).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary notices must explain all planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">Division of projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Advance notice</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities published advance notices for the projects, which included works to be awarded in a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the advance notice and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other abridged procedures, the annual time limits for preliminary information had expired and were to be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the advance notice did not indicate an anticipated split of the construction works into multiple lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Tender Notice</seg>
<seg id="401">Some of the notices contained codes from the Common Dictionary that deviated from the content of the advance notice or did not specify precisely the work to be performed.</seg>
<seg id="402">In isolated cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on performance dates, or were published before a notice was published in the EU Official Journal.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting authority hired an outside company to publish a national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published notices on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.</seg>
<seg id="406">But the contracting authority did not check whether that company had to comply with the requirement to send further notices to a free online government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of notifications were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">OWN</seg>
<seg id="409">Tender Notice</seg>
<seg id="410">In the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not lay down in the notice of a restricted tendering procedure for the works contractor the criteria by which it would reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The method of selecting (reducing) tenders for evaluation has not been documented by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="412">Previous legislation allowed for a reduction in the number of bids.</seg>
<seg id="413">When constructing the road circuit, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice of the opening of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documents the values by which it would assess the level of compliance with the qualification criteria or the number of tenderers to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority assessed the qualification as having been met by all six candidates under the restricted procedure, but excluded one of them as having met in the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publishing calls</seg>
<seg id="417">For construction works in former military tours, the procuring entity failed to publish a written invitation to tender, in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations/summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-step information process with prior information and the publication of the Notice of Initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency requirements and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and strengthening this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Contrary to an open procedure, restricted procurement procedures do not allow participation by all potential bidders who would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the procuring entity first selects potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow a cap on the number of candidates in European restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, a restricted procedure requires at least five bidders to be invited to submit a bid and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential bidders must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently broad to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory and published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent tampering and ensure that it has effective control so that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting entities should rotate tenderers invited to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor is it permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of candidates and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in a restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in a negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except in two cases, the new Czech regulations do not permit limiting the number of candidates approached in the event of a restricted and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, when selecting candidates, the ‘four eyes principle’ must be respected.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes their list, another must substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by deleting a proposed candidate or installing another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to avoid a situation where an individual can definitively determine the range of candidates who will take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching illegal collusion between the parties is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers invited to submit a tender must be confidential and may not be divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor any measure for confidential treatment of the list of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under German provisions, they may not designate candidates from outside companies, but may submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of Leads</seg>
<seg id="454">Except in a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of candidates was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7,000 works contracts with a value up to the national limit showed that, for restricted procedures, contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential bidders and, for direct negotiated procedures, an average of 4.4 bidders.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, the contracting authorities did not change the range of applicants contacted in the area of building construction because they had a good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the event of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee to reach out to candidates whose suitability they had already ascertained beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the pool of non-public bidders included a larger proportion of regional bidders than it did for public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public tender and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-checking principle and proposals from self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">For the most part, contracting authorities ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">In particular, they argued lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who proposed the candidate who was asked to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="466">A check of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was drawn up by self-employed experts and accepted by the contracting authority without changes.</seg>
<seg id="467">As a result, contracting authorities were insufficiently protective against potential tampering.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of treatment of potential candidates lists</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for the invitation to tender in a database to which all staff had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed for manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of prospective or admitted bidders, who could then agree on a price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The dossier gave reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">OWN</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection criteria for candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">When the road circuit was built, the bidders were not informed of what of their qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For the event related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the tender notice for participation in the restricted procedure, the criteria for limiting the number of bidders were not established.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met the qualifications but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority had limited participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then selected the candidates using a random selection method — by drawing lots, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">That procedure should already have been mentioned as a criterion in the tender notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in selecting the winning bidder in limited procurement procedures, both countries have put in place special measures to prevent illicit restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">The German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (the four eyes principle), by keeping the list of tenderers confidential and by prohibiting external companies from making proposals for the selection of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions to manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the inspection found that some of the said rules were not applied to a sufficient extent and that an inadmissible restriction on the pool of candidates was not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities are obliged to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings completely.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement stage, in which potential tenderers can prepare their bids on the basis of the tender documents they have received, begins with the publication of the tender information and/or the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the opening date of the envelopes, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority must follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those rules relate in particular to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential contractors prepare their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Projection offices, which are involved in management, should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply the information to the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices in charge of drafting the tender dossier cannot provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Throughout this stage, any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing them to contact them may adversely affect the competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically submitted bids must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may instruct insured contractors to print and distribute the documentation, and their employees must be bound to observe confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and sent directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This staff member shall have no involvement in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="508">Tenders received must be locked until the opening date of the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, offers received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall draw up a report with the details of the competition, including the number of the tender and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no special rules for the safekeeping of bids.</seg>

<seg id="518">Information to be provided to candidates</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the procurement documents relating to interviewing and obtaining information, the procuring entity did not follow the rule of separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not include in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the Project Management Unit.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, candidates who raised questions during the procurement process did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Menu Labelling</seg>
<seg id="524">For the contracting authorities, all tenders received were stamped and receipted.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-building rule against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in an open mailroom compartment that all employees had access to.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed a mailbox in a corridor without constant supervision, and some of the bids thrown in the mailbox stayed there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The box opening was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">OWN</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">Rules are laid down in both countries to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices cooperating in the procurement process, throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all candidates.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, custody and confidentiality of offers.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany the requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, accumulated inspection records have shown breaches of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These discrepancies can easily be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of the envelopes, tenders that have so far been closed are opened, their contents read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period for which a tenderer is bound by its tender shall begin when the closing date for the submission of envelopes expires or when they are opened and shall end on a date determined by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect both tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of ‘more eyes’, transparency and trustworthiness in the process of opening envelopes are intended to prevent the manipulation and editing of tenders already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">Opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="552">Candidates may be present when the envelopes are opened.</seg>
<seg id="553">At the time of opening, all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Tenders received late must be disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="555">To ensure transparency in the opening of envelopes, this phase, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, but is not limited to, the names of the bidders and the prizes offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The entry must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>

<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Panel members may also be tasked with deliberating at subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. evaluating tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The head and, in the case of building, the recorder shall not be involved in the preparatory stage (drafting of the procurement documents), shall not be allowed to decide on the award of the contract and may not be a member in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require that the opening minutes contain not only the offer prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, such as damaged envelopes when tenders are received or received late.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the tender prices, an indication of the language of the tender and the signature authority of the tenderer must be included in the minutes drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require all parts of opened envelopes to be marked in order to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked in the form of a date-stamped perforation, must be kept confidential (secret) after the envelopes have been opened and may be disclosed only to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no similar measures in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single bid is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.</seg>

<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">The essential parts of the opening of envelopes in the two countries are identical with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, and thus allow the risk of corruption and manipulation to be substantially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more complex than the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent amendments to tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the personnel responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules on opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of bids</seg>
<seg id="595">The awarding authority must examine and evaluate tenders received within the time limit set.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, it must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process for assessing and evaluating offers in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The suitability of candidates is examined as a first step.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Tenders of non-eliminated tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published tender criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically advantageous tender and, in particular, examine all significantly low price offers.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be left to compete.</seg>
<seg id="606">The result of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference given to a tenderer or its disadvantage, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of good repute and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They also need to make sure that the process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">Consistent with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the examination and evaluation of tenders in successive steps.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements relating to the suitability of candidates, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or tender dossier may not be altered.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria established to assess the suitability of candidates cannot be applied further.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation may only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view, whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements likely to encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If, as a result of the evaluation of the tenders, a disproportionately low tender price is found, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment before any elimination of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, bidders must observe confidentiality and only authorised persons may take part in the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="621">The mathematical accuracy of tenders can only be reviewed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only staff who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the selection of the contractor or the implementation phase of the project may be entrusted with the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating the bids, they must be aware that the bids are confidential and honourably respect that fact.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a commission, appointed by the contracting authority, which will prepare a report proposing the conclusion of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently produce the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If bidders fail to meet this obligation, their bids must be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a candidate fails to substantiate them, they must be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, not only the overall price but also the unit prices have to be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the bid indicates that prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, bidders must be asked to explain.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to the different parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the overall price of a work is evaluated and the prices of the parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Price compensation is not a reason to exclude a bid.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more than the price estimated by the contracting authority or other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly aggregated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, a tender may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with unreasonably low prices have been received and the tenderers have not justified the prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not a reason for refusing to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike under German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is any suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this fact to the relevant superior authority without delay.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter must decide what action to take and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust or law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">Furthermore, they must approve (e.g. when the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Suitability testing and procurement criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined complied with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">For some of the recommendations of potential contractors, made by self-employed persons, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some procurement cases, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether all published evaluation criteria were taken into account by the contracting authority in the choice, or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of the construction projects, performing functions that were to be held solely by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contracting authorities sought to substantiate this with their insufficient human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review offers of services by persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and to carry out with due care their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As far as contracting authorities were concerned, there was generally no conclusive record of whether offers in the safe-keeping of self-employed professionals were available only to specified persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Menu review and mathematical review</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities passed open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first undertaking the prescribed examination of tenders and the mathematical examination and without documenting the results of those examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention to manipulate, third parties may have made changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">Examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the offers were not adequately labelled or where data on prices and products were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the pre-estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One out of 20 tenders was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, there was no record or sufficient documentation of the examination of tenders or of negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information such as unit prices of the most important invoiced items was also missing.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as the reason for deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contracting authorities argued that it was difficult to identify and prove balancing prices.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the range of ordinary contracting entities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">No data were recorded on closer examination of cost or on the reasons for deviations.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping on the tenderer to which the contract would eventually be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not made clear whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority rated that tenderer as a "low-cost company" that was unable to meet either quality requirements or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not annul the procurement procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that the said tenderer could be presumed not to have based its pricing on unreasonably high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting authority, and these were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement, two bidders submitted bids containing identical price calculations, prompting the contracting authority to exclude both bids.</seg>
<seg id="682">The inspections did not reveal any significant shortcomings in the application of the other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">OWN</seg>
<seg id="684">Suitability test</seg>
<seg id="685">For many building events, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in a procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority as set out in the tender specifications, or did not provide evidence of qualification to the extent required, or, conversely, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of a candidate who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Rating</seg>
<seg id="687">In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, although the various evaluation criteria of the contract award procedure for the contractor were established, they were not respected by the contracting authority during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For the railway infrastructure development action, the weightings of the award evaluation criteria were not set at the start of the evaluation process, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the assessment of the criterion of ‘shortening the construction period’ was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For second- and third-place bidders, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in construction time than indicated in their bids.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of candidate selection reasons</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate on what criteria it assessed the bids received and how it selected the most appropriate of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">The accuracy of the selection of small-scale contractors associated with the construction of a road circuit with an estimated price of up to 500K.</seg>
<seg id="694">The CZK could not be verified, as suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on price and delivery date, but no proof of these negotiations was produced.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of tenders comply with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">They differ, however, with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the choice of the individuals involved in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps of the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, it was found in some cases of checks that substantial steps in the process of verifying and evaluating tenders had not been documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The lack of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">The inspections showed serious deficiencies, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior proper examination and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of the functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased scrutiny of measures against increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In checking the legitimacy of the prices, the audited German contracting authorities did not in all cases make use of the complete set of tools available and did not address their own pricing structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, weaknesses were found in the evaluation of the suitability of offers and the use of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of tender</seg>
<seg id="707">After the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the procurement process is concluded with the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision to award the contract.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have an opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review if appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The 10-day time limit applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the review procedure has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of contractors by swiftly implementing the award decision.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority must document the progress of the procedure appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented management information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly conducted screening and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract at the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is because after this deadline the bidder is not bound by its bid.</seg>
<seg id="724">The contract content must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful tenderers are to be informed of the result in good time, stating the reason why their tender has not been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">Cancellation of the procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not comply with the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting time before the conclusion of a contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before a decision is taken on its EU provisions and review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure must be cancelled if a single tender was received or only one tender met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions set out in the tender specifications and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The inspections found few inconsistencies in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some instances of European proceedings, the enabling companies received letters before the reporting deadline, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also, in several cases of open procedures, letters of authorisation contained modifications incompatible with the tender content, e.g. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because a tenderer offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to perform the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">OWN</seg>
<seg id="741">In the refurbishment and construction of the college, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a works contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the successful tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some road repair and maintenance operations, the construction of the motorway and the ring road, contracts were concluded later than the statute.</seg>
<seg id="743">For construction works in former military tours, the contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection for failed candidates contributes to curbing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Law includes the Institute of Legal Protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding a contract was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting authorities should eliminate such shortcomings when concluding procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its stages, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement process at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">The data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Requirements of European Law and the Prevention of Corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental requirement of the EU-wide principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification gives a guarantee of transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds the European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed justification for individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of these procedures to the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notice in the Official Journal of the EU and this also fulfils the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the essential details of its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission produces annual statistics to provide an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.</seg>

<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those which are mandatory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the limit of €25K (£625K) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15K (£375K) including VAT.</seg>

<seg id="777">In one case, the contracting authority did not explain why it had contracted a tenderer whose tender did not include mandatory particulars.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Award Publication</seg>
<seg id="780">In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.</seg>

<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel audits of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures to prevent corruption are not only intended to avoid it or at least to reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the two countries' procurement law and the comparison of its respective provisions give an inside view of the common and different elements that may assist the two countries in the further development and application of this law.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries transposed EU procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">There is thus an important common base in both countries for public procurement and the fulfilment of basic requirements in the area of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting authorities reinforce these requirements in part with very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has extended public procurement provisions requiring a European procedure to procedures that are below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">Nevertheless, checks have shown that contracting authorities are not always fully compliant with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the irregularities mentioned, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the controls identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">These include, in particular, an incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the contract, which resulted in additional works often awarded in breach of the law, a lack of definition of the price envisaged, and the requisite qualifications, which narrowed down the potential pool of tenderers and thus reduced competition, particularly in the field of transport works.</seg>
<seg id="816">Preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The joint inspections were not aimed at detecting cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">They can nevertheless examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to curb corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In terms of preventing corruption, the two countries have focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">Above all, German provisions give room for broad and unrestricted competition, transparency, and controls as a central element in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations are mainly aimed at enhancing the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles for preventing corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been incorporated into the requirements of public procurement and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, at times with great precision, the ways of complying with the requirements to prevent corruption during the procurement process and the choice of the people included therein.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, procurement documents and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms for preventing corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting authorities should provide further training to their staff, familiarising them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant proportion of the weaknesses identified relate to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls in the delegation of powers increases the risk of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">OWN</seg>
<seg id="837">In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level, affecting the area of public procurement in a significant way.</seg>
<seg id="838">The audit actions of the SAO took place during the period of implementation of one of the most important parts of this strategy, namely a significant amendment of the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of the subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The strategy adopted and the new statutory provisions can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">Under the new rules, the contracting authority must, for example, justify the effectiveness of the contract, establish the anticipated value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualifications, establish the basic evaluation criteria and the way tenders are evaluated, and properly document and publish everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion of the ways in which EU requirements are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their broad application in practice has confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential for material and non-material damage resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of the contracting authorities to continue and improve measures against corruption and manipulation where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks to identify and respond appropriately to the need for remedial action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to the practice in Germany, it has emerged that the share of open procurement procedures should be increased in the Czech Republic, giving room for competition and substantially reducing the possibility of corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="848">Parcel procurement may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. The higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring its organisation also has an influence on the conduct of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport structures, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contracting organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and BRH wish to further develop the knowledge in their work where appropriate and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they believe that the principles of procurement law and its implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance to effectively tackle corruption and to ensure that public contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Controls on the Administration of Excise Duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint final report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="7">The submitted joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel controls carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on excise management in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the execution of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel controls was chosen based on the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to see how it is applied at national level, how the system of excise management is set up and how the systems in the SR and the CR differ.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of the control actions carried out were in exchanging experience, identifying differences and identifying good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, the benefit of finding that international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise administration is very limited without parallel controls.</seg>

<seg id="17">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="18">about the results of parallel controls of the SPD administration in SR and CR</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been identified between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, the verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issuance of permits and the mandatory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and certain other oils contribute to the efficient administration of excise duties; In SR, the distribution of control stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against evasion of excise duties, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the registration of sellers of consumer alcohol packaging have proved good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Revenue from excise duties in the SR and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, inter alia because there is no indexation of excise rates in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the materiality of excise duties in total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="26">The introduction of environmental measures has long been financially supported by the state, but the measures have a negative impact on excise revenue, which will thus need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by a reduction in the state's spending.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure incurred to manage excise duties in both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic has been growing over the long term, mainly due to wage increases, and their efficiency has been declining.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the SR, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the computerisation of excise administration (IT expenditure) and expenditure incurred on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="29">The electronisation of excise administration in SR has not had a significant effect on the reduction in the number of tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that the FŘ SR reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditure was affected by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period which would have led to a reduction in the personnel intensity of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrations was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the different years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The management of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and, given the ratio of the number of tax operations to the number of entities, more costly.</seg>
<seg id="35">The electronisation of excise administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise tax returns is fully electronised; in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronisation promote the efficient management of excise duties and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend applying them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure for the introduction of the EMCS could not be compared as the PSR only provided expenditure data for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but the expenditure was also made before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">The expenses incurred in that period only for the upgrade of EMCS were about 20% higher in SR than those incurred in the Czech Republic both for the introduction of EMCS and for the upgrade of this system over more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise tax managers in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparably.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of surveillance is comparable in both countries, but in the SR, the management of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of the Electronic System for Monitoring the Movement of Excise Products (EMCS) has made excise tax administration more efficient, but lower in the SR as significantly higher expenditure was spent on the introduction of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation of the two audit institutions was carried out under the Cooperation Treaty in carrying out parallel controls on the management of excise duties on 18.8.2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic agreed to carry out parallel checks, primarily focused on issues of excise administration, the results of which will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the findings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Joint audit questions were agreed on which the parallel controls were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Subject characteristics and objectives of parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise managers, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise management process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did excise tax managers in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparably?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has the introduction of the Electronic Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made excise administration more efficient and has the expenditure to introduce it been expedient?</seg>
<seg id="52">Parallel checks should have identified the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, especially in the regulatory and organisational structure setting.</seg>
<seg id="53">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The Directorate-General for Customs (DG) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (DG SR) have joined the Joint Declaration on Cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries, the objectives of the Declaration include the areas of excise duties including, inter alia, the fight against fraud, exploring the possibility of harmonising legislation and seeking harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, exploring the possibility of joint activities to increase efficiency in detecting fraud and sharing experiences and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 The EMCS is operated under Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of the audit carried out by the SAO of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="57">Check number: 15/33</seg>
<seg id="58">Subject of control: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="59">Objective of the audit: The aim of the audit of the SAO of the Czech Republic was to examine the customs authorities' procedure for the administration of excise duties, in particular for the monitoring of shipments in the system of conditional exemption from excise duties and for securing tax (customs debts); verify that the excise management system is set up to ensure the efficiency of state budget revenue collection.</seg>
<seg id="60">Period audited: 2012-2015 and, in case of factual context, the period before and after</seg>
<seg id="61">Controlled Person: Directorate-General of Customs</seg>
<seg id="62">Identification of the inspection carried out by the SAO SR</seg>
<seg id="63">Check number: KA-023/2016/1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Subject of control: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="65">Objective of the inspection: The aim of the inspection was an independent and objective examination of whether the FŘ SR and the customs offices (CA) operate economically, efficiently and effectively in accordance with universally binding legislation in the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="66">Controlled period: years 2012-2015</seg>
<seg id="67">Controlled Person: Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="69">The excise administration legislation is divided into the EU regulatory level (see Annex 1) and the national regulatory level (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the management of taxes and the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive allows taxes on consumption to be imposed on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">In particular, EU legislation lays down minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of product selected, the production, storage, processing and holding of products subject to tax, chargeability, exemption and refund, supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation makes it possible to introduce control procedures and institutes at national level, provided they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Excise Tax Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, the legislation on excise duties is concentrated in the Law on excise duties (Law 353/2003 Coll.), which governs the administration of the mineral oil tax, the alcohol tax, the tobacco product tax, the beer tax, the wine and intermediate tax and the raw tobacco tax.</seg>
<seg id="77">This law defines the forms of treatment of products subject to excise duties, the taxpayer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for the transport of products, the declaration of the tax and the penalties for infringements.</seg>
<seg id="78">In addition, the law and subsequent decrees regulate certain other conditions for the handling of mineral oils (mineral oil labelling), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and the storage of raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in Parts 45 to 47 of Act 261/2007 Coll., on the Stabilisation of Public Budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the management of excise duties are contained in special legislation. The Fuel Act No 311/2006 Coll. and the Implementing Regulation govern the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and the keeping of a register of fuel entered into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No 61/1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No 307/2013 Coll., on the compulsory marking of ethyl alcohol, and the relevant implementing provisions lay down the compulsory marking of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging, the conditions for handling surveillance tapes and the conditions for handling ethyl alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, storage, taking over, use, possession, import or export of ethyl alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">Tax procedure procedures not provided for in the special rules are governed by Act No 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">The penalties are imposed in accordance with the procedures laid down in Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Code of Administrative Procedure.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for issuing a trade licence (concession) to operate a business ‘production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuel’ and ‘production, treatment and sale of fermentation spirit, drinking spirit and spirits’ are governed by Act No 455/1991 Coll., on the Trade Licensing Business (the Trade Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has used the authorisation to establish control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to monitor compliance with the legislation when handling selected products for which excise duty has not been paid as well as when handling selected products for which duty has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These are the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, the labelling of certain other mineral oils, the labelling of tobacco products and ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic made use of the authorisation to apply excise duty to other products and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of amendments to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">Following the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 No 735, to implement the "Zero Tolerance Plan for the Black Market in Spirits," major legislative adjustments took place in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, introducing a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on spirit.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were also major changes in the legislation for the mineral oil tax, the tobacco products tax and the criminality of preparing tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal law protection of tax revenue</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminality of preparing the offence of "reduction of tax, fee and similar compulsory payment" is introduced. The arrangements made should allow police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. by deploying operational search resources.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions for excise management</seg>
<seg id="95">The issue of a licence to dispose of excisable products under the Excise Duties Act, with effect from 1.01.2015, is subject to: reliability; debt-free; economic stability; the right to operate a business enabling the exercise of an authorisation-related activity; a situation in which the claimant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of the build-up of tax arrears by reducing the entities authorised to deal with products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability newly allows the tax administration to take into account the financial situation of tax subjects both in the context of the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation has been granted.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities that do not have sufficient financial revenue to comply properly with tax obligations from handling the selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">To assess the economic stability of the proposer, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which the financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax authorities depends on the individual circumstances of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law provides for a periodicity of verification of compliance with the economic stability condition due to the timeliness of the data — the verification is carried out once a year following the deadline for filing income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax authorities have the option to lay down other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the permit holder does not comply with the conditions, the tax administration is entitled to revoke the permit, or to revoke it deferred if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="104">Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeded the amount of collateral tax (e.g. recurring beneficiary).</seg>
<seg id="105">Permits were revoked for 10 entities, other applicants increased the security of the tax, capitalised their contribution to the company or substantiated up-to-date accounting data showing that they already met all the conditions for issuing a permit.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the claimant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must be met by a natural person who is or is a member of the statutory body or by a natural person who, although not a member of the claimant's statutory body, carries out that activity (a chain of legal persons in the capacity of the statutory body or its member, so-called tied entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 linked subjects had been screened.</seg>
<seg id="108">The registers kept under the Excise Duties Act (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) contain data on:</seg>
<seg id="109">the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, received, delivered or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment arrangement (conditional exemption arrangement, importation, re-introduction to a conditional exemption arrangement, exportation, free circulation, captive consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of the event and the record entry;</seg>
<seg id="111">transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, transport numbers);</seg>
<seg id="112">the registration numbers of the related documents;</seg>
<seg id="113">notification of the release for free tax circulation of the spirit in a consumer pack marked with a surveillance tape and details of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="114">A record of the take-over after transport shall be made as soon as it is completed.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of an electronically maintained register, the register must be kept or allow output in the format xls, xlsx, ods.</seg>
<seg id="116">Alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, Schedule A) from the production of raw alcohol to the marking with surveillance tape to its distribution to the final seller or to the entitled user of the exempt alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, the production facility for the production of ethyl alcohol, which is not in operation, is subject to supervision by customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview over the processing of spirit drinks and the production of spirit drinks and to identify those handling spirit in consumer packaging, to reduce the disposal of spirit to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and marking of spirit drinks.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most significant measures are: the production, intake, stock records and the release of ethyl alcohol contain information on the quantity of ethyl alcohol by stages of production and processing of ethyl alcohol, indicating the numbers of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limitation of the volume of the consumer packaging, the material of the packaging and limitation of the number of packages with broken surveillance tape at the point of final sale or issue to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging with a capacity of not more than one litre or three litres if it is a container made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Spirits in larger packs are regarded as non-branded and prohibited from being handled.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of final sale to a natural person for his or her personal consumption, a maximum of one consumer pack with a broken surveillance tape, or three if fitted with a one-way valve, can be found.</seg>
<seg id="125">Compulsory registration of a person who places ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging products having at least 15% alcohol by volume into free tax circulation and is: an importer of ethyl alcohol, a producer of ethyl alcohol in the Czech Republic or a tax warehouse operator under a conditional exemption regime, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="126">The personal conditions — reliability, integrity and non-disclosure of the disqualification — must be met by the applicant and a person in a position of authority or responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="127">The applicant must provide a bail of between CZK 100,000 and CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. about €3,700 and €185,000), depending on the estimated amount of control tapes collected.</seg>
<seg id="128">The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place to mark ethyl alcohol and to equip the place of marking or tax warehouse with a continuous-traffic camera tracking device and remote access by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="129">Registration markings of the surveillance tape are in place for the marking of spirit drinks of more than 0,06 litre.</seg>
<seg id="130">When the control tapes are transported, the registration mark of the control tapes must appear on the transport documents or customs declaration at export.</seg>
<seg id="131">The check tape until 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration sampling number, an application code for the allocation of check tapes and a classification code according to the ethanol concentration level by volume.</seg>
<seg id="132">The surveillance tape from 1.12.2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of ethyl alcohol in the consumer package expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, rounded down to the whole millilitres.</seg>
<seg id="133">The register of surveillance tapes for the marking of spirit drinks contains daily records of each method of handling the surveillance tapes according to the registration codes, as well as the documents on the basis of which the registration took place.</seg>

<seg id="137">Restrictions on the treatment of surveillance tapes only to registered keepers who are not allowed to pass them on to another person, with the exception of their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking consumer-packaged spirits produced outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">Exported surveillance tapes must be placed on the consumer packaging and imported back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of a distributor of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack, provided that similar personal conditions are fulfilled as for the person required to mark ethyl alcohol and with an obligation to post bail of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €185,000).</seg>

<seg id="142">They may acquire ethyl alcohol from other registered persons, an insolvency practitioner, an administrative body, organisational units of the State or non-registered persons in the execution of a tax execution.</seg>
<seg id="143">Notices of the placing of ethyl alcohol or sales in consumer packing for free tax circulation are required to be sent by the holders and distributors of ethyl alcohol immediately following the operative event to the tax authorities by means of an information system maintained by the tax administration (ORO web client) or in accordance with content in xml format.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification shall include the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of ethyl alcohol, the European Commodity Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or final seller, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.</seg>

<seg id="152">Checks on compliance with the legislation on the treatment of products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic are also ensured in their activities outside the tax administration: trade offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.</seg>
<seg id="153">If it finds that there has been a breach of duty or prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise duty officer.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has put in place a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Schedule B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty but also selected mineral oils subject to excise duty unencumbered which have been abused for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil through the storage, transport, marking and colouring of selected mineral oils, the marking of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, the consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">Customs supervision includes the production of markings for the marking and handling of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="158">Mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (kerosene others), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not elsewhere specified) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 are subject to the marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils unless their marking is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">For example, benzole, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion are subject to the labelling of certain other mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="160">Selected mineral oils and certain other mineral oils can only be branded and coloured with a tracer if authorised by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="162">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which are a group of mineral oils under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2 s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: a flash point lower than 150 °C, at least 20 % by volume including losses up to 350 °C shall be distilled during the distillation test.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils were misused as an additive in the finished fuel, in particular diesel fuel, or were directly used or sold for motor propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres must register with the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="167">For the issuing of the registration, the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be fulfilled, which shall apply throughout 2 Except for beer, fruit wines, other wines and meads and fruit spirits obtained by firing.</seg>
<seg id="168">No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.</seg>

<seg id="170">registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">As of 30.11.2016, the Register of Persons Handling Specific Mineral Oils contained 54 valid marketing authorisations, four marketing authorisations were revoked on the proposal of the marketing authorisation holder.</seg>
<seg id="172">The electronic register shall contain detailed information on receipt, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil, including document numbers, notification numbers of acquisitions by the tax authorities, places of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or, at the time of sale, place of delivery and customer registration number.</seg>
<seg id="173">Notification of any acquisition of the special mineral oil must be given to the tax authority between 24 and 72 hours before acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="174">The identification of the commercial partners, the name and nomenclature of the particular mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of the consumption or information on the sale or transfer shall be notified.</seg>
<seg id="175">The notification of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notices of the purpose of use and labelling, the place of storage or consumption, the identification details of the person to whom the special mineral oil is resold or transferred, shall be provided before any change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications shall be made electronically using smart forms or a PDFa data container.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils filed 630 notifications.</seg>
<seg id="179">The provision and forfeiture of special mineral oils and, where appropriate, means of transport must be pronounced by the tax authorities in cases where they find the disposal of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to fulfil his obligation to notify.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of non-compliance in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied retrospectively.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="183">Compulsory trade authority concession (a specific form of business licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The customs office shall give an opinion on the application for the concession, or on the appointment of the responsible representative, as appropriate, examining whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the applicant's statutory body, the legal person and the appointed responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">Where such persons meet the reliability condition, the customs office shall issue a favourable opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person is a person of impeccable character, from the point of view of criminal assets, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">Expertise is a condition of the concession.</seg>
<seg id="188">The indebtedness of the same circle of people as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">The debtor is the person who provides sufficient guarantees that he or she will duly and timely discharge his or her payment obligations to the State, i.e. he or she does not have arrears on the State budget and on universal health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">A fuel distributor shall not be prohibited by a court or administrative authority from carrying out an activity which makes it impossible to carry out his activity.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fuel distributor must not be wound up or bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="192">The deposit of a security (or bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. around €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000 (i.e. around €370,000) after three years of registration as a fuel distributor and the fulfilment of other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="193">Notice of fuel distribution shall be given by the distributor to the customs office within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">The electronic notification shall include details of the individual purchase and sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="195">The data reported are data on trading partners, document numbers, product selected, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="196">Entitlement to repayment of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced in late 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">Only an activity which is clearly related to an activity carried out on land can be claimed for reimbursement of excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were about 64,000 claims for tax refunds, totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (or €43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">As of 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced a refund of fuel excise duty to livestock farmers.</seg>
<seg id="200">Farmers or breeders who, for example, are involved in cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will be able to make this claim.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on sales of old-rate tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term failure to achieve budgeted revenue from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced with effect from 1.12.2014 restrictions on the sale of old-rate tobacco products in the event of a change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco label is understood as placing it on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Duties Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the application of the rate of excise duty, the production of the tobacco product in the condition intended for the final consumer is decisive, without the need for it to be removed, delivered, dispatched or sold, or sold to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet characterising the excise duty rate appears on the tobacco sticker along with the price to the final consumer of cigarettes, and the sticker indicates the number of items in the pack or the quantity of tobacco to be smoked in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">The tobacco sticker has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of ready-to-eat cigarettes bearing a tobacco sticker with the previous (old) rate of duty has been fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month after the new rate of excise duty takes effect.</seg>
<seg id="210">Developments in the removal of tobacco labels in 2014 and comparisons with those in previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly pre-loaded tobacco products with the "old" tax rate each year, effectively shifting the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Raw tobacco tax</seg>
<seg id="212">Because of the misuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without the permission of the tax authorities and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and the monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">With effect from 1 July 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products shall be subject to excise duty on delivery to another Member State or a third country or for which the origin, the purpose of use or the person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on handling raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as the supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, the marking of unit packets with surveillance tape and restrictions on sales at designated points have been added to the restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">Manufacturing equipment for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or modified.</seg>
<seg id="218">Only a person meeting the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which is valid throughout the registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions of registration are: (a) authorisation to operate a business enabling the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) debt-free, (d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been declared prohibited from carrying out his activity, (e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the granting of a bond of CZK 20,000 (i.e. around €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="220">The electronic register must include the date of receipt or delivery of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the commercial partner, an indication of the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">Information on the commercial partner, quantity of raw tobacco, storage address, purpose of use and carrier details shall be reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">The notification of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of raw tobacco received or shipped shall be submitted by the body together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications shall be submitted electronically through a data container in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document containing the prescribed particulars.</seg>
<seg id="226">Excise Tax Legislation in SR</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating the area of excise duties in the SR is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">The various types of excise taxes are exhaustively determined by the SR legislation, which is similar to that of surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in SR</seg>
<seg id="230">Legislative arrangements for excise duties are secured by four laws on a subject-by-subject basis.</seg>
<seg id="231">The harmonisation was achieved by the adoption of the following excise laws: Act No 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All excise laws are substantive laws and deal with the taxation of the object of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No 563/2009 of the Z. z., on the Administration of Taxes (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, the rights and obligations of tax subjects and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework has transposed individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and has also transposed provisions of other directives and European Community legislation.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of legislative changes for different types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of the SR inspection</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, the excise administration legislation has undergone several major changes to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In EMCS, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duty under the conditional exemption regime has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where such traffic is monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Under the EMCS electronic system, the suspension of access to the EMCS by tax entities was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the option to suspend access precisely when there is a justified concern about a tax that has not been paid or determined in previous tax years and is not recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="241">This concerns the payment of the tax, as the composition of the security is required for the transport of excise goods, but it is released by the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011 when the option to use so-called red diesel was removed.</seg>
<seg id="244">Labelled gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The abolition of red diesel was aimed at reducing the public deficit, simplifying the system of taxation of mineral oils and reducing the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel retailer.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce a record-keeping obligation for all service stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">Making the movement of taxed petrol and diesel more transparent is linked to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">New institutes of tax entities were introduced in 2014, namely the distributor of motor fuels and the consumer of motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="252">This change has contributed to eliminating the emergence of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and has clarified the movement of these propellants (see Annex 4, Schedule A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">However, in SR, these mineral oils are not subject to the indication requirement.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise Duty on Tobacco Products</seg>
<seg id="256">As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of the tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Ingredient Act has been extended and a new tax entity - the tobacco trader - has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, an obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packages of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">Cigarettes, cigarillos and tobacco are marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the purchaser of the surveillance stamps must apply electronically to the customs office to issue the surveillance stamps, using an information system for the collection of the surveillance stamps.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state stamp printing house was set up - in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of surveillance stamps has also been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system for printing control stamps strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control stamp to simply verify that goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">The unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. instead is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.</seg>
<seg id="268">The control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes shall also bear the price of cigarettes, the mark for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in consumer packs and the length of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three substantive law provisions were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to alcoholic beverage taxation, solutions to their production, monitoring of movement, ensuring tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline the administration of the tax, reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of tackling the issue of the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty to alcoholic beverages and took into account the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="273">For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale fermented beverage producer has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household of not more than 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the purchaser of the surveillance stamps must apply electronically to the customs office to issue the surveillance stamps, using an information system for the collection of the surveillance stamps.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state stamp printing house was set up - in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of surveillance stamps has also been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Schedule B) and the elimination of falsification of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system for printing control stamps strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control stamp to simply verify that goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">The unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12. instead is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise taxes on ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law No 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">The solid fuel tax, the tax on natural gas and certain other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the SR, by contrast, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, apart from the Alcoholic Beverages Excise Tax Act, which contains a tax on ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A separate law regulates excise duties on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, from 1.1.2015, the issuance of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Law on Excise Duties is subject, among other things, to proof of the economic stability of the applicants, which is verified annually by the customs authorities by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the RS, a similar form of analysis is undertaken only when deciding to waive or reduce the collateral tax.</seg>
<seg id="292">The FŘ SR carries out tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the finance directorate over the handling of the control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printing works and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law provides that Mincovna Kremnica, a state-owned company, is to produce the inspection marks.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and check strips in the Czech Republic is not supervised by the customs authorities at the printer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and check bands will be taken from the printer by the competent territorial office of the Kutna customs office.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco labels are taken over by their customers in this territorial location, surveillance tapes to mark the ethyl alcohol are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the location of the markings.</seg>
<seg id="297">The Czech legislation does not define the manufacturers of tobacco stickers and check bands.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological installations for the production of tobacco products or parts thereof, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco label bears excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco stickers are removed from the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">In SR, on the other hand, the control mark does not include excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">A refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the Czech Republic during the audited period for their use for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">As of 2017, this tax refund was extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In the SR, such support for farmers is not in place (it existed until 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a bond of CZK 20 million (i.e. €740,000) has been introduced in the Czech Republic for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1,891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">In the SR, a similar fuel distributor is introduced, but without the deposit needed to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">In SR, 303 distributors were registered in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In SR, there is an institute of fuel retailer and fuel consumer, which is licensed by the local competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils are subject to labelling, as well as some other mineral oils; in the Slovak Republic, following the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the surveillance tape for the marking of spirit contains an eight-digit individual code to verify the origin of spirit and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirit spirit level under which the record of surveillance tapes is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss and return of the surveillance tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape shall also be required to notify its use within the same time limit.</seg>
<seg id="314">In SR, the control mark for the labelling of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack contains a unique 12-digit identification number which, if used, is communicated to the tax authorities once a month and is used to check the authenticity of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register contains the number of control marks taken, used and returned.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="317">In SR, registration is subject to conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol of at least €100 000 or paid-up capital of at least €100 000; minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is subject, among other things, to a deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax administration for the entire duration of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In the RS, the production of ethyl alcohol, not only in consumer packaging, requires the permanent presence of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of ethyl alcohol in a consumer pack requires a special form of registration of the person required to mark ethyl alcohol, with a condition of bail in favour of the tax authorities of between CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) and CZK 5,000 (i.e. €185,000) according to the quantity of control tapes taken and the installation of a tracking device with continuous access by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic goes far beyond the EU's minimum requirements for the object and management of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as those identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrations to do more to prevent the emergence of possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves), excise duty on raw tobacco and tobacco raw material was introduced in addition to EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although neither raw tobacco nor tobacco raw material is a harmonised tobacco product, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movements.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that checking economic stability for applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has worked well because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both supervisory institutions recommend applying such screening also in SR conditions.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in SR than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs with the costs related to transportation between the printer and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The SR's financial administration has a better understanding of the existence and location of technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, the levying of the tax on tobacco products is more efficient, as the order of the tobacco sticker itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">The financial administration in the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the sales points for propellants, thanks to the introduction of the "seller of propellants" and "consumer of propellants" institutes.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of mandatory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils at a reduced rate of tax, or exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and SR (2014), a new check tape or stamp containing an identification code was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The surveillance tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">Impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of the consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark or tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic can also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-ient approach that does not block tax entities' funds.</seg>
<seg id="341">By contrast, the CR's approach is rather restrictive, since it introduces a bail-in weighing on the cash flow of tax entities, but it reduces the risk of tax arrears more.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of excise revenue</seg>
<seg id="343">An excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State to increase the revenue of the State budget and also to regulate the amount of goods sold whose consumption is considered harmful to individuals and/or to society (the regulatory function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Communication from the Commission: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.3.2010 under the Resource Efficient Europe flagship initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including by revising energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">To achieve the EC's aim, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxation, among other things, as part of a greater "greening" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of tax revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic includes the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP is also monitored by, among others, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to query the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP fell slightly, according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">The European Central Bank's rate of exchange was used to convert the amounts in CZK into € on the 31st 12th of the relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The denomination of CZK against €1 in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year against 2012 (from 25.140 to 27.425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Bank Board on 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of excise collection, excise rates and per capita income in € have decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off revenue shortfall from excise duties on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of old-rate tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also affected by a rise in revenue tax collection, which has grown significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">Excise duties on mineral oils account for the largest share of total excise collections (about 55.7% in 2015), but this has fallen despite significant growth in the economy compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively impacting the tax's revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible proportion are the natural gas tax, the solid fuel tax and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the absence of a rate increase, their share will decline in the future in view of the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a massive case of tax fraud involving the putting into circulation of untaxed ethyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol containing methanol or an under-denatured ethyl alcohol in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such behaviour and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the 2012 recovery by €4m.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of tax on tobacco products has increased as a result of increasing rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duties varied between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on manufactured tobacco, where the rate was increased mainly to comply with Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on manufactured tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's currency intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, has fallen significantly. For tobacco products, it has risen only slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the excise rate is not set, so the excise duties function of regulating socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">As the Czech Republic's economic growth and living standards rise, real excise rates fall.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment is made on the basis of a law or a contract (in the case of pensions paid by the State, this is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="371">In the current legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the indexation of the level of excise rates to the evolution of consumer prices is not addressed because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all the excise taxes introduced in Slovakia, it is the excise duty on mineral oils that accounts for the largest share of the national budget's full-year tax revenue, with the proportion not falling below 52% over the whole period audited.</seg>
<seg id="377">The second largest share is accounted for by excise duties on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">This tax accounts on average for around 32% of total excise collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015 there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per capita of SR.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to a rise in excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption by the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth in excise collection per capita of SR is constant and corresponds to the evolution of excise rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention on the currency rate of the crown against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2.7 and 2.8 times higher in the Czech Republic, respectively, but per capita of the Czech Republic the collection is already only about 1/3 higher for these selected products.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and the price of CZK against the € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">For the mineral oil tax, the cause is also greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of the tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a not insignificant effect.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic were falling as a result of the CNB's interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift away from labour taxation to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the figures achieved for the share of excise duties have consistently been above the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is influenced in particular by the change in excise rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures, which are subsidised by the state in various forms, will need to be compensated by other revenues or reductions in state spending.</seg>
<seg id="392">In the absence of indexation of excise rates in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, their regulatory function is reduced and there is insufficient support for the EU's objectives of making Europe less dependent on environmentally harmful sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic translates into higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the management of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the level of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the administrative cost effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="397">The efficiency of the tax administration affects the scope and organisational set-up of the tax administration, the management of the organisation, the legal environment and the level of computerisation of the various activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The calculation of the administrative cost effectiveness of the tax administration by the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in a line-managed structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the management of excise duties is carried out, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organisational arm of the state and an entity.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax is managed by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, with customs authorities being the internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included in aggregate for the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, in view of the possibility to compare the efficiency of excise administration, the expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included in the calculation of administrative cost efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of excise administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The Administration of Excise Duties is a complex of administrative tasks carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial control tasks are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">In particular, excise duties are administered by the following departments:</seg>
<seg id="406">Directorate General of Customs</seg>
<seg id="407">Department 23 TAX</seg>

<seg id="433">Administrative costs of excise administration in SR</seg>
<seg id="434">Since 1.1.2012, the Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a challenging transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The creation of the PŘ SR was also reflected in the staff mix of the newly formed departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the context of the performance of excise management, excise management activities within the organisational structure of the FŘ SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.</seg>
<seg id="437">Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Taxation Section FŘ SR Excise Duties Department (Slovak-wide scope):</seg>
<seg id="438">excise departments - guide and coordinate excise management activities; draw up expert opinions; submit proposals and comments on legislative changes; issues decisions on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax entities; assigns and deletes registration sampling numbers;</seg>
<seg id="439">Tax Supervisory Unit — directs and coordinates activities in the exercise of fiscal supervision and control; exercises fiscal supervision;</seg>
<seg id="440">ELO and SPD systems unit — directs and coordinates administrative mutual cooperation activities in the field of excise duties, including exchange of information through SEED and MVS systems; provides management and updating in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;</seg>
<seg id="441">Control Marks Department – regulates printing activities and handling of control marks; exercises fiscal supervision over the handling and disposal of printing sheets and control marks in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="442">Vice President of Financial Management</seg>
<seg id="443">Excise and Customs Remedies Department (Slovakia-wide scope):</seg>
<seg id="444">excise appeals unit — reviews customs decisions on the basis of regular and extraordinary appeals made; appeal procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="445">A section of customs offices was created in the course of 2012; under it were directly incorporated individual customs offices (9 customs offices) which have a territorial scope determined by higher territorial units, with the exception of one customs office which was established, inter alia, to carry out tasks in relation to the external border of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">excise departments — carrying out methodological activities in relation to customs offices' branches and customs offices' stations; for the selected entities, the direct actions of the tax administration are determined by the registration (tax warehouse, beneficiary recurring, registered shipper), the amount of the tax collateral, the determination and refund of the tax, the tax supervision and the tax control; decides to waive the deposit of the tax collateral; Decides to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in a tax warehouse for ethyl alcohol;</seg>
<seg id="448">legal department - decision-making activities on tax infringements; activities relating to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax execution procedures;</seg>
<seg id="449">Customs office branch - decides on registration (except for tax warehouse, receiver, registered consignor), the amount of tax collateral; prescribes and refunds tax; performs tax oversight and fiscal control; decides on the security and forfeiture of goods;</seg>
<seg id="450">Customs office station — exercise of fiscal supervision over the possession and movement of goods subject to excise duties; Ensuring the exercise of permanent tax supervision in a tax warehouse for ethyl alcohol; deciding on the security and forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">Spending by the SR's financial administration on excise management is growing steadily as, with the exception of wage increases, investments are increasing to manage taxes efficiently and electronicalise the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although excise revenue grew, spending grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">In the Slovak Republic, wage expenditure is significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on excise management increased more significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, mainly due to an increase in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise taxes also grew at about the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the wider competencies of the customs administration, e.g. weighing of trucks, checking the fulfilment of duties related to the myth, compared to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="457">Administrative cost efficiency in SR shows a slightly worsening trend year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee increased.</seg>
<seg id="459">In the Czech Republic, too, the number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew more slowly compared to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, wage growth is a major factor in the deterioration of administrative expenditure efficiency, which can be seen as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining a high administrative burden in excise management seems to be a negative factor, as confirmed by the shrinking number of staff in excise management.</seg>
<seg id="463">In the SR, however, managing excise duties at lower incomes is significantly more challenging for staffing capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of excise administration</seg>
<seg id="465">The management of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the management of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration, transport supervision, control and search of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="467">Numbers of administrative tasks and entities managed are indicators of the performance of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrations expresses the efficiency of the tax administration's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisation and registration for the activity are essential preconditions for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax authorities are required to perform a systematic administration of authorised or registered entities, with a focus on supervising compliance with the legislation and conditions laid down by the tax authorities, to which adequate staffing resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The observed indicator was the number of valid permits or registrations for activity at 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are concrete administrative acts on the merits.</seg>
<seg id="474">The administrative acts monitored are the frequency of the most significant actions of the tax administration (tax claims, traffic administration in EMCS), or those that are a sequence of actions ending in a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Permission and registration for activities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">The products selected may be manufactured, processed, stored, received or dispatched with the permission of the tax authorities to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the operator of the tax warehouse has multiple warehouses, a permit shall be issued for each separately, including securing the tax.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administration (i.e. the physical presence of the official and the securing of the equipment by the tax administration's accounts).</seg>
<seg id="481">Permanent tax supervision is not applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="482">The tax warehouse operator also registers for tax under Section 125 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">An authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products, conditionally exempt from tax, from the place of importation to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to the place of exportation in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replacing the status of registered consignor under Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, excluding tax, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.</seg>
<seg id="485">Growing spirit produces alcohol at a reduced 50% tax rate (£14,300/hl ethanol) — fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and operating permits are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced rate of tax can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower destined for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The register of cultivation burning, kept by the operators of the brandy and made available to the tax authorities, must include details of the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">A beneficiary for re-receipt of selected products and a beneficiary for one-off receipt of selected products shall be entitled, subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities and the conditions laid down, to receive or re-receive selected products on a one-off basis under a conditional system shipped from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of the selected tax-exempt products is the legal or natural person who accepts and uses, or sells the selected tax-exempt products to another user, according to §§ 52a or §53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">Exempt products selected may be accepted and used only on the basis of a valid authorisation, and only from the supplier indicated in the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of the authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another authorisation holder or user who is authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Mineral oils may be sold exempt without a licence in statutory cases, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if produced by the user himself or generated by his activity,</seg>
<seg id="495">Selected mineral oils exempt from tax in unit packets of not more than 20 litres for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production, and for sale at the same time to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">Selected exempt products may be transported with proof of exemption.</seg>
<seg id="497">The distributor of the consumer-packaged spirit shall be entitled, after compulsory registration with the tax authorities, to sell or otherwise transfer the ethyl alcohol put into free circulation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="498">A storer of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, subject to registration with the tax authorities and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="499">A person handling special mineral oils shall be entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils which are in bulk or placed in packaging exceeding 220 litres, on the basis of registration with the tax authorities and subject to specified conditions.</seg>
<seg id="500">The fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel in the territory of the Czech Republic, except for the sale of fuel from a service station, on the basis of the concession issued and the registration of the tax administrator under specified conditions.</seg>
<seg id="501">The PHM transport must be accompanied by a tax document, proof of sale or proof of transport, where appropriate, a distribution plan and bottling vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent by the tax authorities before the transport begins.</seg>
<seg id="503">The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where the sale or delivery of PHMs is permitted, as a general rule, to the fuel tank, subject to a permit from the building authority.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators with a breakdown into: registered - normal sale or delivery of PHMs generally to vehicle fuel tanks; with a defined approach - operating generally in different business premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, farm farms, transport organisations, construction yards), sales here are limited to the other party based on specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel outlets only for operators' own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="506">A service station is not a construction or installation in the form of an operating tank located in service (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is only issued for own use.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to the tax authority's authorisation and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and juridical persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free circulation for resale on the authorisation of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="509">They must also be authorised when buying or obtaining liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">Tax control is a set of operations. Tax control shall cover tax obligations, claims made by the taxpayer or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="512">Tax control can be carried out jointly for multiple tax procedures of a single tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">Repeated tax inspections may only be carried out under the conditions laid down by law and on the grounds when the inspection is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="514">Tax control is carried out within a tax-setting period of three years, with the deadline extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, launching criminal proceedings in relation to the tax in question), or suspended (legal proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The period for determining the tax shall end not later than 10 years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">There is no obligation on the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit on each taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="517">The commencement of the tax inspection suspends the deadlines for the possibility of the tax entity submitting a supplementary tax return or a supplementary statement (§ 141 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the deadline for determining the tax (§ 148 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">On the basis of its result, the tax may be levied ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administration searches for evidence and inspects premises, goods, documents, registers, means of transport and transport packaging at tax agencies and other persons involved in the tax administration, on the spot outside the premises of the tax administration (e.g. tax entity, point of sale, transport journey).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax authorities shall be entitled to borrow documents and items, to take samples and, where appropriate, to secure them.</seg>
<seg id="521">On the basis of the outcome of the local investigation, the tax cannot be assessed separately, but the taxpayer can be invited to submit a supplementary tax return (§ 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">Checking traffic data in EMCS is not a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="523">Ordering surveillance tapes to mark ethyl alcohol can only be made by the registered person required to mark ethyl alcohol to the tax authorities of the locally relevant place of marking, and is done through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the ethyl alcohol mark register.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the amount of control tapes ordered and orders the production.</seg>
<seg id="525">He doesn't oversee the production of surveillance tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">Production is provided by the State Printing House of Cenin, a state-owned enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">The customer of the check tapes shall take the check tapes to the tax authority of the locally relevant marking point.</seg>
<seg id="528">Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco serves as a tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco sticker shall correspond to the amount of the tax liability, with the purchaser of the tobacco stickers being required to pay their value within 60 days of the date of their removal from the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate in the order itself the value corresponding to the tax liability of the tobacco stickers ordered.</seg>
<seg id="531">This time limit only applies if the value of the tobacco stickers is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order for the tobacco stickers shall be made on a form established by the Ministry of Finance in writing or by means of a data container with the possibility of using intelligent forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">Manufacture of tobacco stickers is provided by the State Printing Company, a state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="534">The trustee of the tax, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (Kutná Hora's territorial site), ensures the purchase and transport of the tobacco stickers to the tax authorities, who distribute them and further examine their transport, storage and use with customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include regular tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco stickers, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">Included is not the declaration of tax under customs procedure based on customs declarations and the declaration of claims for repayment of tax on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of business other than for the production of heat or the propulsion of engines, mineral oils used for primary agricultural production.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include an administrative procedure to deal with the infringements identified, a set of successive administrative actions. The International Exchange of Information on Tax Entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes the form of: a request for administrative cooperation, replies to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, incident reports, inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport taking place under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax administration of the receiving or dispatching tax warehouse or the authorised consignee.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="540">Permission and registration to operate in SR</seg>
<seg id="541">The management of excise duties in SR is primarily ensured by the customs offices and the excise department of the Customs and Tax Division of the FŘ SR, whose procedure for the administration of excise duties is governed by the various laws on excise duties and the tax code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws lay down not only the scope of authorisation for the CA and the FŘ SR to administer excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax subjects in relation to registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, driven by an increase in tax warehouse permits issued, an increase in registrations of the authorised beneficiary for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user businesses.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification requirement if they are transported in bulk or in packaging of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils that are subject to control and transport procedure to other goods, such as anti-knock motor products, oxidation inhibitors, bitumen inhibitors, viscosity enhancers, anti-corrosive products.</seg>
<seg id="545">A mandatory indication regarding the indication of their kinematic viscosity has been introduced for lubricating oils.</seg>
<seg id="546">An approximation of the registration process with selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the SR is provided in the following sections of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Under national SR legislation, when registering a tax warehouse operator in respect of all excise goods, a person wishing to operate a tax warehouse must also apply for registration and authorisation to operate a tax warehouse at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is the certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CA issues a tax warehouse permit authorising the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="551">Where a tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax authorities shall issue a separate tax warehouse permit for each tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The transport of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement is monitored electronically by EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called</seg>
<seg id="554">An ARC code under which said shipments can be monitored online and therefore in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">Where the tax warehouse operator is also the person authorised to distribute the ethyl alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of the ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its release.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">A registered consignor is a special type of taxpayer who cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if he dispatches a subject of excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement after his release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under national SR legislation, when registering a registered consignor in respect of all excise goods, a person wishing to dispatch an excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement after their release for free circulation must also apply to the CA at the same time for registration and authorisation to dispatch an excise object under that arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, while also issuing an authorisation to dispatch the excise object under the duty suspension arrangement after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing spirit</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of growing brandy is to obtain authorisation for the production of alcohol at the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the permit itself from the Ministry does not entitle the holder of the licence to practice cultivation brandy.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order to be able to practise cultivation brandy, a person must apply to the CA to register and issue a certificate of registration as a producer brandy operator.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CA issues a registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, which also entitles the operator of the producer brandy to produce ethyl alcohol in the producer brandy.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of cultivation brandy is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Growing spirit cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislature allows a reduced rate of tax to be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in cultivation brandy, at 50% of the basic rate of tax, i.e. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced rate of tax shall be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in cropping spirit at a maximum quantity of 43 litres a. per grower and his household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore a reduced rate of tax can be applied to the ethyl alcohol produced more than once per calendar year, as the ethyl alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">It is the production of ethyl alcohol outside the conditional exemption scheme, which in practice means that the ethyl alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays not only excise duty and value added tax to the grower's distillery for the ethyl alcohol produced, but also the price for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The crop brandy issues the grower with a removal certificate, which serves not only as proof of the origin and method of obtaining the ethyl alcohol, but also as proof of payment of the excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">Transportation of the ethyl alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="575">Consumer Packaging Importer</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons intending to import consumer packs of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country as part of a business and to place them in free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packs.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of the consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA issues him a certificate of registration as a importer of the consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate authorises the importer to import consumer packs of spirit or consumer packs of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, he must lodge a tax guarantee on the amount of tax attributable to the quantity of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes he wishes to put into free circulation before the control marks are issued.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of a consumer pack must release for free tax circulation only a consumer pack marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, they must submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the surveillance marks exported to the territory of the third country.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer shall have the number of surveillance stamps imported back from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of importation.</seg>
<seg id="583">On importation of consumer packaging, the importer shall proceed in accordance with the customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty shall also form part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the event of the release for free circulation of the consumer package, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay a customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">Where the importer of a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol is also the person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer pack of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack of ethyl alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer pack which he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its release.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of consumer alcohol packaging in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislature has introduced a new tax institute of the seller of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person wishing to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CA for a permit and fulfil the legal conditions (business license for commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; has not had its marketing authorisation withdrawn for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of those goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="592">The holder of the authorization shall keep a calendar month record for each establishment of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation shall be obliged to purchase the ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack or otherwise take it in the course of business only from the person authorised to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="594">Consumer Alcohol Packaging Distributor</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislature has introduced a new tax institute, the distributor of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person intending to hold a distribution permit must apply to the CA for a distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must fulfil the legal conditions (a business license for a business activity; a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol of not less than €100 000 or paid-up capital of not less than €100 000; minimum number of 10 employees; has no arrears to customs; has no arrears on compulsory contributions; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; has not had its marketing authorisation revoked for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of those goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the method of acquiring the consumer packaging of the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="600">The holder of the distribution authorisation shall keep a calendar month record, for each establishment, of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to purchase the ethyl alcohol in the consumer package only from another person authorised to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorised to distribute shall report the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Fuel Seller</seg>
<seg id="604">A new type of tax entity, the fuel retailer, has been introduced to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation governing petrol stations in the territory of SR.</seg>
<seg id="606">That's why gas stations are incorporated as fuel retailers in the SR's national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person wishing to sell petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for final consumption in the course of business activity in the tax territory is required to apply to the CA for a sales permit before commencement of the sale and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device to measure the quantity of mineral oil when it receives and dispenses, and the tank must comply with the technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the fuel retailer is a tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or registered consignor, CA will also automatically issue a permit to sell fuel to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">A fuel retailer is required, among other legal obligations, to keep a register of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold in a calendar month and also to notify the CA of a new fuel supplier (distributor).</seg>
<seg id="610">A fuel retailer is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when the propellant is delivered by means of an auto tanker, the distributor, when pumping the propellant to the dealer, prints out the so-called bottler from the measuring device incorporated in the car tank.</seg>
<seg id="613">The document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="614">An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax authorities in the territory of SR, when exercising fiscal supervision over mineral oils, record tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="616">Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks when transporting, so hauliers use secondary roads, circumventing the toll collection system because of the more difficult monitoring of actual transports.</seg>
<seg id="617">Transportation of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tanks is also carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times, illegal shipments are accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change the route and avoid roadside control.</seg>
<seg id="619">Mixing of propellants with light fuel oils or waste oils also occurs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">A new type of tax entity, the distributor of the fuel, has been introduced to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person intending to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the free tax territory as part of a business activity shall, prior to commencing distribution, apply to the customs office for a distribution permit and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device, as well as a list of suppliers and purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="623">A fuel distributor is required, among other legal obligations, to keep separate accounts for each establishment of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold in a calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="624">A fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise source fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">A fuel distributor can only sell in the tax territory to a distributor of fuel, to a registered person or to a consumer of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when the fuel is supplied via an auto tanker, the distributor will print out, when the fuel is pumped, a so-called bottler from a measuring device incorporated in the car tank to the seller of the fuel or to the consumer of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="627">The document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="628">As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel or the registered person allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="630">Fuel Consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">The fuel consumer has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for his own consumption in the tax territory and stores that mineral oil in a storage facility of 15 000 litres or more shall notify the customs office at the latest before the first placing in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">Fuel consumers shall be entered in the register by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to the legal facts, he is required to give the address of the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage device must be verified and fitted with a measuring device enabling the amount of propellant (gauge, gauge bar) to be measured when receiving and dispensing.</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must meet technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must purchase the fuel only from the distributor of the fuel or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As the fuel is in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for transportation.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when the propellant is delivered via an auto tanker, the distributor will print a so-called bottler from the measuring device incorporated in the auto tanker when the fuel is pumped to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">That document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="642">An invoice, for example, which also includes the number of the distributor of the fuel allocated by the tax authorities, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="643">The tax authorities in the territory of SR, when exercising fiscal supervision over mineral oils, record tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the course of business and meets the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Provided that the conditions laid down by law are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. €2,652 per hl/percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to up to 200,000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As it is the production of beer outside the conditional exemption scheme, the accompanying document is not needed for transport as it is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family-run businesses that also run restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own production of beer for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative tasks in SR</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter approximates the exercise of excise tax administration tax supervision by selected tax entities within the meaning of the SR national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, driven by more EMCS traffic.</seg>
<seg id="654">In contrast, the biggest decrease year-on-year was in 2014, by up to 4.3%, driven by fewer tax checks completed and fewer tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="655">That decrease concerned legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax controls</seg>
<seg id="657">By exercising tax control, the CA ascertains or examines the facts crucial to the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">CA staff are shown, when carrying out a tax audit, by a mandate to carry out a tax audit which includes, inter alia, the purpose and subject matter of the audit and the extent of the tax years audited.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period can be one month, but also multiple tax years.</seg>
<seg id="660">The scope of audited tax years is determined by CA.</seg>
<seg id="661">Tax inspection begins with the writing of the tax inspection opening minutes.</seg>
<seg id="662">CA will confirm receipt of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="663">Borrowed documents shall be returned to the CA within 30 days of the completion of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="664">A CA employee from the tax audit draws up a report.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax audit identifies a difference in the total that the audited tax entity should have paid, declared or claimed a refund of, the CA will also send the audited tax entity a call for comments on the findings in the report, together with the report.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax inspection shall cease on the date of receipt of the report.</seg>
<seg id="667">The deadline for carrying out a tax audit shall not be more than one year from the date on which it is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="668">Tax checks on registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once before the expiry date of the right to establish the tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FŘ SR issued an internal management act adjusting the abovementioned time limits because of the uniform procedure of the tax administration in the territory of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local inquiries</seg>
<seg id="671">Local inquiries are the activities of the tax authorities in which they seek evidence, examine and establish facts which are needed for tax administration purposes.</seg>
<seg id="672">A CA employee will draw up a record of the local investigation and submit a copy to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="673">When carrying out a local investigation, a CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The clearance of the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced shall be ascertained by means of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The facts established are the basis for the exercise of tax control.</seg>
<seg id="676">Also in carrying out the local investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to safeguard the case.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and local investigation for individual excise goods in order to unify the tax administration's procedures.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax oversight in alcohol tax warehouses</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1.5.2004, there was also a change in the field of excise management.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state funds in administering excise duty on ethyl alcohol, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative instruments to more effectively curb the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in relation to excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the excise tax administration from the tax offices to the customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administration to be present in the alcohol tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of SR, national legislation defines exhaustively that it is only possible to receive, supply, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse in the presence of a CA employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches ethyl alcohol only in consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CA is obliged to safeguard employees in the tax warehouse in order not to restrict the receipt, supply, production or processing of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator incurs the obligation to safeguard working environment conditions for CA staff.</seg>
<seg id="686">Under the contract concluded with the FŘ SR for the premises provided, the CA pays the tax warehouse operator the rental costs each month.</seg>
<seg id="687">In a tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of ethyl alcohol, the production facilities for the storage of ethyl alcohol must be such that the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced, processed ethyl alcohol, stored ethyl alcohol, including stocks of ethyl alcohol and the alcohol contained therein, can be determined at any time.</seg>

<seg id="689">Where ethyl alcohol is not accepted, dispensed, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee, with the obligation to secure that area by sealing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this option is not used very often because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators make use of a legal option within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use the production facilities for the production of alcohol at the distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of the distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Around 250 customs officers provide permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issuing vouchers to collect alcohol control stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic procedure for collecting the control stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration take-off number and the issue of a receipt for the alcohol control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="695">Alcoholic beverage which is ethyl alcohol means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1,2 % vol.</seg>
<seg id="696">The trademark is intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">A sealed consumer container filled with spirit intended for direct human consumption is regarded as a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging of Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be released for free tax circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee and the importer of the consumer packaging, who will place it in free tax circulation, may label the consumer packaging with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="700">The check mark shall contain, inter alia, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number contains the registration take-off number (1st to 6th for the numerical digit), the volume of ethyl alcohol (7th to 11th for the numerical digit) and the bulk concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack (12th to 14th for the numerical digit).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original alcohol control mark pattern:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration take-off number shall be assigned separately by the CA to each purchaser.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a control mark, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the consumer package, the bulk concentration of the ethyl alcohol in the consumer package and the customer's control mark, may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of the ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">National legislation towards the end of 2014 brought in the introduction of a new information system for check marks.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new control mark information system was to simplify and computerise the ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of the control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of the consumer package and the consignee (buyer) of the alcohol may label the consumer packaging with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="707">A trademark purchaser wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply electronically to the customs office for the stamps to be issued.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the inspection marks is obliged to request their issue, to notify the data resulting from the SR national legislation and to keep a register of the inspection marks.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of consignments of the inspection stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.</seg>
<seg id="710">Also, the tax authorities communicate with the purchasers of the surveillance stamps through an electronic system of surveillance stamps, in particular when notifying the number of control stamps which may be withdrawn by the purchaser of the control stamps or when determining the date of acceptance of the control stamps by the purchaser of the control stamps at the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="711">The purchaser of the vignettes shall, before accepting the vignettes, deposit into the tax authority's account the funds corresponding to the price of the vignettes which he may withdraw, the quantity of which shall be notified to him by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the control mark takes into account the amount of the printer's refunds. However, it does not take into account the level of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">Control stamps are authorised to be printed by the state-owned Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="714">The FŘ SR carries out tax supervision over the handling of the inspection marks and their disposal at the printing works.</seg>

<seg id="720">A consumer pack of cigarettes can be put into free circulation only if it is marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is only possible to label the consumer pack of cigarettes with a control mark in a company that manufactures cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee or the importer of tobacco products wishing to place tobacco products in free circulation in the tax territory can be a purchaser of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only a control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the particulars of which correspond to the respective price of the cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of the cigarettes, the tax rate validity symbol and the registration take-off number.</seg>
<seg id="724">Consumer packs of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">National legislation towards the end of 2014 brought in the introduction of a new information system for check marks.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new control mark information system was to simplify and computerise the ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of the control marks intended for the marking of consumer packages of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">A trademark purchaser wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply electronically to the customs office for the stamps to be issued.</seg>

<seg id="737">It is only possible to label the consumer pack of cigarettes with a control mark in the business that manufactured them.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of consignments of the inspection stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.</seg>
<seg id="739">The CA shall, within three working days at the latest, electronically notify the buyer of the inspection marks of the number of inspection marks it may withdraw, the price of the inspection marks and the account number of the FŘ SR.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CA may reduce the number of inspection stamp units ordered if circumstances have arisen which make it reasonable to assume that tax infringements may occur.</seg>
<seg id="741">The FŘ SR shall determine the date of acceptance of the surveillance stamps by the buyer of the surveillance stamps, but no later than 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The date of receipt of the inspection marks shall be notified by the FŘ SR to the buyer of the inspection marks via the electronic system of inspection marks.</seg>

<seg id="746">Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and SPD systems unit of the Excise Duties Division of the FŘ SR is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information upon request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the relevant financial administrations.</seg>
<seg id="747">These include, in particular, requests to examine bodies within the excise administration, requests for information on excise administration, as well as requests to confirm information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications takes place electronically under EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following actions are included in the administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (request for screening, request for information on excise management, request for confirmation of registration in the SEED); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; check report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the Slovak Republic, permanent tax supervision is applied to tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by the tax administration through a tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouses, in the Slovak Republic they are only registered by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="755">In SR there is an institute of registered shipper which is included in tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In SR, it is possible to burn 43 l a with a reduced rate of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in case of cultivation burning.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of tax on ethyl alcohol can only be applied to 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">The growing spirit in SR must be authorised not only by the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows cultivation distilleries.</seg>
<seg id="760">In SR, the importation of consumer packs of ethyl alcohol is carried out by the importer of consumer packs of ethyl alcohol in addition to the tax warehouse operator.</seg>
<seg id="761">The importer's authorisation is subject to the applicant being registered with the excise duty manager.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax authorities is required to import a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In SR, the sale of a consumer pack of ethyl alcohol is subject to the issue of a tax administration permit to the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep a register of, inter alia, purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administration does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of ethyl alcohol by the trade office; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In SR, the fuel retailer must have permission from the tax authorities to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">The national legislation in the Slovak Republic does not provide for any special regulation of petrol stations, all activities relating to petrol stations are governed only by the Act on Excise Duty on Mineral Oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and a list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In SR, it is technically not possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In the SR, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">That increase was due to a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits dropped significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a bond for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="775">In the SR, substantive law provides for the obligation to exercise tax control on selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified in the internal management act issued by the FŘ SR for the purpose of applying the uniform procedure of tax administrations to the territory of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, the substantive law does not regulate the obligation to carry out a tax inspection, the procedural law only provides for the possibility of carrying out a check at the latest by the deadline for the tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and the local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR stipulates in which cases and within what time limits the tax authorities must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its reimbursement is verified in particular by the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative actions in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to the increase in the number of traffic in the EMCS system and at the same time due to the increase in the number of tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the SR, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of traffic in the EMCS system while decreasing the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and the registration of taxable entities were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrations was similar in the SR and the CR in the different years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In the Slovak Republic, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same amount of administrative operations.</seg>
<seg id="785">It can be concluded from this that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative tasks by tax administrations, such as the exercise of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote surveillance, e.g. surveillance devices, immediate data transmission via the web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronisation of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be filed through a data container.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, but they can no longer be processed in an automated way.</seg>
<seg id="791">In addition, the data must be entered into the personal tax account of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is a reduction in the error rate of filed tax returns (DAPs), which saves the actions of the tax administration related to the correction procedure for erroneously filed DAPs.</seg>
<seg id="793">DG is working on a new e-processing application for DAP.</seg>
<seg id="794">Through intelligent forms, the following can be used: to submit tax applications or registration for activities and notifications of changes to data, to claim a refund, to fulfil reporting obligations for the handling of special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of surveillance tapes is recorded by the tax subjects in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registration by the tax authorities of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">The transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transportation of selected products in free tax circulation within the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of excise duty exemption, decision of the customs office to place the selected products under a customs procedure, simplified accompanying document or other decision to levy excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required data content is set by law.</seg>
<seg id="799">To facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for the issuance of alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents sent via the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic web interface to a data warehouse where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">The ICU serves for control purposes by the customs authorities en route and prevents repeated transport on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of the fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free circulation, CS CR has online access to an electronic filing system, into which the entity automatically stores the tax documents issued.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for registering and monitoring the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should make use of 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for both declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be linked to a system of global guarantees, a register of tax entities or a system of risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of documentary evidence without registration and the sharing of procedural numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current procedure for registering the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the misuse of a simplified accompanying document, the repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronisation of administrative tasks in SR</seg>
<seg id="810">In the management of excise duties, the SR tax administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the conditional exemption regime, the control stamps, the submission of tax returns, as well as the registration and registration of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="811">A one-way electronic communication between tax entities and the tax authorities was also introduced in 2014 and extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">As part of electronic communications, a personal internet zone, known as an electronic personal mailbox, is made available to the taxpayer after the entry of the access data, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic registry through which he submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication via a personal Internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are required to communicate electronically with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="816">They are mainly value added tax payers, tax advisers representing a tax entity and lawyers representing a tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">The SAO also addressed the issue of the scope of electronisation of excise administration in the audit.</seg>
<seg id="818">Only fully electronic acts were involved, namely tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">Leaving aside the traffic carried out under EMCS, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">In SR, a fully electronised processing of the tax return is already in place, from its filing to the registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">The electronic processing of the tax return is not set up in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility is set up for tax entities to insert on the web page mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting traffic in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax surveillance, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid contrary to the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to the good practice in the Slovak Republic in the field of electronisation of tax returns, the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend completing the electronisation of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organisational structure and staffing in the field of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisational arrangements of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic have undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organizational arrangement of Customs Administration</seg>
<seg id="834">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic since 1.1.2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">DG is the unit of account for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has performed comprehensive excise management since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic also carries out:</seg>
<seg id="838">(a) control:</seg>
<seg id="839">ശശ in the field of road transport (weighing of lorries, payment of road user charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road haulage and in matters of international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">ശശ waste and packaging material management,</seg>
<seg id="841">ശശ safety of imported food,</seg>
<seg id="842">ശശ in the areas of consumer protection and intellectual property</seg>
<seg id="843">ശശ employing foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">(b) customs administration - this is the comprehensive application of customs legislation, commercial policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">(c) the collection and recovery of pecuniary obligations imposed by other public authorities in a divided administration;</seg>
<seg id="846">(d) the activities of the police authority (authorised customs authorities) in proceedings concerning offences committed in breach of customs and related regulations and tax rules, where the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="847">While the scope of the competences (concurrent control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are economies of scale, as the public administration does not have to spend on the status of the control group for each subject of the control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, there is a reduction of the administrative burden on the persons checked by the re-check.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has, since 1.12.2016, exercised the powers to verify compliance with the obligations to register sales (Article 2(2) of Law No 112/2016 Coll., on the Record of Sales) and, from 1.1.2017, the supervision of compliance with the law and the conditions of operation of games of chance, including the imposition of penalties (Article 116 of Law No 186/2016 Coll., on games of chance).</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the project Modernization of Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tiered structure to two-tiered structure with effect from 1.1.2013, with the abolition of the middle article of management (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">The DG spent around CZK 51 million on the project (i.e. around €2,031,000).</seg>
<seg id="852">The Czech Republic's CS since 1.1.2013 has been made up of DGs and county customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competences are determined by law, excise administration is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial workplaces are the internal organisational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is empowered by decree to establish and abolish territorial sites and to determine their material scope.</seg>
<seg id="856">The legislation does not provide for any competences for the territorial workplace; the territorial workplace exercises the competencies of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure until 31.12.2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure since 1.1.2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Management of excise duties until 31.12.2012 was carried out by DGs, eight DCs and 58 CA units (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 unions and units.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1.01.2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the DGs and 51 departments in the CA and its territorial offices, as well as by eight departments in the legal department of the DGs and the CA departments providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.</seg>
<seg id="861">The costs of the CS CR most significantly affect wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">There were no savings in personnel resources as a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the Law on the Service of Security Forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the numbers of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, since under the provisions of Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, they can only be dismissed from the service in cases that are exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of service posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal, and the employer is obliged to ensure that members are assigned adequate service posts within the corps, or to secure service posts with another security corps (e.g. the Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), or else to transfer them to the reserve for the temporarily non-attached, in which the members of the security corps are entitled by law to 80% of the average service income.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organizational arrangement of excise management in SR</seg>
<seg id="868">As part of the Programme Declaration for 2012 to 2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic has set as one of its priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will safeguard additional budgetary resources by aligning tax collection, duties and levies and curbing tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, tax reform was implemented at the central level, resulting in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the SR and the Customs Directorate of the SR into the Financial Directorate of the SR and the creation of a financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">The PŘ SR was set up on 1.1.2012 by Act No 333/2011 of the State Administration on Taxation, Charges and Customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation which has its headquarters in Banska Bystrica and is linked to the State budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">The FŘ SR, the CA and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Z. z., the Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities when they perform tasks under customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Act No 333/2011 of the State Administration in the field of Taxation, Charges and Customs, as amended, together with the Tax Offices, they form a financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competence Centre of Financial Operations, the Tax Offices, the Tax Offices Branch, the Tax Offices Contact Points, the Customs Offices Branch (CA Tax Branch, CA Branch Combined, CA Branch) and Customs Offices Station.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of the FŘ SR is the effective collection and management of taxes and duties, i.e. including excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore for those of the FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organisational structure of the FŘ SR since 1.1.2012 in abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">Within all customs offices in the territory of SR, excise duties management activities and processes are carried out by excise duties departments (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments), in addition to customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations).</seg>

<seg id="883">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organisational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, 74 organisational units, with a total of 1 300 employees, handled excise administration in 2015, in addition to the FŘ SR; almost 48,000 tax entities are managed by these departments.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organisational structure In 2015, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic dealt with the management of excise duties by some 60 organisational units with a total of 1 011 employees, which manage some 114 000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of the various activities of excise administration is divided among several independent personnel services.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their co-ordination and co-operation is addressed through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax inspection) in the field of excise management is divided between the excise department and the customs office branch, within the framework of which the same employees of the tax administration often deal with the said agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In the Slovak Republic, there is about a third of the number of tax entities on the total number of employees in the field of excise administration compared to the Czech Republic; the effect of a higher number of employees on the efficiency of excise administration is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of excisable products, the objective of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to make it possible to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty, and to carry out the prescribed checks.</seg>
<seg id="894">When introducing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to make use of these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of that EP and Council Decision allows the inclusion in the EMCS of national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such technical or software as a Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which operated from May 2004 until the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1.4.2010 and is continuously complemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">A so-called Customs Module and Declarant Module have been introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">Beyond the Community scheme, in the Czech Republic, the EMCS system monitors shipments under the conditional exemption scheme both started and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system provides for the automatic upload of information to the Register of Tax Entities following the approval of the notice of receipt of the shipment intended for the authorised consignee for one-off receipt, with subsequent invalidation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures the administration of both received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELOs, including sending replies with an attachment in any format and providing translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">The report on manual export termination in ECS is also allowed to be accepted (only the referral of an automatically generated message is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS will not permit the approval of an e-AD or a notice of receipt without the response of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The Declarant module is available free of charge for tax entities, in the form of a web application to which the user logs in with the username and password(s) assigned to him after registration with the CS CR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each operation against an EMCS customs module shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declaration Module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and terminated shipments under a conditional exemption scheme, so that tax entities do not have to spend money to acquire the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="911">The declarant module's national functionalities allow data to be retrieved and stored off-line (saving time on frequently used data), filling in recipient data based on the SEED ID check and requiring mandatory completion of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for any consignment dispatched from the Czech Republic to be blocked in real time from securing an excise duty equivalent to the taxable transaction until the time the transport ends.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without a sufficient amount of collateral, the EMCS declarant module is not allowed to send the draft e-AD for approval to CA of dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and contains the transport ARC (including the amount of the blocked collateral) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of the EMCS was realised on the basis of eight contracts with performance from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (or €1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of £43,577,255.19 (or €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT between 2006 and the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">During the audited period, expenditure amounting to CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438.99) was incurred for the EMCS upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on EMCS upgrades during the audited period and converted to one transport entered into EMCS averages 16.49 CZK (or 0.62 €), excluding national transport, this expenditure in terms of one transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States is 24.40 CZK (or 0.92 €).</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, a total amount of technical assistance of CZK 7,499,675 (or €281,389.77) including value added tax was invoiced.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport contributed to the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (or €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">Both the development and technical support invoices related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which DG already operated before EMCS itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were paid in programme funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services as well as other applications provided by the supplier for Customs Administration of the CR.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS v SR</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor movements of excise goods between Member States under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document — SAD, which was used before the system was effective, thereby ensuring better control and management of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="931">It has been in place in the SR since 1.4.2010 and has been continuously supplemented by requirements under EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called</seg>
<seg id="933">An ARC code under which said traffic can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS only ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods by those taxable entities authorised to use the EMCS, thus largely reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest development in functionalities came in 2011, when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of the EMCS has been implemented as an additional module of the SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine on the Slovak side the cost of its initial application.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of EMCS was to replace a system based on the administration of paper-based transport.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefits of EMCS are a comprehensive overview of intra-EU transport between Member States from the announcement of the start of transport to its end, with significant reductions in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities to process, transmit and archive documents.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, a national functionality has been introduced into the EMCS system allowing monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic respectively.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and guarantee of excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">A national functionality is also introduced to monitor the riskiness of the taxpayer or transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="946">SR and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU traffic in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, spending in SR on upgrading this system was €744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO SR only obtained the EMCS upgrade data from the FŘ SR for the period from 2011, although this system had been introduced and operated before.</seg>
<seg id="949">Yet the expenditure incurred for the upgrade of the EMCS system in SR was €188,134.44 more than the expenditure for the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system in about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">During the audited period, the volume of expenditure related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in SR in terms of one shipment is 2.3 times higher than expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic met the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions have acquired a deeper knowledge of the excise management system in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in the two tax systems which affect the efficiency of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">Parallel checks have identified examples of good practice that could contribute to curbing tax fraud, which will grow in importance as tax rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures reducing the cost of excise administration have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons if coordinated due diligence checks are not carried out at the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of the supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel review of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration of 1977 stresses that the supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled to the fullest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers tax as one of the most significant components of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The VIth EUROSAI Congress, held in Bonn in 2005, dealt with SAI audits of public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="7">A major step towards optimising SAI control activity is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is particularly relevant to taxes as the bulkiest source of public revenue, most vulnerable to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of another State's SAI.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in revenue for many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SAIs that carry out inspections in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation between themselves.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was at the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea arose of carrying out a review of the administration of value added tax (VAT) and the VIES system within the framework of cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Careful preparation ensued, with both parties first having to familiarise themselves with the legal environment and procedures for managing VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysis of this information led to a selection of control topics to be included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving an efficient and efficient VAT administration has been a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our scrutiny can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrations, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel controls on the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Object of control:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Value Added Tax Administration after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Target of control:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The objective of the audit operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the exercise of the right to value added tax exemption for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system for checking intra-Community value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">The system of exchange of information on value added tax The auditing actions were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two auditing institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cooperation focused mainly on examining selected business transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany), using information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and comparing the VAT administration systems of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared in the sense of the European Directive No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 31.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel control in the field of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and the German Republic was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Beyond the main point - the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - the control covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the control included the legal situation of international bus passenger services and a comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">Comparing the VAT management systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the primary criterion (among others) for registering is exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, taxpayers are given a tax number when registering for VAT, which only serves for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If a German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, it must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different ways of registering cause problems, conditions should be levelled out across the EU (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport that takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic, taxpayers only submit VAT returns for individual tax years (month or quarter), in Germany, taxpayers are obliged to submit so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and must submit annual VAT returns after the end of the calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike CR payers, payers in Germany are required to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic, payers file summary reports at financial offices, in Germany, payers file summary reports at CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="53">The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have the data from the recapitulative statements immediately after they are filed.</seg>
<seg id="54">The information from the recapitulative statements is only available to the German tax authorities once they have been processed into CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires updated information on intra-Community transactions to be available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements would reduce the time lag between the transaction date and the update of the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="57">This in turn would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">Which would, but would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="59">(5) International VAT Information Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for the information requests received.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not track the elapsed time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the time allowed.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent warning (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).</seg>
<seg id="68">In the framework of cooperation, the two SAIs examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions, carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and the CFN.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or suspicions of VAT evasion were examined using the CLO legislation.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation to calculate the taxpayer's VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="72">In those cases, the payers either improperly claimed exemption from VAT on the supply or failed to declare the acquisition of the goods on the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the financial authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases have been identified where payers have erroneously reported business transactions in summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in VIES was incorrect and the tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Control Action Progress</seg>
<seg id="79">Conduct of the audit operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - the revenue division of the state budget and territorial departments of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter ‘MF’) and 10 tax offices – the Financial Office in Humpolci, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4 the Financial Office in Sokolova and the Financial Office in Thirti.</seg>
<seg id="82">The audit conclusion from this audit event was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Conduct of the inspection operation in the SRN</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Taxation Audit Group and the personnel of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The inspection was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal Ministry in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the testing phase, the review started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to cases selected by BRH and later selected SAIs, BRH had to notify a number of federal states of control.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to the talks at the Federal MF and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhine-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ pro corporations/juridical persons (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Alton, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Innschüd-centr (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-Hampümn-Stadt (Hamburg-Colomnover) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg-Midtown Hamburg)</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, discussions took place with the Augsburg-City Financial Authority (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old City (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A report on the inspection findings was submitted to the I.F. in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">As part of the preparation of the parallel control actions, several meetings of representatives of the two control institutions took place in the period prior to their launch.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants in these meetings were acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislative treatment of VAT issues and the VAT administration system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the subjects of the test phase were agreed upon.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">As part of this meeting, a timetable for further progress of work was agreed and the following themes of parallel controls were identified:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registering taxpayers for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International Bus Carriage of Persons - Legislative Adaptation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrations when handling requests for information and examining selected problem cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and the FRG.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. Tax returns for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical data on the supply and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two parties took note of the progress of the audit in the Czech Republic and the FRC and discussed the results of the parallel audits to date.</seg>
<seg id="111">A report on the results of parallel controls on VAT administration between the Czech Republic and the FRG was prepared at a workshop in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Payers who have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">A taxpayer, under Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter referred to as Act No 337/1992 Coll.), is a taxpayer, a taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person defined as a taxpayer by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">On 1.12.2005 there was an increase in the number of taxable entities registered for VAT to 457 590.</seg>
<seg id="118">A taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a taxable person from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Article 94(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; ("Law 235/2004 Coll.").</seg>
<seg id="119">The person is required to submit an application for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow a taxable person to be registered so-called retroactively in cases where the reason for registration is that the legal limit for registration has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable or VAT-exempt transactions with a right to deduct may become a taxable person, even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), if he fulfils any of the other conditions laid down in Act No 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure under Act No 337/1992 Coll. is initiated by the delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="124">A voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on his VAT registration application the date on which he applies to register as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator shall examine the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed registration form with all annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If it has doubts about the data, it shall invite the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">Once the tax authorities have verified that the taxpayer meets the conditions for registration, they issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the taxpayer is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (‘TIN’).</seg>
<seg id="128">On the certificate, the tax authority shall indicate the effective date of registration for VAT and the periodicity of the tax year for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year has not reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year was CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax year is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year was CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax year and shall notify the tax authority of the change.</seg>
<seg id="132">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the TIN in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the taxpayer is obliged to indicate it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax authority and in cases provided for by a specific law (e.g. Act No 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The TIN contains the code ‘CZ’ and the tribal part, which consists of the general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number or other general identifier, if provided for by a separate law, and for a legal person the identification number (provisions of Section 33(12) of Act No 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the taxpayer has not complied with his registration requirement, even at the request of the tax authorities, the locally competent tax authorities shall register him of their own motion without delay.</seg>
<seg id="137">The outcome of the registration procedure is the issue of the Ex officio Registration Certificate, which is delivered to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is assigned a TIN at the time of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same TIN is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">Pursuant to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., which has been in force since 1.1.2005, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, the tax authorities may impose on the taxable person a refund of up to 10% of the aggregate income or income for taxable transactions which that person has wrongly carried out tax-free, for the period from the date on which he was legally required to be a registered payer until the date on which he became a registered payer by virtue of the tax authority's decision (Paragraph 98(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax payment (Article 98(3) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">The deregistration of the VAT payer, subject to the conditions laid down by law, is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">Withdrawal of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover below the registration limit (§ 106(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer shall be entitled to apply for deregistration at the earliest after 1 year has elapsed from the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2. Withdrawal of registration ‘ex officio’ (Article 106(7) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), if: (a) the payer has not carried out the transactions for 12 consecutive months without notification of the reason to the tax authorities, (b) the payer fails to fulfil his obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">(B) Payees who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who makes a transaction with a place of supply in the Czech Republic and is liable to declare and pay tax on that transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called “non-established payer”) shall become liable on the date on which that transaction takes place.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is required to submit an application for registration to the Tax Office for Prague 1 no later than the date on which the transaction takes place.</seg>
<seg id="149">It is required to indicate in its registration application all TIN allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a ‘non-resident’ payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Tax Office for Prague 1 registers it retroactively because, under Act No 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became liable for VAT on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">When registering retroactively, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires proof from tax entities that the transaction has been performed (invoices and explanatory letters, as appropriate).</seg>
<seg id="152">If the "non-resident" taxpayer applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable transaction takes place, then the Tax Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the transaction will take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">There were 473 "non-resident" payers registered at the Tax Office for Prague 1 on 31.12.2004, out of which 124 payers from the SRN, and 951 "non-resident" payers registered at 31.12.2005, out of which 233 payers from the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to Paragraph 106(9) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., the tax authority is entitled to cancel the registration of a ‘non-resident’ payer on 31 January of the following calendar year, if that payer has not incurred any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">An audit by the SAO found that if a non-resident payer files a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal regulations at the deadline for filing a tax return, it is often not yet available to the tax office on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant to the possibility of de-registration are known to the Tax Office later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic to de-register a non-established taxpayer for VAT in a given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in the SRN</seg>
<seg id="158">In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Sections 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter ‘AO’), anyone carrying on a business activity is required to inform the city/municipal authority or the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the City/Municipal Bureau for the Financial Conduct Authority.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the Financial Conduct Authority identifies an enterprise that has commenced operations but has not registered, the Financial Conduct Authority may register that payer ex officio - and retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both resident and non-resident taxpayers in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria laid down in Paragraph 2 of the German VAT Law (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">That obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they realise.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special finance offices for entrepreneurs permanently resident abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those based in the Czech Republic, the competent Tax Office is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; A total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006.</seg>
<seg id="168">The BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">As work permits for employees from the 10 new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have sought to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way in which they carry out their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to be registered, an entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form which is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by the special departments of the tax authorities or by general departments responsible for assessing taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form provides a risk assessment of each taxpayer before the IRS issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information on the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information on the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last always being a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If a trader intends to engage in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive a tax-exempt intra-Community supply.</seg>
<seg id="178">The CLO will assign a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in the SRN and if he has a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="179">The CLO assigns VAT IDs to entrepreneurs automatically when payers include intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="180">Structure VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur may be revoked: 1. at the request of the entrepreneur (for example, if he has ceased his business activities), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all business years), and 2. if the tax administration becomes aware that he is no longer engaged in business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of a VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of a VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not required to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. in the following year is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small entrepreneurs (‘Kleinunternehmer’) are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not liable to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small businessman may declare that he will not apply the provisions of Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">That return is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The trader can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">There is an option for non-residents to appoint tax representatives (section 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is a prerequisite that they carry out exclusively exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign businessman who thus does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">Information on representation for tax purposes must appear on invoices.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the primary criterion (among others) for registering is exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the taxpayer in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit set, he has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration process is standardized in the SRN, but differences may occur as a result of different organizational models in federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, a payer is assigned a TIN at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same TIN in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the taxpayer is given a tax number when registering for VAT, which only serves for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If a German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, it must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH have found, Germany's two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other member states, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration to intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, a two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax authority about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, a particularly accurate estimate of VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different ways of registering cause problems, conditions should be levelled out across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will allocate the TIN at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This TIN will be valid for the lifetime of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax authority will request an economic TIN to be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on implementing an IT resource to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus passenger services</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the carriage of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct.</seg>
<seg id="216">Such carriage is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by traders who are registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return service is considered to be a separate service.</seg>
<seg id="218">Unless ‘non-established’ tax entities in the Czech Republic carry out other economic activities in addition to international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">The international carriage of persons was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V Cap. 5 paragraph 1 (b), which states:</seg>
<seg id="220">‘For the purposes of Article 28(3)(a), the following definitions shall apply: The Czech Republic may continue to exempt international passenger transport under point 17 of Annex F to the Directive from value added tax until the condition set out in Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier. "</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Section 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place) where the transport takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore makes no distinction between domestic and international cross-border passenger traffic.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also makes no distinction between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through the SRN, the part of the route that takes place in the SRN also constitutes a taxable supply of transportation.</seg>
<seg id="227">The non-resident taxpayer must notify the competent tax office of his intention to provide passenger transport before performing his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office registers this non-taxable person (cf. 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is mentioned in the taxpayer's notice.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is required to declare his taxable supplies of transport on the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Financial Conduct Authority of Chemnitz-Süd had registered 741 Czech payers who were engaged in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">Where passenger transport is provided to a taxpayer liable for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity liable to pay the VAT to the Tax Office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident taxpayer who is the recipient of the services; This process is known as reverse charge and complies with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">Apart from the notification of the non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means of assessing the correctness of the taxable supplies of passenger transport declared.</seg>
<seg id="234">The customs office's mobile control groups audit the certificates of buses licensed (licensed) for foreign transport that are used to carry passengers through the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, the mobile control groups send a check report to the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to claim VAT from the bus driver before continuing the onward journey.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated on his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce its intention to carry out an audit, which must take place in the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if a non-resident taxpayer refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If there is to be a review of the VAT return or of the non-resident taxpayer's obligations, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable supplies of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, auditing the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration has to audit foreign accounting, which means not only a need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than a tax resident's audit, but this is limited to the provision of passenger transport that takes place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer may not only accept the right to carry out a check, which is a matter for his national tax administration, but also the right to be audited by other Member States in which he is carrying passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">Moreover, in any Member State in which only one supply of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations imposed on him in those Member States, in all the languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger traffic therefore generates disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the carriage of persons between individual EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct tax under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport that takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">When such carriage is first provided in Germany by a non-resident payer, he or she is required to give advance notice of the provision of carriage to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare taxable supplies of part of the carriage on the tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are in the passenger transport business.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the effort, the tax take, when realized, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive outcome.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate costs for charging VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider is based.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require modification of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">Tax returns for VAT</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is required to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the GIF within 25 days of the end of the tax year, even if he has not become liable for tax, unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is due by the deadline for filing the VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the importation of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in respect of which the tax liability is determined by the customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a refundable excess arises as a result of the excess deduction being assessed, the payer shall be refunded without request within 30 days of the excess deduction being assessed.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax administration initiates a tax procedure concerning the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with Paragraph 73(11) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct may be exercised on the regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">At the end of that period, the right to deduct may be further exercised within three years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct may have been exercised at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible by filing an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">The amendment to Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force since 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is required to submit a supplementary VAT return if (a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction which does not alter the last known tax liability but only the data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) he makes a correction to the rate and amount of tax pursuant to Article 49 of Law No 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the total of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer is required to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery.</seg>
<seg id="273">Electronic VAT returns can be submitted either via the Internet or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Internet submissions can be made as submissions with a data message bearing an advanced electronic signature or as submissions with a data message not accompanied by an advanced electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of filing with a data message not accompanied by an advanced electronic signature, filing in writing, i.e. delivery of a computer report to the tax authority (e-form), is still required.</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to intra-Community delivery/acquisition values.</seg>
<seg id="277">Service acquisition values are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some of the lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated check within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of supplies of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with the data provided in the summary reports filed by Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">Values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through VIES from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The IRS is running a credibility test on VAT returns under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is automatic, as without the test, VAT returns cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test involves calculating credibility criteria and evaluating risky types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Pursuant to Article 37(1) of Law No 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply within the prescribed period with a non-pecuniary obligation arising under this or a special tax law or imposed by a decision under this law.</seg>
<seg id="285">An automated tax information system used by the FCA to provide technical support for tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities did not make use of the possibility to impose a fine on taxpayers for not submitting a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, a distinction is made between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit provisional VAT returns still have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not liable for VAT have to submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">As a general rule, taxpayers are required to submit their quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which the VAT is incurred (Paragraph 18(2) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the preceding calendar year, or if the business is newly created, the trader concerned is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">A taxpayer may also choose to submit a monthly VAT return if a refund has been made in the past year which has exceeded EUR 6 136 (Paragraph 18(2a) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns need not be made if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant VAT liability amount must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax year in which the VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The tax refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FCA.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no deadlines (by law) for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to have the tax refunded in good time, it may be offered to secure the amount to be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process VAT returns and refund the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">German VAT law provides for the possibility of extending that period (Paragraph 18(6) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows a VAT return to be submitted and the relevant VAT tax liability to be paid a month later, provided that a special advance is paid on the monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the trader cannot correct the erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">A correction of the annual VAT return to or from the payer is possible during the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payees are required to submit their provisional VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via the Internet, with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is made without certification, payers must submit the return once more on paper with their personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">If the payer fails to submit a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the case of late filing, a penalty payment can be imposed on the payer (up to a maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">BRH found during a previous inspection that the IRS often failed to measure this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard penalty therefore fails to meet its objective of reducing the average delay, particularly when filing an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">Service acquisition values are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate tax return/VAT line.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns presented in paper form, a copy must be made either through a scanner or by the staff specifically authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from VAT returns submitted electronically are immediately available to the Financial Conduct Authority.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data has been entered into the system, RMS staff will go through it and make a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">Selected VAT returns must be checked by an IRS official on the basis of a control report prepared by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration has to make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT a taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers submit their VAT returns within 25 days of the end of the tax year.</seg>
<seg id="329">The tax year is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month, depending on the amount of the payer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers file provisional VAT returns, depending on tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">Payers are required to file an annual tax return by May 31 of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="332">There are pros and cons to filing an annual VAT return:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ on the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly provisional) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the payer corrects the admitted intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period covered by the recapitulative statement;</seg>
<seg id="335">– Federal states generally do not compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German payers before processing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with registration (see 4.1.3), German taxpayers are required to submit an annual VAT return, irrespective of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the Tax Office responsible is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and with final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from filed income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are required to submit VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to improving the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The summary report (hereinafter referred to as ‘SH’) is filed under the provisions of Article 102 of Law No 235/2004 Coll. by a payer who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">The data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in Czech currency, broken down by individual tax entities, with their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services rendered are not included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH shall be filed by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of the end of the quarter with the Tax Office, which shall have local jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="348">The correction of erroneous data shall be made in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of detection of the errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">Incorrect data in the SH is always replaced by data in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">Like tax returns, payers can submit the BI in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer does not file SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed it pursuant to Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax authority shall invite him to file it, while informing him of the consequences in the event of failure to file SH or the subsequent SH, namely that the tax authority is entitled under Section 37 of Act No 337/1992 Coll. to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 000 (EUR 67 150) for non-monetary infringements.</seg>
<seg id="352">The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities did not make use of the possibility to impose a fine on payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of the filing of the SH, the tax entities are not sufficiently incentivised to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to file the SH does not affect the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged under Section 102(5) of Act No 235/2004 Coll. to check the data in the SH, where appropriate in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data for determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the event of inconsistencies between the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payer with a monthly tax year) or relevant (payer with a quarterly tax year) VAT return, the tax authority should verify the accuracy of the declared tax liability as stated in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The tax entity removes erroneous data in the SH by filing a subsequent SH itself, or may be required to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct the details of the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the payer fails to demonstrate the data in the SH (or subsequent SH), correcting it by submitting a subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax authority has demonstrated that the information provided by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH is not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator does not substitute the taxpayer's submission by inserting a correction without the submission of a subsequent SH, but merely modifies the information in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from the SH shall be sent to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="362">They can only be sent and received by the national financial administration authority, designated to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Ministry, the International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automated message that the CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Contains all the bad VAT IDs listed in SH's sent lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If a bad VAT ID is used in one of the transmitted normal SH or subsequent SH lines, it is recorded in the table of the bad VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table includes a so-called "Notice of Doubt to VAT ID."</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is required to declare VAT and enter the acquisition values on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of purchased goods declared by a Czech payer on his VAT return and in the value of the goods supplied, as reported by payers from other Member States in their SHs, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax authorities have a duty to investigate irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three situations can arise:</seg>
<seg id="372">(a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant VAT return lines is lower than the value of the supply declared by the EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax authorities will check the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">(b) The difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the EU data (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer will itself submit an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administration to verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return despite this.</seg>
<seg id="377">(c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States stated by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is higher than the value of the goods supplied declared by the EU taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After examining the discrepancy and explaining the causes of its occurrence, the tax authority shall provide the result of the verification to ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the screening are relayed back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">Figure 1 (NB: MF) shows the number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="382">Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities was decreasing for the quarters of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant decrease in numbers occurred in Q4 2005. The CLO has raised the minimum financial limit, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data does not always have to be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of the EU payers, or one resulting from the fact that in individual EU Member States certain types of transactions may be introduced into the SH in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for irregularities in the value of reported transactions found at audited financial offices are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the SRN</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who carry out intra-Community deliveries from the SRN to other EU Member States or engage in triangular transactions are required to submit an SH once every quarter specifying intra-Community deliveries by beneficiary (§ 18a(1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">SH must be administered by the 10th day of the month following the corresponding calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this time limit is allowed in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be supplied by CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be allowed by the relevant tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realise that erroneous data are given in the SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that the taxpayers do not file with the SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to compel the submission of this report.</seg>
<seg id="396">This procedure includes: – a first reminder – a second reminder linked to the threat of a fine/penalty payment, and – an assessment of the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, amounting to EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a(1) No 5 of the UStG provides that payers are to act unlawfully if, intentionally or negligently, they fail to submit them properly to the SH, file them incomplete, fail to file them on time or, if they fail to repair or repair the SH late at all.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office as the processing of SHs is the sole task of CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data is stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from the SH are therefore only visually available to the Financial Conduct Authority after processing into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing the SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Data from SH must be stored during the three months following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">If incorrect VAT IDs are provided in the SH of German payers, the CLO will receive O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks them for the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If CLOs fail to obtain correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">BRH found during the check that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID at CLO's request.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within a month or two.</seg>
<seg id="412">The IRS rejected exemptions for reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the Financial Conduct Authority asked him to submit a corrected SH to the CLO, as the Financial Conduct Authority could not correct the VIES data on its own.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so payers often did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">In view of the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before the submission of those data to the CLO of other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually used in the preparation of a VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States are processed into CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then presented to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">This data is used for the purpose of checking acquisitions by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once entered into the system, the CLO rechecks them based on a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), audit information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is produced later and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the assessment process will then cross-check these data with intra-Community acquisition data.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall submit the SH within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the Tax Office, which has local jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities process the SH and transfer the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, declared by the payers in the SH, are compared at the tax offices with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State indicated by those payers in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used within the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In SRN, payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to submit quarterly SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers have been filing CLOs, since 1.1.2007, in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities only have the information from SH after processing it into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Both CR and SRN payers report only the supply of goods in the SH, the supply of services is not mentioned in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are unable to correct erroneous lines filed by SH on their own.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to German VIES data, the erroneous VAT IDs were not corrected, even if the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FC.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the figures for intra-Community supplies given in the German taxpayer's VAT return and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of the two statements are usually not detected before the German CLO provides data from VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Given the BRH findings, it is clear that a comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on supplies of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on acquisitions of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">Comparison is conducted by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are referred to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in taxpayers' tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax authority controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if the RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is destined for control anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This approach relieves the tax authorities of the need to clarify the reasons for any difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Tackling carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers administer the SH on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, since most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file VAT returns on a monthly basis – and the SH does not require any additional information as opposed to a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">To avoid bureaucratic costs, filing a SH may involve filing a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, an obligation to administer SH on a monthly basis would cause more time mismatches between the reporting of intra-community delivery and intra-community procurement and could increase the flow of data between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">The German federal government considered a general provision of monthly SHs in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed because of federal doubts.</seg>
<seg id="455">These were concerned that the monthly submission of data from VIES to other Member States' CLOs could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the monthly SH submission and monthly data transmission obligations were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European monthly SH standard.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In foreign trade, the CFN represents the Czech Republic's most important trading partner.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods made between the CR and the SRN are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TIN or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL messages transmitted between the CR and the SRN for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These figures are set out in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">Level 3 international information exchange</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">International exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States regarding intra-Community trade transactions and the payers who have carried out those transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information upon request shall take the form of so-called requests for information (RFIs), using the standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax Administrators from the Czech Republic send their ZhOI or replies to received ZhOI through the financial directorates at the CLO, which provides for the translation of the information provided on the SCAC standardised forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also provides for the receipt of the YEI from other Member States and replies to the transmitted YEI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the locally competent tax authorities for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets the maximum time limit for processing an RFID at 3 months from receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO audits were carried out on all YES, transmitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the 94 YEARS recruited in the Czech Republic from the SRN, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month deadline, a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline, and the remaining 1 were not sent to the SRN by the time of the SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">Figure 2 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which replies to the RU received from the SRN were sent from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the 335 YEARS sent from the Czech Republic to the German Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) were answered within the three-month deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) were not answered by the time of the SAO audit by the SRN (in the remaining 1 cases, it was not possible to determine when the SRN response was received from the transmitted data).</seg>
<seg id="477">Figure 3 provides more detailed information on the deadlines by which the replies to YES sent to the SRN were received in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage expression of the intra-Community transaction values reported in the GI transmitted between the CR and the SRN is included in Chart 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the chart above, the value of commercial transactions, examined through the RBI, was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">International exchange of information without prior request takes the form of either an automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or a spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax authorities from other Member States are often provided without prior request with information that may be relevant to them in administering VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The information shall be transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">‘Automatic exchange’, according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" then means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax authorities from the Report form for the delivery of the new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the tax document issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing the aforementioned form, the tax administrator shall fill in the necessary data in a specially created template and forward it in turn to the liaison officer at the Financial Directorate where the data are collected and transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States within a specified time frame, i.e. not later than two months after the end of the quarter in which the information was available.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions that appear to be unauthorised and information on potential missing traders.</seg>
<seg id="490">That information shall be sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using an SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Conduct of international information exchange in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In the SRN, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax office.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by email directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">Financial authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information audited by BRH were sent in order to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State, or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable basis for such a request, the German CLO will reject any request containing an amount lower than that fixed limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer a request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant IRS, pointing to a three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no further deadlines for processing requests at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past deadlines, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to the response to blank requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or conducting an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only cover one transaction that has been carried out recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and ﬂexible type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has proven its utility in investigating individual taxable transactions.</seg>
<seg id="505">Under the automatic exchange without prior request, the SRN provides other Member States with information – on VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States, – on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, the SRN committed to provide other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID; b. shipping or catalogue sales in other Member States not taxable in the SRN; c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States; d. intra-Community supply of goods not declared by the German payer in the SH because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions; e. potential "missing trader" who carried out their intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID; f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or to those VAT recipients.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">In both the CR and the SRN, local tax authorities initiate the submission of YEI or spontaneous information and send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech-English) and translates the information sent into English and German respectively, the German tax authorities follow the instruction that they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on the monolingual form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">Examination of the RUs transmitted between 1.5.2004 and 31.12.2005 between the CR and the SRN found that the Czech tax administration had completed 74.5% of the applications received within the three-month time limit, while the RUs sent to the SRN were only processed by the German tax administration in 40.6% of the cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO alerts the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of missing notifications is a large number of late replies to YES.</seg>
<seg id="515">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended a regular alert to CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, the German CLO is now alerting the tax authorities to answer unfinished answers to the Yi.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several departments at different organisational levels of the tax administration deal with VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the IFI, the following services deal with risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT Methodology and Performance Unit and a report within it VAT risk management, which, among other things, manages the risk selection of possible tax evasion and assesses trends of such risks at both national and Community levels.</seg>
<seg id="523">Coordinates the operation of the job nationwide The credibility of VAT tax returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on trade balance data, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, processes conceptually the management of VAT risks and cooperates with relevant EU institutions and other Member States in this field.</seg>
<seg id="525">The International VAT Management Cooperation Unit, which inter alia ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses VIES data from other Member States, ensures public awareness and provides other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TIN or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL messages transmitted between the CR and the SRN for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These figures are set out in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLOs relate their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">Unit Tax Control and Search Methodologies, which inter alia performs risk analysis in the methodological management of tax controls and, in line with risk analysis, sets priorities for targeting tax controls in the plans of the Financial Directorates, processes risk analyses in the context of tax evasion reduction, including the collection of lessons learned from tax administration as well as from other sources, and proposes measures to curb tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Search departments are set up in the finance directorates to carry out, inter alia, searches of tax entities and areas at risk of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceuticals), searches of unregistered tax entities in terms of the risks of tax evasion (e.g. internet services, job placement, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of the links of chain fraud and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialised control units are set up at the selected 12 financial offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence, tax controls outside the territorial competence of the tax authorities are carried out by delegation.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up a specialist tax inspection unit has arisen from the mounting findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which are mainly found in entities linked to the chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities, and multinationals and tax entities with a large scale of activity in terms of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms have been integrated into the ADIS system to limit VAT risks: – the role of the Trustworthiness of VAT returns, used to assess the riskiness of tax returns filed, – the role of the Selection of Tax Entities to Control, enabling the collection of taxpayer checks on the basis of the chosen criteria, – the role of the VIES, through which tax authorities have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The VIES role allows, among other things: – to check the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States, – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, – to generate a report of payers who have not filed the SH, – to carry out a formal check of the data supplied by the CR payers in the SH before sending those data to other Member States, – to generate a report of payers where the data on the supply of goods to other Member States stated in the VAT returns do not tally with the VAT returns of Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their activity to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax authorities have access to registers of government departments such as the Commercial Register, Land Register, Motor Vehicle Register, Business Register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">For more detailed information, see Chapter 4.4.1 Reporting and Processing of Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in the SRN</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal (federal) structure of the SRN, the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the CLO level, ST I 2 (‘KUSS’) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a special database called the OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has set up a new database called ZAUBER designed to transmit the names of companies of tax fraudsters as "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of domestic and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, the specialists of several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with RMS-related duties and powers.</seg>
<seg id="549">A formal check on the composition of other Member States' VAT IDs in the SH filed by German payers is introduced at CLO level.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out before the SH data are provided to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Validation of the VAT IDs in the SH is done on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the process of correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS on the CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control reports based on several characteristics that typically feature in so-called carousel trading operations to identify potential missing traders.</seg>
<seg id="553">The federal tax authorities are instructed to process these inspection reports and, in some cases, report on the results of their findings to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case (instead of an exclusive focus on the company's turnover) is to be presumed with sufficient probability.</seg>
<seg id="555">BRH therefore proposed that MF take into account different characteristics when processing the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should also sanction other facts, such as a taxpayer's payment behaviour (morality), industry (economic activity) or shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of the RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and focused on the processing of VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">RMS, for example, generates a list of those payers who have reported intra-Community delivery in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions, reported in the payer's annual VAT return, with VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the federal states try to avoid comparing quarterly data because such comparisons would reveal too much disapproving data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">- different execution times for an intra-community transaction in the view of the supplier on the one hand and the recipient on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">– Different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (incentives) and their different presentation on the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and VIES, many federal states have introduced elements of RMS that are based on VAT return data and some other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, number of employees and payment behaviour/taxpayer morality).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (risk managers) to program their own rules for singling out potential tax fraud perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">Accordingly, the competent tax authority will receive a recommendation made by the RMS before setting VAT.</seg>
<seg id="568">Because this RMS is not able to reflect current findings in its operations, risk managers have to adjust the relevant rules based on financial authority feedback.</seg>
<seg id="569">The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania administrative district programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which a check revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to identify the characteristics of the tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The RMS produces a monthly list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for decisions on auditing proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">Following the audit, auditors must report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The North Rhine-Westphalia administrative district uses an adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data of VAT returns under consideration and some other facts, this neuron-fuzzy system or data-mining system calculates the likelihood that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraud offenders.</seg>
<seg id="577">The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers to check and report the findings of the check to the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The roll-out of one of the three RMS in the other Länder is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">As none of the three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful to tackle tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of the SRN, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">New trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud are currently being discussed by the tax authorities of EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - is proving not to be a national problem, but rather a European one.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in multiple states.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">A VAT loss caused by EU fraud may not hit the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State that is involved in fraudulent activities can be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be a European exchange and discussion of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">In the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel control actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and the FRG.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two control institutions jointly examined the execution of several commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or inconsistencies in the way in which the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions on their VAT and VAT returns respectively.</seg>
<seg id="595">The SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving business transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities at the request of BRH.</seg>
<seg id="596">In 43 cases, the SAO checked the values of intra-Community transactions with the SRN reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH, based on the BRH warning.</seg>
<seg id="597">BRH examined a total of 23 cases at the SAO's request, relating to business transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">Examination of the selected cases found, among other things, that a different way of registering in the EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should have purchased EUR 60 500 worth of goods from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">Since the Czech taxpayer declared the acquisition of goods only worth the equivalent of EUR 29 869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the goods supplied.</seg>
<seg id="603">In a reply to the RU received from the SRN, the German side stated that in Q2 2004 a German payer delivered goods worth EUR 27 381 to a Czech payer, EUR 31 997 in Q3 and EUR 10 276 in Q4 2004.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply further showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been valid since 28.9.2004, but the German CLO retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate of validity from 1.5.2004 in 2006 following an additional request from the German payer for a VAT ID certificate of validity.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer made a correction to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">The Czech payer, on the basis of this information, was the acquirer of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">The SAO's enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had submitted additional VAT returns for the various tax years of 2004, in which he had increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States while claiming the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, it was not possible for the Czech tax authorities to determine unequivocally from these additional VAT returns whether the values of supplies from the German supplier mentioned above were also included.</seg>
<seg id="609">BRH discovered, as requested by the SAO, that a German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not request a VAT ID when registering, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is not usually possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID to a payer retroactively, in this case a German tax official in 2006 assigned a VAT ID to the German payer referred to above retroactively as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO assigns a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by a CLO after the payer's request for a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, CLO allocates VAT IDs retroactively because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">Conversely, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to report intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these different procedures between the Member States, the German CLO assigned VAT IDs retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authorities asked for the registration of a German taxpayer for VAT to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="618">The VIES indicated the date of registration as 5.3.2005, with the date of 1.10.2004 on the registration certificate for the German payer issued by the competent German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a reply received from the SRN, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1.10.2004, but the VAT ID was not provided to it in the SRN for organisational reasons until 16.2.2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administration found that the Czech tax administration had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxpayer for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">With this check, the tax office found that the Czech payer had included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German payer before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax year of Q3 2004, the tax office charged VAT to the taxpayer in the amount of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">BRH found out, as requested by the SAO, that the German payer was not assigned the VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when he informed the IRS of his business, which he started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the filing of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer declared an intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. £5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech payer declared a supply of goods worth 114 615 CZK (3 642 euro) to the German payer in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="627">The Czech tax authority, when verifying the registration of a German payer in the VIES system, found that his registration was valid from 11.11.2004, i.e. only after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer filed an additional DAP for VAT, in which he declared the taxable amount of the transactions effected within the country, worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and the VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692) which he had paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO enquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer had subsequently submitted a request for a retrial in respect of the additional VAT return and provided as evidence confirmation by the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">That is why the Czech tax authorities verified the validity of the German payer's registration in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from the German Government showed that the VAT ID was not allocated to the German payer until 11.11.2004, i.e. after the date on which the goods were delivered.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administration in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that this was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods because the German payer had obtained the VAT ID only on 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on that acquisition by claiming a refund of input tax of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, as there would have been no changes in the value of the VAT payable by the German taxpayer, the tax authorities in Germany did not correct the figures in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH further found that the name of the German payer, given in the RGI, had been changed during the processing of the reply in the SRN, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">In the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 for a value of EUR 22 686 from a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">The SAO enquired the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that this administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, verifying that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had accounted for and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of the goods on the VAT return because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the application of VIES, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21.4.2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax authority asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the registration certificate for the German payer so that, if necessary, it could take steps to assess the tax.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Tax Office assessed the transaction in question as an acquisition of goods from a non-payer of the FRG and therefore did not charge the Czech payer the tax retrospectively on that transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for an intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only has to have the VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and be able to prove that the goods are transported to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">Under the German VAT law, it was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any event, it is important that the Czech tax authorities noticed this transaction, as the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to the YEI concerning intra-Community transactions of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased EUR 12 561 worth of goods from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax authority carried out a tax audit on the taxpayer for this tax year.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax authorities, using the SCAC form, to verify the delivery of those goods.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied acquiring the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods was not accounted for in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the requirement to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, arguing that the turnover did not exceed the value of EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory reasoning was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax authorities did not obtain evidence to assess the tax on the goods acquired, they ended the tax inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (§ 22 a – e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer declared these deliveries in his annual VAT return and in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was granted the right to free delivery.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the BRH's warning, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the supporting documents needed to assess the tax on the purchased goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in Chapter 4.6.1 of the reply to the JOI sent from the SRN to the Czech Republic, they exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the answers from the Czech Republic to the SRN: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO's audit found that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to the SRN on 5.10.2005 regarding the verification of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer declared a supply of goods to the Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in the SH for this period, but the Czech payer declared in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 35 314 in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In its reply to the ŽOI, received in the Czech Republic on May 9, 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the application could not be processed as the German firm's operations had ceased at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">By failing to comply with the deadline for processing the ŽOI, the German tax administration did not have the necessary documents for the tax procedure in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator applied through the SCAC form for verification of the delivery of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to a German payer, made in Q3 and Q4 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that there had been no response to YES from the SRN by the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also found, by enquiry with the local tax authority, that the Czech taxpayer had not included in the VAT return the supply of new means of transport for the German taxpayer, worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech Tax Administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech Tax Entity filed the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that for technical reasons the German CLO had not forwarded the above mentioned ZhOI to the local tax office for verification.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the BRH warning, a check was carried out at the German acquirer's office in Germany, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the cars in question had been sold to the next payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased a passenger car from the German payer in the 4th quarter of 2004 for a value of EUR 48 500.</seg>
<seg id="672">The acquisition of these goods was not acknowledged by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">An enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax returns were not filed by the Czech taxpayer even after calls from the tax administration, so on 23 May 2005 the tax office charged him VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2.6.2005 CLO drew attention to the abovementioned supply from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax authorities, the tax authorities sent the ŽOI to the SRN, concerning the aforementioned supplies.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to the JOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7.2.2007, it was not known until the end of the audit of the SAO how the Czech tax administration used the information obtained by the international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">On 23 August 2005, the tax office revoked the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer on account of his failure to comply with the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial reply was sent to the RU, as the audit carried out by the tax authorities on the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax authorities requested through the SCAC form a verification of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to a German payer, made in the third quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In its reply to Zhoei, the German tax authorities stated that they had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for a delivery of EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">BRH found, as requested by the SAO, that the audit carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser of the SRN had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in tax returns for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, an examination of the delivery of cars to a German payer worth EUR 198 167, made in Q4 2004 and QI 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the JOI to the Czech Republic in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation into the SRN had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that several local investigations were carried out at the Czech contractor's premises by the local tax office in order to verify the use of excess VAT deductions, which did not identify any undue drawings.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer had declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 during that period and that the check carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intra-community acquisition values given by the recipient in the tax return and those given by the supplier in its SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not the time lag or the misrepresentation of the value of intra-Community supplies of goods in the SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">In Q1 2005, according to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German payer, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax authorities and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax authorities requested, in the framework of an international exchange of information, to verify how the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The reply to the RU from the SRN showed that the German tax administration had established that the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the contracted carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false certificate of payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After discovering fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO enquired at the local tax office in the Czech Republic and found that, based on information obtained, the tax administrator had charged the Czech taxpayer VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">BRH confirmed, as requested by the SAO, that the German supplier had reported only EUR 7,916 worth of supplies to the Czech payer after repairs.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected values of the goods and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus, his SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities requested through the SCAC form to verify the supply of goods and services made in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth a total of EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that a local investigation had been carried out by the Czech tax administration to verify this supply with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="707">In reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer supplied the German payer with a production line including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">Individual parts of the production line were supplied by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic joined the EU, and after 1.5.2004 the line was assembled on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because it claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for the amounts of EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer took the invoices issued but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO also discovered that all invoices are properly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer by enquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="713">Only the amounts evidenced by the Czech payer and relating to invoicing after 1.5.2004 are shown in the VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that, based on a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax office in Germany concluded that the transaction in question was a supply of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer, including services for assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of the so-called fulfilment of work is where the assembly of the production line took place.</seg>
<seg id="716">Under German VAT law, the German recipient of the service supplied is liable to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim a VAT deduction on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT payable by the German taxpayer, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. In February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth €58,000 from German payer C, according to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax authority sent a request to the FRG to verify this supply.</seg>
<seg id="721">In reply to the Yi, the German side stated that this machine had already been delivered by German payer C to Czech payer B in 2004, but that this machine was to be returned to German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to the SRN, but was transported to the organization of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, the reply to the request for information showed that the German payer C had sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organization of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since the delivery was made only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO enquired from the tax administration of the local payer B and found that according to VIES, German payer C delivered goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027 to Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax authority from the Czech Republic sent the RU to the FRG.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to that request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">Further investigation with payer B found that the machine, worth EUR 88 027, was not in payer B's accounts, and that it could be a machine of the same type as that supplied by the organisation of German payer C to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator of the local tax payer A carried out a local investigation on this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax authorities had at their disposal an invoice from German payer C dated 7.2.2005, which identified payer A as the purchaser of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech Tax Administrator found that Payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Payer A had a lease agreement with another Czech company where the subject of the lease was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9.2.2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax office to establish the tax liability of Payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that German payer C did not deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was not therefore an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax authorities did not grant C, the German taxpayer, a VAT exemption and corrected the figures in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D supplied the machine to Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under German law, that supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, BRH found that German payer C reported in its SH for QI 2005 the delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">That supply was not verified during a tax audit carried out by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO's audit of the accepted ŽOI found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from the FRG on 4.10.2005, in which the German tax administration requested verification of an intra-Community supply from a German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax authorities, there was a suspicion that this was a sham intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">It was further stated in the RBI that the German payer had not engaged in any active commercial activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administration had carried out a local investigation on the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the observations of the manager of the Czech company, the aforementioned case appears to have involved a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax authorities, which was claimed by the Czech taxpayer as a partner in a German company with the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administration has no information to date that the issue related to the Czech payer has been addressed by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, yet the value is still included in VIES as an intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech payer from the FRG.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not report intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the VIES data, the German payer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech payer in Q3 2004 to QI 2005. The Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administration has requested verification of the supply of goods from the FRG as part of an international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to that request, the German tax authorities stated that the German payer had sent some of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods being collected by the Czech payer himself.</seg>
<seg id="757">An inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic revealed that even before receiving the reply to the ŽOI, the Czech payer had submitted additional VAT returns for the periods mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in acquisition values have not been resolved, so the Czech tax authorities recommended a tax audit of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The check has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. The German payer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004 as reported in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="761">The Czech payer only granted intra-Community acquisitions for the same period of EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax authority requested verification in the framework of the international exchange of information of the value of the supplies made.</seg>
<seg id="763">The reply to the JOI, received from the SRN, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total declared value of the delivery of the goods of EUR 31 999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="764">The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic revealed that after receiving the reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech taxpayer's accountant and agreed with her to discuss the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004, after examining these invoices with the company owner.</seg>
<seg id="765">No additional VAT return has yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech Tax Administrator told the SAO that it would proceed further to meet the deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">The German payer was due to deliver EUR 11,600 worth of goods to the Czech payer in Q4 2004.</seg>
<seg id="769">In an international exchange of information, the German tax authorities asked for confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed, as the alleged partner of the German payer had set up more fictitious companies in the SRN.</seg>
<seg id="770">When examining the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to the Czech payer, the goods were not shipped from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted sales notes for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, neither declared nor paid the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic nor in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts suggested tax evasion within the territory of the FRG and were communicated by the Czech tax administration to the German tax administration in its reply to the GI.</seg>
<seg id="775">The SAO's enquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic revealed that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, including the value of the acquisition of goods from, inter alia, the German taxpayer, while claiming the right to deduct tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">He did not enter VAT on the sale of goods in Germany on the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administration assessed the additional VAT return unchanged following a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to Czech legislation, that case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administration therefore made the wrong conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer's tax return immediately after receiving a reply to the ŽOI in which it was stated that the goods had not left the FRG and demanded VAT from him in the amount of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the relevant tax authority has sent a notice to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods is correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, payers reported intra-community transactions that were unlikely to actually occur:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax authority received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from a German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">Attached to the application was a copy of the Czech payer's VAT registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="786">In addition, a copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, was to carry out the transfer of that car was attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">An investigation by the Czech tax authorities found that this was a stolen passport, the person named therein had not imported any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was included by the Czech tax authorities in their reply to the ZhOI, together with a statement that they could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">The SAO's inquiry with the local tax administration in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company's manager was uncontactable.</seg>
<seg id="791">The Czech tax authority, following the complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax year, assessed the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="792">Further investigation by the Czech tax authorities found that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which had bought it through an advertisement on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the locally competent German tax authority, on the basis of the Czech answer to the ZhOI, would not recognise the German payer's entitlement to the VAT exemption for that supply.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3 000 between the value of the goods acquired declared on the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was disclosed that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 89 424 to the German payer during QIV 2004 to QI 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax authorities requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax administrator stated in his reply to the ŽOI that the only female manager of the Czech company had been removed from the Commercial Register on 8.7.2005 and the new manager had not been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods appeared to be a relative of a Czech company partner.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed tax returns for both VAT and SH, which were signed by an unauthorised person – that partner of the firm – after the agent was erased from the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The Czech taxpayer's accountant confirmed to the tax authority that the company's partner had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the tax administrator had recognised the Czech payer's right to VAT exemption for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the delivery of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for the first quarter of 2005 of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax authorities in Germany had failed to correct the German acquirer's VAT return because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the German payer's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since an earlier check revealed no evidence of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax liability assessed.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to data in VIES, a German payer purchased goods worth €4,251,196 from the Czech Republic in 2005 after acquiring goods worth €43,274 the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In both the 2004 tax return and the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not report intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="807">It also failed to report adequate supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these differences, the German Tax Office sent a YEI, covering Q4 2005 and Q1 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods to a German payer in the SH for these two quarters, totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6.9.2006, the ŽOI was received, in which the German side asked to verify that the intra-Community deliveries declared by the Czech payer had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the request of the German side could not be met because the Czech payer had no manager.</seg>
<seg id="812">As is clear from the materials provided to the SAO by the competent tax authority, a report was drawn up with the Czech taxpayer's manager on the start of the VAT inspection for Q4 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax authorities to produce all accounting and tax documents for the aforementioned periods, but no documents were produced.</seg>
<seg id="814">The sole agent of the Czech payer ceased to hold office on 16 May 2006, according to the Commercial Register, and the new director was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has stopped submitting VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the audit, the SAO, in cooperation with BRH, also examined several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases reviewed was transmitted between the two supreme audit institutions through the CLOs of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany has informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received the German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) has accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms in the name, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to a lack of own capacity, the Czech company passed part of the order to a German payer (eD) based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relationships and mode of transport of wind farms:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the location of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– A Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind farms to be assembled under his name, at his risk and his account in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the installation of that supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own behalf, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the beneficiary is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not receive an exemption because the other Member State of destination differs from the other Member State of residence of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The delivery location of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transportation.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The delivery of those wind farms, which are produced in the Czech Republic, took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– Supply of other wind farms that are produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not declare any intra-Community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany or submit the SH to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it's possible that the Czech company reported all intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that the (eCR) did not report any intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">An examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case shows no sign of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the SAO and BRH examined the transactions to highlight the differences between the reporting in the tax return and the VIES data, which were due to different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that changes to the legislation take time to implement the new legislation by both the payers and the tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In the SH for Q4 II-IV 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-Community deliveries to the German payer for a total value of CZK 792 977 452 (EUR 25 197 885).</seg>
<seg id="841">Over the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intra-Community delivery to another German payer for a total value of 18,157,265 CZK (576,970 euro).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers listed the above supplies in the SH in accordance with the text of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">Further examination of the above transactions, the auditing group found that in 2004 there were differences between the CR and the FRG in the legal arrangements for the supply and purchase of electricity respectively.</seg>
<seg id="845">Whereas in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the applicable text of Act No 235/2004 Coll. as an intra-Community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community acquisition but a taxable transaction with a place of performance in the territory of the German Federal Republic.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in statutory regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic with the adoption of Act No 635/2004 Coll. amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Administrative Fees Act, effective from 1.1.2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. Furthermore, when examining selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported in the SH for Q1-4 2005 intra-Community deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 240 411 163 (EUR 8 071 823) and another Czech payer reported in the SH for the same period intra-Community deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 263 470 776 (EUR 8 846 050).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">Pursuant to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force since 1.1.2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of performance is the place where the customer has his registered office, place of business or has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have declared the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">By reporting intra-Community supply of electricity in SH, the two payers mentioned above distorted data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation fulfilled the objectives of the BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs have acquired a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the VAT administration legislation differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were identified during parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to check out afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">Based on the audit findings, the two SAIs made recommendations on VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration checks.</seg>
<seg id="861">Communiqué</seg>

<seg id="3">The submitted joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel controls carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky, aimed at the management of excise duties in the period after the accession of the two countries to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was carried out on the basis of a contract for cooperation in control activities, concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel controls was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system for collecting excise duties which has taken place in the context of the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union since 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the European Union's internal market requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow goods not subject to tax to circulate until the day they are delivered for final consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with that principle, the new legislation, adopted in both countries, allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on tax administrations and foresees close interaction between the competent administrations of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation on controls of excise administration for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Check Number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of inspection: (Czech Republic) Excise Management (SR) Procedure of colné orgánov pri správe spotrebá tax</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO-CR) and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded on 8 February 2006 the ‘Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activity’.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel checks ‘Administration of Excise Duties’, included in the SAO-CR's 2005 audit work plan under No 05/34, and ‘Control of the progress of colné orgánov in administering rebrebrebrebrebate taxes’, included in the SAO SR's 2006 audit work plan under No 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel checks were in the nature of coordinated checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information that could not be obtained by the contracting parties when checking the management of excise duties on their national territory and producing a joint final report on the outcome of the checks within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards - Directive No 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the territory of the Czech Republic, control groups from the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia carried out inspections between 7 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">27 inspectors were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="20">The persons audited were the Directorate General of Customs (DG) and 11 tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Within the DG, 12 selected customs offices were audited out of a total of 54.</seg>
<seg id="22">The audit in the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘SR’) was carried out by the Finance and Tax Office of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the expositories of the SAO of Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 between 13 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">Eight inspectors were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">The aim of the parallel controls was to examine the customs authorities' handling of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">International cooperation has focused on the procedure of tax administrations in exercising supervision over the transport of excise goods, in particular on the registration of commenced and completed shipments under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">2. Excise management</seg>
<seg id="27">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by financial authorities until 31 December 2003.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken up by customs authorities, who have hitherto levied excise duty only on imports.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="30">The state budget's revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic totalled CZK 82.8 billion in 2004, and excise taxes accounted for 19.5% of the state budget's revenue from taxes and duties of CZK 424.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2005, the State budget revenue from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the State budget revenue share from taxes and duties amounted to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2004, the revenue from excise duty on mineral oils to the national budget was 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it was 90.9%.</seg>
<seg id="33">The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund of Transport Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of all excise duties in the SR has been carried out by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, which they have administered since 1 January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">Until then, excise duties were administered by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="36">Excise duty in the SR is levied on mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="37">The State budget's revenue from excise duties in the Slovak Republic totalled EUR 43.4 billion in 2004 and accounted for 20.7% of total tax revenue of EUR 209.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2005, the government budget revenue from excise duties was 50 billion units and the total tax revenue was 222.6 billion. The excise taxes accounted for 22.5%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Graph 1 — Comparison of state budget revenue of the Czech Republic from taxes and fees and tax revenue of the state budget of the Slovak Republic with revenue from excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="40">- Council Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (hereinafter referred to as 'Directive 92/12/EEC'), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation No 2073/2004'), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the accompanying official document for the movement of products subject to excise duty under excise duty exemption (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation No 2719/92'), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92/EEC for movement of products subject to a simplified movement within a Member State.</seg>
<seg id="41">The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No 353/2003 Coll., on excise duties, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as Act No 353/2003 Coll.) in force from 1 January 2004.</seg>
<seg id="42">In administering excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding provisions: - Act No 98/2004 on the spot tax on mineral oil in the pollution of non-mineral predpissoffs (hereinafter referred to as “Act No 98/2004 Z. z.”); - Act No 104/2004 Z. z. z. o. on the spot tax on wine in the pollution of non-mineral predpissos (hereinafter referred to as “Act No 104/2004 Z.

<seg id="43">2.1 Movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement between Member States of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="44">The conditions of movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement are governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods Articles 15 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="45">Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be effected only by an authorised warehousekeeper, who means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="46">A consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not store or re-dispatch such products under a suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="47">Authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic means a tax warehouse operator, economic operator is an authorised consignee for repeated or one-off acceptance of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="48">Under Directive 92/12/EEC, the movement of products subject to excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement is only possible with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the transport begins, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch require a further copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure for the start and end of the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="51">Transport from CR</seg>
<seg id="52">The procedure for commencing transport is governed by Section 25, paragraph 3 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="53">‘The tax warehouse operator shall, before commencing the transport of selected products, inform the customs office which is the local competent tax warehouse from which the transport is to commence;</seg>
<seg id="54">transport of selected products may only commence with the approval of this customs office.</seg>
<seg id="55">The customs office shall give its consent for the transport of the selected products without delay after the condition of securing the tax has been fulfilled ..."</seg>
<seg id="56">The sender in the Czech Republic can start transport of all types of products subject to excise duty only with the consent of the local competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="57">The customs office shall give its consent to the commencement of the transport only if security of tax in the amount of tax attributable to the products transported is provided.</seg>
<seg id="58">The consignor shall draw up an accompanying document in five copies before commencing transport.</seg>
<seg id="59">The customs office shall indicate on the accompanying document the consent to commence transport.</seg>

<seg id="66">Chart 2 — Circulation of the accompanying document for transport started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="67">Transport from SR</seg>
<seg id="68">The procedure for transporting alcohol and tobacco products from SR to another Member State of the European Union was modified until 31 December 2005 as follows:</seg>
<seg id="69">Pursuant to Article 26(4) of Law 105/2004 Z.z.</seg>
<seg id="70">‘Pri preprave liehu from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to a lawful beneficiary, alebo to a tax splnomocnencovi v inom členskom štáte je odosielatel’ (the deliverer’) the obligatory on the day before atia prepravy to send a kópiu of the first dielu sprievodného document electronically alebo faxom Colný úradu Poprad; tAttack kópiu is obligatory to send also colý úradu písomne to the piatich of the working days odo dňa beg a prepravy.

<seg id="71">Pursuant to Article 22(4) of Act No 106/2004 Z.z.</seg>
<seg id="72">‘Pri preprave tabak productions from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to a lawful beneficiary, alebo tax splnomocnencovi v inom členskom štáte je odosielatel’ (the supplier) obligated in the present day to send a kópiu of the first dielu sprievodný Document electronically alebo faxom Colný úradu Poprad; tAttack kópiu is obligatory to send a colaj úradu písomne najor na piatich working days odo dňaňa bega prepravy. "</seg>
<seg id="73">When transporting other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 (‘the period under scrutiny’), the taxpayer was under no obligation to notify the customs office Poprad or the competent customs office of the commencement of transport under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="74">It was only during a local investigation or a tax inspection that the tax authorities became aware of the transport of these products from the accompanying documents and the taxpayer's accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="75">The consignor in SR shall draw up the accompanying document in four copies before commencing transport.</seg>
<seg id="76">Copy No 1 shall be kept by the consignor (when transporting alcohol and tobacco products, he shall send a copy of Copy No 1 electronically or by fax to the customs office Poprad and the competent customs office).</seg>
<seg id="77">Copies Nos 2, 3 and 4 shall accompany the goods being transported.</seg>
<seg id="78">Under Czech law, the consignee in the Czech Republic keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document drawn up by the consignor in the Slovak Republic and acknowledges receipt of the products on copies No 3 and 4.</seg>
<seg id="79">The certified copies No 3 and No 4 shall be sent at the latest on the first working day after the transport is completed to the local competent customs office in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="80">The customs office shall retain copy No 4 and return copy No 3, on which it shall verify the accuracy and validity, to the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="81">The consignee shall send the certified copy No 3 to the consignor in SR at the latest on the following working day after receipt.</seg>
<seg id="82">Transport in SR shall be deemed to have ended on the day the products are taken over by the recipient.</seg>
<seg id="83">Termination of the transport shall be proved by the consignor by production of copy No 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and the tax authority in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="84">Graph 3 — Circulation of the accompanying document in transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in SR and finished in CR</seg>
<seg id="85">In 2006, amendments to all excise laws were progressively adopted in SR, under which the consignor of goods under a duty suspension arrangement is required to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of the locally competent consignor before commencing transport.</seg>
<seg id="86">The document proving the cessation of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products shall be Copy No 3 of the accompanying document, certified by the consignee and his competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="87">The document proving the end of the transport of mineral oils, wine and beer is Copy No 3, certified by the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="88">The confirmation by the tax authorities of another Member State of the receipt of the said goods by the consignee shall be required where the latter is required under the legislation of the Member State concerned to certify copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="89">2.3 Registration of shipments initiated and terminated by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="90">There is no single electronic system in place to monitor the transport of goods under a duty suspension arrangement between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="91">Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the implementation of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of excisable products requires Member States and the European Commission to implement, from 1 July 2009, an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) enabling excise administrators in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the conditional exemption regime and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products within all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">This system will include national transport databases of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all traffic initiated and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the Register of Selected Products (EVV) module.</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of shipments carried out only in the territory of the Czech Republic, tax authorities can obtain information about the start or end of transport immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the securing of the tax on the goods conveyed by the consignor when the end of the transport is registered by the customs office to the locally competent consignee.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in SR use a database based on the SysNed application software which provides automation of their excise management activities and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised beneficiary in the SysNed application software, that data is automatically transferred to the System for Exchange of Excise Data (SEED) database.</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO-Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, which discussed the concrete process of cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">The two sides have become acquainted with the excise legislation and the excise management organisation in both states.</seg>
<seg id="103">Particular attention was paid to the procedure of the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic in authorising and/or beginning and ending the movement of excise products under the duty suspension arrangement and the exchange of information between the excise administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides: - will process total data on the quantities of excise products shipped from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started during the audited period, - will compare data on the transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and ethyl alcohol - Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the conditional exemption scheme started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the inspections, the periods examined were extended to the months of October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under a duty suspension arrangement was also subject to an inspection during those months.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total amount of excise goods that were transported under the duty suspension arrangement between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of transport records of goods under conditional exemption</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO-CR provided the Slovak side with a database of transport operations completed in the Czech Republic, which included a total of 5 876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5 738 related to mineral oils, 134 to ethyl alcohol and 4 to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO of the Slovak Republic forwarded to the Czech side a database of transport operations completed in the Slovak Republic, which included a total of 3 319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 related to mineral oil, 2 066 to ethyl alcohol and 557 to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO-CR compared the data on the shipments listed in the register of initiated shipments in the Czech Republic with the data on terminated shipments registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">The transport data for the months of November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which the SAO handed over to him at the beginning of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data allowing reliable reconciliation of individual traffic and therefore only 63% of traffic started were attributable.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transports were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. sender, receiver, transport date, amount of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on shipments started in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-Czech Republic with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the shipments started were unambiguously attributed.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the quantity of mineral oils was given in litres or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The quantity of alcohol was, in most cases, stated in litres, but this could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the database of that percentage of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">Quantities of tobacco products were given in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms by type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">Shipments initiated in the Czech Republic whose termination could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database, or whose data on the quantity of products transported did not match, were checked with the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="120">Accompanying documents for 487 shipments of ethyl alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were inspected.</seg>
<seg id="121">A check of these documents was carried out at the customs offices where the SAO-CR carried out the check.</seg>
<seg id="122">For shipments authorised by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested through DG C.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the realisation of 141 transport operations for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide the certified copies No 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products indicated on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products indicated in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, the Slovak side was transmitted traffic data registered in the Slovak database, which the transport database of the Czech customs administration did not contain.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR searched the database of the Slovak Customs Service for 95 traffic.</seg>
<seg id="126">Verification of the remaining 46 transport operations was requested by the competent customs offices locally, which proved their completion with copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of the transport carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of the initiated transport.</seg>
<seg id="128">The following cases were checked:</seg>
<seg id="129">- the Slovak database of transport registered 11 shipments of ethyl alcohol in a total quantity of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 shipments of ethyl alcohol in a total quantity of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-CR found that this was a transport of taxed products that the sender does not need the approval of the tax administration to start.</seg>
<seg id="131">The dispatcher informed the tax authorities in writing of the start of the service. The transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement;</seg>
<seg id="132">- A total of 94 mineral oil shipments, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, were registered in the Slovak transport database, in a total volume of 173,000 litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out the transport of 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without the proper authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="134">The taxpayer held a special licence to receive and use exempt products, under which tax-free products could be supplied only to the holder of the same licence.</seg>
<seg id="135">He did not notify the initiation of the transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic and did not provide security of tax of CZK 1,207,680 on the products shipped.</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the taxpayer shipped 71 000 litres of taxed mineral oils into SR. Even in those cases, he failed to comply with a legal obligation by failing to notify the customs office of the commencement of the transport operations.</seg>
<seg id="137">Shipping of products put into free circulation on the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the shipper in the Czech Republic without the approval of the customs office, but he is required to notify the customs office in writing before the transport begins.</seg>
<seg id="138">A taxpayer who purchases products put into free circulation in another Member State is required to declare the quantity and secure the tax before they are collected.</seg>
<seg id="139">Products may only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also permits the use of an accompanying document for transport under a duty suspension arrangement, but on which it must be clearly indicated that it is a ‘simplified accompanying document for the purposes of fiscal control (products subject to excise duty)’.</seg>
<seg id="141">The same rules governing the transport and admission of products placed in free circulation in another Member State apply in SR.</seg>
<seg id="142">In those cases, the tax authorities transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under a conditional exemption scheme, the 3rd and 4th copies of which the beneficiary submitted to the SR tax authorities for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">Customs authorities in SR registered these services in the transport database under a conditional exemption scheme, as the accompanying documents did not indicate that they were a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the transport database of the Czech Customs Administration with the transport database of the Slovak Customs Administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases, the quantity of products transported was reported inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, hectolitres or kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of ethyl alcohol transported shown in the invoices did not tally with the quantity registered in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices were listed in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- two shipments of ethyl alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic made in November 2004 were registered in the Slovak customs database in a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol which were not in the Czech customs database.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between Czech Customs and Slovak Customs</seg>
<seg id="151">Until 30 June 2005, Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums governed the conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office to ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise administration and be responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, an ‘Excise Liaison Office’ (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ELO of the Czech Republic’) was set up in DG C to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">The security of tasks related to the management of systems to control the movement of goods subject to excise duties (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the SR was carried out with effect from 1 May 2004 by the ELO office of the customs office Poprad.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of the ELO office are carried out by the ELO (located in Poprada) of the Excise Duties Department of the Customs Directorate of SR (hereinafter referred to as ELO SR).</seg>
<seg id="157">Under Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of movements of goods subject to excise duties sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System (MVS).</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and ISA systems are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - system for exchanging information on tax entities trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system is made up of national registers of excise payers and allows tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to ascertain whether products subject to excise duty are being traded by a person authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States only for excise purposes.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union are able to obtain confirmation of the information held in that database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z. z., with Section 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z. z., with Section 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. z and with Section 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. z ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, beneficiaries and tax warehouses - the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or beneficiary in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO of the Slovak Republic found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place generally once a month during the audited period, exceptionally several times a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">SR Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">Data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from a national register in which all persons authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorisations to dispose of such products are registered.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Customs requests for information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - An early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">Transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission regulation is considered to be a risky consignment and transport is assessed as a risky consignment by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is carried out in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - to be sent when the limits laid down are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- a warning message - is sent when the transport of goods is assessed as being at risk.</seg>
<seg id="176">When assessing the risk level of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database for sending a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the event that the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the residence of the consignee does not match), ELO SR shall draw up a warning message to be sent to the ELO of the Member State of the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">ELO's reporting is governed by the Tax and Customs Commission Regulations CED 317 and CED 457, which, among other things, determine the type and quantity of goods in the respective units of measurement for information and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">During the audited period, ELO SR sent one warning message.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on shipments of products initiated in excess of the limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving the transport.</seg>
<seg id="181">If, on the basis of its own analysis, the tax authorities in the Czech Republic assess the consignment as a risk, they will process a so-called warning message, which they will send to the relevant Member State via the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005, ELO ČR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The ISA - the system for controlling the movement of goods - allows, through applications, the ISA to control the individual transport of excisable products as well as the control of the specified transport route between the entities mentioned in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information is based on a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system is mainly used in cases where the consignor takes a certified copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requests e.g. reimbursement of excise duty, and in cases where the data contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">During the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 applications to ISAs.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO ČR sent 25 applications to ELO SR to MVS.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often checked the information contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantity of products received and/or dispatched, or whether the consignor of products mentioned in the accompanying document was authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty, if this could not be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="189">Received ISA applications in both countries were forwarded to customs offices locally responsible for the consignee or consignor of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="190">The customs authorities checked the required data and notified the outcome of the investigation to the other member country via ELO.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the SAO-Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the field of excise duties in the two states, the procedure of the Customs Authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the opening and closing of the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between the two states, the registration of these traffic, and to further compare the exchange of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">(a) the procedure followed by the tax authorities and the tax authorities in commencing the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of products under the conditional exemption regime can only be initiated by a tax entity in the Czech Republic with the approval of the tax administration, which authorises the commencement of the transport on condition that the transported products have been provided with a tax guarantee equal to the tax attributable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The commencement of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme in SR is not subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, the taxpayer was required to notify the tax authorities of the start of the transport of ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">He could start the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all excise laws were progressively adopted in SR, under which the consignor of goods under a duty suspension arrangement is required to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of local authority of the consignor before commencing transport;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for dispatching copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copies No 3 and No 4 of the accompanying document to the tax authority for verification at the latest on the following working day after the transport is completed.</seg>
<seg id="202">The certified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor at the latest on the following working day following receipt from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="203">The recipient in SR is required to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3 certified by the tax authorities and the consignee of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in both SR and the Czech Republic keep an electronic register of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping such records are not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="206">Customs authorities in both countries record all the data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under a duty suspension arrangement between the Member States of the European Union, allowing excise duty managers in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Under Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system to monitor the movement of excisable products is foreseen from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of the agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme started in SR and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database included 5,876 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side handed over to the Czech side a database of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in SR.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database included 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared the data for shipments listed in the register of shipments initiated in the Czech Republic with the record of shipments terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">Data reconciliation was hampered by the fact that the quantities of goods being shipped were not uniformly reported in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute data on individual traffic in the two registers, an examination of the accompanying documents was carried out and neither breaches of the conditional exemption scheme nor cases of tax evasion were found.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the basis of the findings of the parallel controls, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the traffic register to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The setting up of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow for the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under suspension of excise duty within the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on follow-up results</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction Word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes in general are a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Value added tax (VAT) fraud is an example.</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated each year in the European Union (EU).</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as 2005, attendees of the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, hereinafter also referred to as BRH) carried out the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between the SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the steps being taken to address the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a follow-up parallel check.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)</seg>
<seg id="18">Target of control:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The objective of the audit operation was to examine the VAT administration procedure of the tax authorities, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of the two countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was also intended to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were intended to compare with established good practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period was the years 2006 to 2008 and, where relevant, the period before and after, until the end of the auditing period.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">A follow-up inspection of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions have been identified during previous parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further screening.</seg>
<seg id="28">Based on the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations on VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up was carried out to evaluate the actions taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspected cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit further focused on e.g. selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of claims and the carrying out of VAT checks on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When reviewing the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors made the following control findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from previous check</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel controls, a comparison of VAT registration systems in the two countries identified differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different ways of registering cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation has been made at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT payers' tax identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="38">He also amended the common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on adequate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of that document, agreed by the EU Member States under ECOFIN, no longer contains the issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="44">In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly reporting period to allow for more timely examination of intra-Community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to file recapitulative statements on a monthly basis was not introduced by the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany with a view to making VIES data more reliable and considering linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the perpetrators of the fraudulent activity will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit found that our two Member States use different risk management systems, which have their strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO audited EUROCANET, which allows information exchange within the EU, while BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected intra-Community transaction cases</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous audit operation, business transactions were jointly examined where there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of business transactions on tax returns or recapitulative statements by tax payers from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">The two SAIs selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the respective countries have not been completed by the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">A follow-up action verified that most of the tax proceedings in relation to the specified selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany had been concluded and that adequate measures had been taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT assessments or avoidance of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-Community transactions by EU payers enrolled in EUROCANET were selected for the check.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The participation of Member States in this scheme is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the scheme if some Member States refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Due to the fact that the German tax administration was not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained on which suppliers with German VAT IDs were assessed as being at risk.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the framework of the audit operation, the SAO found both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT activities.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax authorities have limited means of controlling risky transactions, particularly when it comes to missing traders, and mere physical examination of documents can make it difficult to prove any fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation for tax administrations arises when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater co-operation between customs and financial authorities to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other instruments are being used to detect at-risk taxpayers, which have so far proved successful for the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, there is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council has reached a political consensus on the proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in using EUROCANET should underpin the creation of this new network to fight VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance for recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the way in which applications for international recovery assistance are handled is identical in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs find it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, SAIs agree that reliable statistics should include more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to produce an analysis, based on more detailed statistics, to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In both SAIs' view, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates to be able to raise recovery rates to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in the process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAIs analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control of large tax entities (VDS) in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they gathered information from tax administrations in the form of a questionnaire on areas that SAIs consider essential for the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The responses received clearly show that the situation in the two countries is developing differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases, relying on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures the effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">The establishment of a dedicated financial office for the management of VDS is planned in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist, making it difficult to manage and analyse VAT controls in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far concentrated more on selecting the individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of data from the VAT return and recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of this data relies on various risk management components which will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Control Action Progress</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Czech Republic Follow-up</seg>
<seg id="101">The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Division II - the revenue department of the state budget and territorial departments IX. Plzeň, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the Czech Ministry of Finance) and 25 financial offices (hereinafter also referred to as the ‘FIU’): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ Brno in Břeclav, FÚ BrÚ Vary, FÚ VÚ in Domestic, FÚ BrÚFÚ FÚFÚFÚ in PraÚFÚFÚ KrÚFÚFÚ, FÚ ÚFÚFÚFÚ I and FÚFÚFÚFÚFÚ FÚ I8, FÚ</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion from this audit action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Conduct of the inspection operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Indirect Taxation Control Unit and the personnel of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the inspection operation.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, a control event took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-sever), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions took place with the fiscal authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and the finance directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">A report on the inspection findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In preparation for the parallel audit events, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions was held in September 2008 to discuss and identify topics of control.</seg>
<seg id="113">Subsequently, in December 2008, the leaders of the two SAIs signed an agreement to cooperate in carrying out parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the control teams informed each other of the initial results achieved in the course of preparing the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on a course of action.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on 2-4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The review teams exchanged the findings collected so far and agreed on a timetable for compiling a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two SAIs, in carrying out parallel control actions, decided to focus on: • a follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • an examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel check; • an examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high risk; • a review of the tax administration's procedure in the area of international assistance for the recovery of VAT receivables; • tax controls of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of previous review recommendations</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous audit action, the SAO recommended the modification of the conditions of VAT registration and the introduction of a new rule for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not use the power to cancel VAT registration to taxpayers who did not comply with the obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll. on Value Added Tax (‘the VAT Act’).</seg>
<seg id="127">The amendment of the provision to introduce the obligation for tax administrations to cancel the VAT registration of payers upon repeated non-submission of a VAT return has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the VAT Act, the tax authority may revoke the registration of the taxpayer ‘ex officio’ in cases where: (a) the taxpayer has not, without giving notice of the reason to the tax authority, carried out a transaction for 12 consecutive months; (b) the taxpayer has failed to fulfil his obligations under this Act; (c) the taxpayer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In a previous audit action, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the Tax Office for Threshold 1 to cancel VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers who had not incurred any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">Often, the FVO for Threshold 1 did not revoke these taxpayers' VAT registration, as the relevant provision provided an insufficient deadline for deregistration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was eliminated by amending the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax authorities shall be entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established taxpayer where the taxpayer has not supplied any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with a right to deduct VAT in the preceding calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="135">In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a one-month deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to file recapitulative statements in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">A summary report must also be made by the payer if the services for which the place of supply is determined in accordance with Paragraph 9(1) of the VAT Code are supplied to a person registered for tax in another Member State and the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the tax on those services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of the service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative reports to achieve higher data reliability in VIES This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration conducts comparisons of intra-Community transaction data reported in VAT returns and summary reports of Czech payers automated in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Combating VAT fraud is therefore an area of priority concern and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is evidenced, inter alia, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and the actual VAT collected in the 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as the EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concludes that the estimated amount of loss of uncollected VAT for this period is between €90 and €113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action found that an effective risk management system could not be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in every EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">Regarding the risk management system, the SAO carried out a check of EUROCANET, a system used to exchange information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-Community transactions by EU tax payers included in EUROCANET were selected for the check (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should help to improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities into a form that allows fraud to be detected in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later also become an important source of information in risk assessment for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812, while setting out the basic principles that will guide the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The EUROFISC picture is the already functioning EUROCANET fast and selective information exchange system, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report produced the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers, based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance brought the scheme to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improvements to the system are made on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">Currently, the questionnaire data is electronically processed and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to safeguard the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="172">A law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="173">That law includes provisions for the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to achieve greater data reliability in VIES and consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative reporting systems</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group was set up, made up of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group has developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the working group looked at a tool designed to optimise the control process for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a participant in this exchange under the so-called Risk Management Platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of the platform and, following a written consultation on 18 October 2006, the establishment of the Risk Management Platform was added to the Fiscalis Action Plan 2006-2007.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform are further divided into sub-groups that address individual topics such as: • risk management tools; • influencing behaviour; • evaluation; • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports on the performance of these subgroups were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the withdrawal of such registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT payer tax identification number database.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">For the time being, the issue of registration and de-registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on that draft Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and only have the obligation to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation about these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs deplore the Commission's failure to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs view this measure as an important preventive element in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome further efforts from the Commission in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="201">In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly reporting period, allowing for a more timely examination of intra-Community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced a monthly recapitulative reporting obligation according to a fixed calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in line with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater data reliability in VIES and consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is ongoing so far and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO carried out a check of EUROCANET, a system used to exchange information in the EU (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">BRH in this area concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-Community transaction cases</seg>
<seg id="213">The previous audit operation jointly examined the execution of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or inconsistencies in the way in which the payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions on their VAT returns or recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, whose control by the tax administrations of the two countries had not been completed during a previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="215">1.</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech payer purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German payer in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return because the German taxpayer did not have a VAT ID allocated to him during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax authorities received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for the intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that, on the basis of a check carried out by the Czech tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared the acquisition of the goods at that value and at the same time claimed the same amount of VAT deductible on that tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2.</seg>
<seg id="221">In the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase EUR 12 561 worth of goods from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of those goods was denied by the Czech taxpayer and did not appear on his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax administration refused to cooperate at the request of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax authorities did not obtain evidence, they terminated the inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had received two spontaneous pieces of information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and listed this acquisition on the correct VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">In the 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech payer was to purchase a €48,500 passenger car from a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods in question was not declared by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax authorities charged CZK 0 in VAT for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax authorities invited the payer to submit an additional VAT return, but this was not submitted by the payer.</seg>
<seg id="232">A subsequent check revealed that the tax administrator had carried out other acts in the tax procedure in 2007 which showed that the passenger car in question had been sold by the Czech taxpayer to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax authorities issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax year, by which they retrospectively assessed VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was cancelled with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of enforcement of the taxpayer's enforceable assets, the arrears appear to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was to make deliveries of new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005 for a total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">A response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 revealed that there was an open tax-criminal case against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">In a follow-up, BRH obtained information that, after the tax proceedings in Germany had been completed, it was demonstrably established that the German taxpayer had been integrated into fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intracomanial acquisitions of goods were taxed at a value of €182,424 (2004) and €369,690 (2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO subsequently found that the Czech payer had been involved in carousel business with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the examination of the supply of goods, a VAT check was initiated with the Czech tax entity for the tax years April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the inspection findings and information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information, the tax authorities additionally assessed VAT for the period May 2005 at CZK 703 031 and for the period June 2005 at CZK 726 551.</seg>
<seg id="244">5.</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth a total of EUR 58 000 from a German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was due to deliver EUR 88 027 worth of machinery to Czech payer B in Q3 2004, but payer B denied this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that payer B had acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit set up in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer A did not report the acquisition of goods from a German payer on his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">A reply from the German tax authorities to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer had not made an intra-Community supply of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but had made a delivery of the goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">BRH subsequently found that, following a tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine had been reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption had been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German taxpayer was due to deliver EUR 11,600 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO's subsequent audit found that the Czech tax administration had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods at that value, was wrongly recorded.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that after receiving a response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and retrospectively assessed VAT worth EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Further movement of goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The German payer's summary report has not yet been corrected as only the payer who filed the recapitulative statement can make corrections to the recapitulative statements in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as to whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">The Czech tax authorities assessed the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 after the tax procedure for the February 2005 tax year and told the German tax authorities that they could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been revoked in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administration sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">A subsequent check by BRH found that the German taxpayer had changed his residence and that the new locally competent tax authority had revoked the VAT exemption for the supply of the car in question to the Czech taxpayer on the basis of the inspection carried out.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the figures in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the tax authority's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to VIES data, the German taxpayer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech taxpayer between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator was trying to determine the causes of the differences incurred by the Czech taxpayer in acquiring goods between Q3 2004 and Q1 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech Tax Administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of purchased goods amounting to CZK 134 273 for the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005, since, according to the Czech Tax Administrator, it was not possible to accurately capture the business transactions for each quarter and therefore the Tax Administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German taxpayer delivered EUR 46 854 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">The Czech payer admitted intra-Community acquisitions of goods worth only EUR 14 856 over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax authority verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total declared value of the supply of goods of EUR 31 998, a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="274">A subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary VAT return for the July 2004 tax year only in January 2007, after many urges from the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="275">At the same time, in that tax return, the taxpayer exercised the right to deduct VAT, thus keeping the tax liability for that tax period unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">A follow-up check verified that for selected cases of business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most tax procedures were completed and that the tax authorities in both the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. subsequently assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Checking selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Czech Republic audit results</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for detecting risky entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting from the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="282">In the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system have been selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States was captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">As the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained to help establish whether suppliers with German VAT IDs were assessed by the German tax administration as risk subjects.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where applicable, tax administrations have made use of the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• The tax authorities did not detect any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities keep track of such tax entities due to their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show any deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the accounting records submitted, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relationships with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">Locally competent tax authorities have mostly screened the risky tax entities and risk transactions identified in the signals from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax authorities have limited options when examining risky transactions, particularly in the context of the screening of missing traders , and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer from a physical check of documents alone.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible deregistration would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered to report fictitious intra-EU supplies of goods or to issue formally correct tax documents to payers who unduly draw deductions of input VAT on their basis.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where there is a suspicion of involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other fraud, and where goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in shipping documentation, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament in late 2008 as a weakness of EUROFISC, which should be remedied by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Control results in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed the information available from the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">Those figures were the criterion for selecting six files of German taxpayers for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Like some other countries, Germany has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:.in the Government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public administrative) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis for breaching the applicable rules on the concealment of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States within EUROCANET. ‘17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of EUROCANET data and forwarding them to the tax authorities of the Länder in accordance with an agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been enrolled in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities receive no information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationship with traders from other Member States who also have business relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both countries' tax administrations have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is essential to establish a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The EU Council has reached a political consensus on a proposal for a regulation whose main contribution lies in the establishment of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="318">Experience gained from using EUROCANET data should also become part of the envisaged network to fight VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases brought before courts at national and European level show that a discussion between Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International recovery assistance in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following directives provide the basic framework for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order while amending the aforementioned Act No 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No 191/2004 Coll. on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">The new regulation in the system for adjusting international cooperation for the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annex to the regulation sets out new templates for applications to be used from 1.1.2009, the new obligation for electronic communication and the obligation for the requesting authority to certify the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Guiding principles for providing international recovery cooperation:</seg>

<seg id="334">2. assistance is always given only on request containing the prescribed elements;</seg>

<seg id="336">4. the provision of international recovery assistance shall be governed by the domestic law of the requesting State;</seg>

<seg id="339">7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has used, without success, all the available options to recover a claim under its legal system).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms of assistance, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The locally competent tax office shall electronically send a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the finance directorates.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance will provide a translation of the request into the relevant language, scan it, including its attachments, and send it to the competent authority of the tax administration of the designated State via the CCN/CSI network.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two basic requirements for enforcement: the claim must be for more than €1,500 and must not be more than 5 years old.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">Upon receipt of a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the request as soon as possible and no later than seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal and indicate the specific provisions of the Directive it invokes.</seg>
<seg id="349">Such communication shall be sent no later than three months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance verifies that the application has all the elements required by law and should transmit the application without delay through the Finance Directorate to the local tax office for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax authorities inter alia survey the debtor's assets, e.g. by obtaining land registry statements, checking bank accounts, verifying vehicle registration at the DMV, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">Six months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities, where recovery is not possible, the applicant authority should also be informed.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any sums recovered by the tax authorities shall be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not inconceivable that the Czech tax authorities collecting foreign claims will allow it to be waived or paid in instalments if the State requesting the recovery agrees to do so.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the recovery period, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments under Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty is due to the State that requested the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of accepted recovery requests, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the application to the locally competent tax authorities on time, in particular in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the framework of international recovery assistance as well as in the case of applications received from tax administrations from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not comply with Act No 191/2004 Coll. because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date when the receipt of the application was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistics</seg>
<seg id="363">The Czech Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(4) of Act No 191/2004 Coll., shall compile statistics for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery sent or received in the past year, indicating the amount of claims to which the requests relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">The European Commission draws up a report on the state of recovery on the basis of supporting documents provided by all EU Member States, which it submits to the EU Council and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the recovered receivables item in 2008 by EUR 5,250,000 by stating the incorrect value of the recovered VAT receivable (this was a shift in the decimal point after converting the receivable from Czech crowns to a value in euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">This error was subsequently reflected in European Commission statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance, including recoveries, is given in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International recovery assistance in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In the interests of more accessible wording and better clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply inter alia to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the EC Act of 3 May 2003 on the collection of state taxes.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German fiscal code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities can provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities in force in national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of Germany's fiscal code (Articles 249-346) enshrines legal provisions governing the enforcement process.</seg>
<seg id="376">In particular, the administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed by the instructions for execution and the instructions for enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the Länder supreme tax authorities regarding the principles of administrative assistance in the assessment of taxes and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general conditions for lodging requests for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• Claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be definitive.</seg>
<seg id="382">• No more than 5 years may elapse between the issue of an enforcement order or the date on which the claim comes into effect (i.e. is no longer subject to an appeal) and the date on which the applications are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount receivable must be more than EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for the recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the tax authorities' implementing departments to the relevant foreign office, such as the Czech CLO, via the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">Further follow the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 A working group of the Federal Government and the Land Governments is currently reviewing this methodological guideline in order to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">Applications, including attachments, shall be submitted electronically by the Financial Conduct Authority to the Intermediate Authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">This office checks the accuracy of the application in content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the request is not correct, it shall be returned to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it meets all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and will also provide a translation of the request.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt shall be sent within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check whether the formal requirements have been met.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediary office, which then forwards them to the competent tax authorities and monitors their processing.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the request takes more than 6 months to process, the intermediate authority shall invite the submission of an interim report to be submitted in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">Once the formal and factual elements of the request have been checked, the implementing departments shall notify the enforcement method.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any sums recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of their receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistics</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual assistance for recovery between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) can be found in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Recovery control, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">Under international cooperation, 21 requests for international recovery assistance between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="404">Examination of 10 selected cases found, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20.10.2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany received a request for recovery of a VAT claim for the years 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, or CZK 109 820, from a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax authority until 26.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administration established a mortgage on properties owned by a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since it was not possible to pay the entire recovered debt by mortgaging the properties, a payment schedule was agreed with the Czech tax entity, with repayments of at least CZK 2 000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31.8.2009, information was sent to the German tax administration on the state of recovery, noting that as of 25.8.2009 this claim had been partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49 600.</seg>
<seg id="411">This sum was sent to Germany and then another instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany on 28.8.2009.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7.1.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax arrears from a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 180 869, or CZK 4 434 915, in Germany for VAT and for income tax and related taxes.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax authority only on 27.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">The tax administrator, by examining the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Furthermore, the local investigation established that the debtor did not stay at the address of permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6.4.2009 and on 16.4.2009 the reply from the tax administration was sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany on 21.11.2007 for recovery concerning tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3 139, or CZK 84 846.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for the recovery of this claim to the tax authorities on 6.8.2008, although on 18.2.2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance had received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax authorities that the recovery request was being processed by the payment of a claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also recovered in the context of recovery in the Czech Republic and entered in Germany on 27.10.2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time limits within which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the competent tax authorities, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and by the Czech tax authorities recovering the claim.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against a claim from a further recovery request of EUR 6 649 to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance records only a claim for recovery of EUR 3 139 with this company, a claim for recovery of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the Czech Ministry of Finance file with the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany to recover the tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 39 957 in income tax and VAT and accessories in Germany, or CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="430">A recovery procedure was initiated on 1.6.2009, ordering the seizure of a claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and of a salary deduction (the deduction amounted to CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">In his dealings with the tax authority, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax administrator found that the taxpayer was willing to repay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="433">The tax entity has promised to discuss the application with the German tax administration with a view to obtaining a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery of the debt was still ongoing during the audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19.11.2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request from Germany concerning a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 3 116 304 in income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="437">It was not until 14.11.2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the Tax Office for Prague 1, which is responsible for administering the tax to non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, as it was not possible to determine the locally competent tax authority on the basis of the address given by the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="438">During the FÚ investigation, it was informed that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19.9.2008; however, the FÚ could no longer issue an enforcement order for that amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance did not transmit the request for recovery until after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26.1.2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated enforcement of the claim and issued an execution order for the attachment of the claim to the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery of the debt was still ongoing during the audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax authority requested international cooperation in recovering the VAT claim and costs totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3.10.2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the German tax authorities transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Federal Bank, the sum received from the execution of funds in the debtor's account, amounting to EUR 17 700, or CZK 439 226.</seg>
<seg id="445">An error in the recalculation of the amount recovered was found when verifying the volume of claims recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recovered amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 erroneously to EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct conversion of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781,83.</seg>
<seg id="448">A request was therefore sent to Germany to recover the sum, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover a tax arrears with a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 1 970 632 in VAT and accessories, or EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send an application to the German tax administration until 10.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4.2.2009, the German tax authorities called on the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant decreases in the company's turnover in the 2nd half of 2008 and in particular in the 1st half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: EUR 4 600 on 8.4.2009, EUR 3 000 on 6.5.2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16.6.2009.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to a tax administration account in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23.6.2009, the German tax authorities agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30.6.2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">A claim for recovery totalling EUR 398 653, or CZK 9 832 779, including a claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech tax authorities to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2.10.2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3.4.2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified the refund on the ground that the tax on the transfer of immovable property was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax administration further stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims in relation to income tax and wealth tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and on capital listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with Article 1(4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to draw up and submit a new request for recovery, excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax of CZK 61 759 and including arrears of VAT, corporation tax and personal income tax, which will be re-sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax administration for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same taxpayer who owes CZK 7 079 735 in income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6.2.2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears by a Czech taxpayer who owed CZK 3 445 782, or EUR 123 328, in personal income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of that amount, VAT was CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the German tax administration until 18.04.2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax administration the reply from the German tax administration dated 9.7.2007 until 11.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax authorities had issued an enforcement order against the bank account with the bank on 11.6.2007, but it said that it had no business relations with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">By doing so, the German tax authorities considered the application to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26.9.2005, the Czech tax authorities sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, or EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The application from the Czech tax administration was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10.10.2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the German tax administration on 15.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed the execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and the payroll deduction and set up a lien on the immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16.3.2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">The reply to a request for information received by the Czech tax authorities on 16.9.2005 showed that the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activity.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20.4.2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax authorities only on 12.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The reply stated that no recovery proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the debtor's insolvency - no assets had been identified for him and his income from non-business activities was already subject to another enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="481">In doing so, the German tax administration considered the request for recovery to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States follow the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the way in which applications for international recovery assistance are handled is identical in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay close attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In a 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of discrepancies in the statistics had decreased, even though the number of applications had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important that statistical issues are renegotiated at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics are to show the annual number of claims as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of claims recovered by each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States as this may assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that recovery rates per Member State can be calculated is considered useful by both SAIs for Member States with lower recovery rates to intensify their efforts and seek to improve recovery rates at least to the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in the process.</seg>
<seg id="495">Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery on time to the locally competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax administrations from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance had failed to comply with Act No 191/2004 Coll. on International Assistance for Recovery of Claims because it had not informed the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date on which the application was confirmed to have been received.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for the control of VDS is based on Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were set up or set up for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period indicated in the income tax return for natural/legal persons amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="504">The classification of the taxpayer as a VDS took place after the submission of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time for 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A taxable person ceased to be known as VDS when, in three consecutive tax years from the end of the tax return under which he was included in the VDS, his net turnover for the tax year fell below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">A taxpayer could not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax check of at least one tax per tax year.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were checked at a minimum frequency of five years by the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">From 2010 onwards, a written assessment of the taxpayer must be carried out at least every two years and the follow-up chosen must eliminate tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The FCA control is focused on at least one type of tax; tax authorities generally elect several tax years at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="510">VDS were audited by the specialist inspection departments, which are set up in total for 13 FCs, or by the control departments of locally competent FCs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The Specialised Inspections Unit carries out tax inspections within the remit set by the Director of the Finance Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• Tax entities operating in unusual and specific business sectors;</seg>
<seg id="514">• Entities for which it is technically and time-consuming to carry out a tax audit;</seg>
<seg id="515">• Entities with a sprawling territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• Entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• Entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified luring of excess deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax inspections carried out by the specialised inspection units of the FCA and the results of those inspections are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed an amendment to Act No 531/1990 Coll. on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists of the establishment of a specialised FÚ with nationwide coverage for selected tax entities (inter alia for corporate entities created for business purposes, which have achieved a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT controls on large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • German Fiscal Code (AO), • Fiscal Governance Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax inspection on the spot. In particular, these articles lay down the rules governing the admissibility of on-the-spot tax checks (i.e. at the premises of the business), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules governing the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of control, the duty of the taxpayer to cooperate and the conditions for carrying out the final discussion and the communication of the inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Governance Act Pursuant to Section 5.1, point 1, in conjunction with Section 19 of the Act, participation in on-the-spot tax inspections carried out by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The authorities involved will agree with each other on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's involvement in tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the particular undertakings it selects be subject to an inspection at a time to be determined by it.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case, it may declare rules on the conduct and content of the inspection at the premises of such companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Rules on tax controls According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German acronym BpO 2000) were agreed by the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament in which the governments of the Länder are represented.</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative provisions apply to on-the-spot checks by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Undertakings are classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Under Article 33.1 of the BpO 2000, any informed tax authority must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration provides the following guidance:</seg>
<seg id="538">• A uniform manual for special VAT controls in Germany ;</seg>
<seg id="539">• a USLO manual setting out the methodology for using intra-Community trade relations data conducted in VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">• the ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are assessed every three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to inspect - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">As a general rule, inspections of large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually announced including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that, in the course of the inspection, checks will be carried out definitively, in particular on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisation of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by the checks is usually between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 foresees a three-year control period.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes on a given company are subject to verification.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Control management of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs chose not to examine individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues to get an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT controls at VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">By means of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax authorities on areas they consider essential to the management of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses, related to the VAT inspection of VDS, are available to the management of tax administrations?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or measurement records that distinguish between the fight against VAT fraud and, in general, VAT control?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow for such a distinction at the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between a check designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT check.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or a record of the timeliness of VAT checks (linked to the time period of transactions checked)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Records of timeliness of questioning relevant for intra-Community acquisition of goods on behalf of selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, the information registered in the ADIS system also includes data on how long the questioning took.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average time of the last check (year information).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the statistics produced at Federal level for the special VAT control units do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• There are some statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenues generated, disaggregated for example according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer has improperly applied a reduced rate of VAT instead of the standard rate of tax);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. moving a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of tax levied retrospectively broken down by type of tax, by the number of taxable entities audited and by the number of tax years audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax practices (local inquiry, complaint procedure) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Timetables and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">General debt statistics broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax identified by the tax authorities, are also kept.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not distinguish between the criteria listed.</seg>
<seg id="579">In addition, most of the tax administrations visited do not distinguish between these differences.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are the control areas from which high additional revenues are generated recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administration has the right to select the taxpayer for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="583">It follows that uniform stats at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">Nevertheless, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must record their increased tax (VAT) liability if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In that case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the tax increase imposed.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS claims an unjustified right to deduct input tax on supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity under Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which have been used for representation under Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- The VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Article 21(1) of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It has been established that there are no regulations at Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It follows that uniform stats at Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">VAT findings are not recorded separately by the Länder if they result from VDS tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must enter their assessed increased tax (VAT) liability if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Revenue Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of areas of control from which there is a high "yield" and draw conclusions for management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no federal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform Federal-level statisticians for Tax Controllers and Special VAT Inspection Units do not provide data on audit areas from which high "revenue" is generated.</seg>
<seg id="602">There are differing views on the analysis process as well as on case management in terms of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the responses of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a wealth of data from the tax checks carried out, as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same is true of the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, it is planned to set up a dedicated financial office for the management of VDS in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">It follows that those tasks are more difficult to perform in a similar manner.</seg>
<seg id="611">Germany's philosophy, however, places greater emphasis on selecting individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenue.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, it will increase the revenue from VAT collection and improve the level of risk detection among unreliable entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two SAIs on parallel controls of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">The two SAIs got to know each other better about the systems in place in the following areas: • intra-Community transactions; • VAT risk management, in particular regarding the selection of risk-prone transactions; • Assistance to recover VAT claims; and • VAT control of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Cooperation between them has revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud cases as well as differences in the above areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and good practices were identified based on them.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will give a boost to stakeholders to start a discussion on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation between the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="626">Release deadline: June 2010.</seg>
