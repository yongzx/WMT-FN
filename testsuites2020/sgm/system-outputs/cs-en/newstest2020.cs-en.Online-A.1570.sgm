<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The present material informs about the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvy higher control office of the Slovak Republic, which focused on the area of value added tax administration and the use of the Value Added Tax Information Exchange System (VIES).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the procedure of tax authorities in examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions carried out between member states of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the VIES system has enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of value added tax payers in each Member State of the European Union and on commercial transactions made by such payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the data in the VIES system and the data in the value added tax return filed by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit of the parallel checks carried out consisted not only in the exchange of information on the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular in the examination of the use of VIES in the control of the application of the right to value added tax exemption in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lessons learned from the implementation of parallel controls are beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel checks on value added tax administration for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2006 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Inspection number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of control: (GB) Value added tax administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and the fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>

<seg id="16">The control actions carried out in parallel were coordinated checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated control has been processed within the meaning of European Enforcement Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent set out in the contract and drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated control was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Cr") and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "Slovakia").</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties have contractually committed themselves to providing information from public sources, from the Value Added Tax Information Exchange System (VIES) and data on received and submitted requests for verification of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Czech Republic, the control was carried out by the Department of State Budget and the Territorial Departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the Ministry of Finance and 12 tax offices: the Tax Office in Mladá Boleslav, the Tax Office in Kolín, the Financial Office in Teplice, the Tax Office in Karlovy Vary, the Tax Office in Tábor, the Tax Office brno III, the Tax Office in Znojmo, the Tax Office in Zlín, the Tax Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office ostrava I, the Tax Office for Prague 7 and the Tax Office for Prague 9.</seg>

<seg id="25">Objective of checks:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "the EU") and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the vat exemption entitlement.</seg>
<seg id="27">The period of control in the coordinated period was from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States, which allows tax authorities to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and, in the country of destination, to check whether the purchaser has properly admitted and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inspection identified differences of national systems of VIES in the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The summary reports shall indicate the values of the delivery of goods to other EU Member States, the values of the services provided shall not be included in the recapitulative reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from summary reports submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States mentioned in vat tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities transmit the summary report data to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends it to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Slovakia, the data from the summary reports submitted by Slovak payers at the tax offices are only transferred to electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Society (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of the supply of goods and the value of the supply of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values specified in the summary reports with the values of the delivery of goods according to vat returns and to identify their possible differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Czech Technical Party, the values of the goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on the common line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, in the SR, the system does not automatically identify differences between the values of delivery of goods according to VAT returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="38">The separate reporting of the values of supplies of goods in VAT returns makes it possible to use the results of comparison of data when checking the exemption of supplies of goods to the EU from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="39">The data received from summary reports submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed at CLO and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods given by the payer from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in vat returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, this data is sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities decide for themselves which cases of differences will be examined.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of delivery and acquisition of goods must be examined by the tax authorities and will transmit to the local tax authorities a list of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that the most significant derogations will ensure that VAT was granted at the correct amount when the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="43">Furthermore, the check highlighted some problems in the VAT management system of complications caused by the different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. the supply and acquisition of goods carried out by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summaries are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum deadline for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Shortening the period for which summaries are submitted to one month, together with the reduction of the processing period, would allow earlier access to data in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="46">Thus, tax authorities could more effectively verify whether VAT has been granted at the correct level in intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and summaries for the same tax year (month) would allow for a faster verification of whether the payer has reported the same value of supplies of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">The differences between the values of delivery of goods reported by EU payers and the values of the acquisition of goods reported by the payers from the Czech Republic or The Czech Republic were due, inter alia, to the value of the goods reported by the payers from the Czech Republic. different reporting of intra-Community delivery and acquisition data in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="49">This included, for example, the placing of advances received in summary reports, or the reporting of intra-community deliveries in the vendor's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than intra-Community acquisitions in the purchaser's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">Unifying the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also focused on the examination of selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, for which there were doubts about their implementation or suspected vat evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR found, inter alia, the following:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities have reported in their VAT returns for the purpose of unlawfully obtaining an excessive VAT deduction, the execution of intra-Community transactions that have not actually taken place;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax entities have reported intra-community supplies in carousel transactions in which there has been a deliberate multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers reported in their VAT tax returns and summaries intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called VAT-exempt. 'lost companies' and have not admitted the tax on the goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">suppliers have made intra-Community supplies of VAT-exempt goods to tax entities that have not been registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In such cases, the supply should not have been exempted from VAT and should have been subject to vat in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers reported intra-Community supplies of higher value in their VAT returns than those reported by intra-Community acquisitions, in some cases the VAT was awarded at an incorrect amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">The findings of the control action showed that VIES provides tax authorities with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax authorities should pay particular attention to the thorough examination of the differences between data reported by VAT payers and data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>

<seg id="224">In the preparation of parallel control actions, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic with representatives of the SAO SR took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants of this meeting became familiar with the legislation on VAT in both countries and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The negotiations resulted in the specification of the scope of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that cooperation would focus on the following areas: a) verification of the validity and correctness of vat registration plates of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic or SR in intra-Community supplies; b) examination of data on intra-community acquisitions specified in DAP by the payer in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of payers from the SR system contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and in The Slovak Republic on commercial transactions carried out.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out on the following volume of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the SR via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure for processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic in intra-Community delivery and acquisition of goods illustrates the following scheme.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intra-Community delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer carries out intra-Community supplies, he is obliged to pay until 25 April 2010 to pay for the intra-Community delivery. the day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic provides in SH summary information on the deliveries made by him to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in SR is obliged to enter into the SH the value of goods that have been exempted and delivered from the country to other EU Member States for the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the delivered goods are always given in Czech or Slovak currency broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Service data are not included in sh.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has entered erroneous data in sh, he is obliged to submit a follow-up SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the payer in SR finds that the data specified in the SH were incomplete or incorrect, he submits an corrective sh before the expiry of the deadline for filing sh, after the expiry of that period he is obliged to file an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system allows the exchange of information on registration data of VAT payers in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from the Czech Republic or The Czech Republic can verify whether the VAT number of the relevant purchaser is registered in the given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">The data from the submitted SH are grouped by the individual VAT registration number of the purchasers at MF CLO or DR CLO by VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="242">A summary value of all deliveries for each VAT number of the acquirer is created and the code of the method of filling from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers, the so-called "vat number". L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic (from the L1QD files) is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If vies in another Member State detects the wrong VAT number of the acquirer in the L1QD files sent, it generates a so-called 'vat number'. O_MCTL message that contains all the wrong VAT registration number, indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is subsequently sent to MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL report can contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous VAT registration, VAT registration is not registered in a given state or has never been allocated, the acquirer with a certain VAT number was not a VAT payer in a given quarter, the vat registration of the acquirer was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received reports O_MCTL to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the erroneous EU payer's VAT number is used in one of the sh or subsequent SH lines sent, the a so-called ADIS is generated by the relevant tax authority. "Notice of doubt on VAT ID".</seg>
<seg id="250">The Tax Office will examine whether the delivery to the VAT-registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In SR, DR CLO in VIES processes all messages O_MCTL and electronically sends them to locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of tax payers who have mentioned the wrong VAT number in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities subsequently invite the payer to submit an additional SH and the indication of the valid VAT number or the tax office will examine the delivery of the goods with the relevant payer when reporting the invalid VAT number in the filed SH.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of erroneous VAT registration numbers related to intra-Community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Out of a total of 41,728 VAT registration numbers of Czech payers listed in the Slovak payers' SH in the period from 2 January 2004 to 31 December 2004, the number of Czech payers in the Czech Period of Validity and The Czech Vat. quarter 2004 to 1 January 2004 929 erroneous VAT registrations, i.e. 929 VAT registrations, were 929 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 2,23 %.</seg>
<seg id="255">Out of a total of 62,997 VAT registration numbers for Slovak payers listed in the Czech payers' SH in the same period, 416 were erroneous VAT registration numbers, i.e. 416 VAT registration numbers. 0,66 %.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-Community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous VAT registration rates in their SH than the payers from the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="257">When examining the activities of financial or tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide, in all cases, up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="258">E.g.:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although, at the request of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in the 4th ed. a report was subsequently generated O_MCTL due to the termination of the payer's registration in that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation established that the marketing authorisation was terminated only on 1 January 2004. 1. 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO SR also found that 6 tax entities submitted sh in which the erroneous VAT number was reported, but the reports O_MCTL did not contain that VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the SR, the filed SH shall be transferred to the tax offices in electronic form and the data from them are sent to DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">Following the subsequent processing of this data in the VIES system, DR CLO will send to the competent tax authorities the so-called "tax authorities". breakdowns of errors in SH filed by tax entities for the relevant quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH as at 26. 7. 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and on 2 January 2005, the commission concluded that the information carried out in the draft member state of the member states concerned was not carried out in respect of the information provided by the Commission. 2. 2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the control).</seg>
<seg id="265">The following table provides a comparison of data.</seg>
<seg id="266">It is apparent from the above data that the inspection of the SAO SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with the wrong VAT number (on average 199 SH per quarter), but also on the reduction of the number of unrecedified errors in the SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-Community deliveries specified by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intra-Community deliveries specified by this payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">ADIS automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any uncertainties and use the data obtained to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, Cr found that the audited tax authorities did not check these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values shown in SH and DAP in these cases was 537 231 ths. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="272">From 3. In the quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values specified in SH and DAP in the amount of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community deliveries according to the SH as a match and set it up in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intra-Community deliveries for one quarter, 0,5 % of the value represents a not insignificant amount, therefore the tax authorities should not set the sh and DAP conformity in these cases without clarifying the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">E.g. without verification, the tax administrator set a consensus in the event of a difference in values of CZK 1,561,000. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="275">The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic was complicated by the fact that sh for each calendar quarter was submitted to the payer within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">For taxpayers with a monthly tax period at the time of dap filing for the first two months of the calendar quarter, the tax authorities could not compare the intra-community delivery values specified in these DAPs with those according to SH.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax authorities became aware of any data mismatch in DAP and SH only at the time when the tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was assessed, or Returned.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, among other things, the information on the values of intra-Community transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, the delivered data from sh submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) is processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, the data are converted at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the acquisition value indicated by the Czech payers in DAP for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the acquisition of goods reported by the payer in dap should be within the minimum and maximum recalculated values L1QD (L1min and L1max values).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in DAP is lower than the L1min value, the so-called "value" is generated for the payers with the most significant irregularities. the verification command.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders concerning audited tax authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, Cr found that the audited tax authorities in 33 cases did not check for irregularities in the values of intra-community acquisitions, to which the received verification orders pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="288">In these cases, the total difference between the values shown in sh by payers from other EU Member States and DAP was at least 148,319,000. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, Cr selected for inspection 533 files of tax entities for which the audited tax authorities received an verification order from MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The following common causes of differences between the values mentioned in dap of the purchaser and in the supplier's SH were identified by the inspection: on the part of the purchaser (Czech payer) in 263 cases the purchaser did not indicate the acquisition of the goods in the proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of the goods in a tax year other than that in which he was obliged to declare tax, in 6 cases the purchaser stated the value of the acquired goods in the wrong dap line , on the part of the supplier (eu payer) in 88 cases eu payers included in their SH the values of the services provided to the Czech payer, of which in 54 cases they were payers from The Czech Republic, in 39 cases the suppliers included in sh the delivery of goods in a different tax period than the purchasers from the Czech Republic in their DAP, in 22 cases the suppliers reported in the SH incorrect VAT number of the Czech payer , in 16 cases suppliers reported erroneous values of delivery of goods in SH, in 12 cases suppliers included in sh the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1. 5. 2004, in 5 cases suppliers included in sh the value of the advances received.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the sr payers' side, the value of the services provided was most often misclassification in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were identified in the audited tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="293">E.g. when examining the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 was between 10,974 and 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Czk was created by the fact that the Slovak payer was introduced to SH for 1. In the third quarter of 2005, the provision of services (construction works and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of advances received in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers reported in SH received advances from Czech payers, resulting in the generation of an order to verify the difference of 3,580 czk. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to validate purchased items are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where there is subsequently a change in SH data in EU Member States, such as the following: change of customer of goods in the Czech Republic or increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since VIES does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the local tax administrator may not be able to find out the facts relevant for the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">By checking the SAO, cr it was found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer stated in SH for 2. In the quarter of 2004, the value of the delivery of goods to the Czech payer amounted to CZK 1,504,000. Group.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1 January 2005, the Council adopted Decision On 2. 2005, the tax office sent a request for information to the locally competent Czech payer in the SR, because the Czech payer granted the acquisition of goods in the amount of CZK 425,000. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="301">On 1 January 2006, the Slovak payer submitted a complaint to the Slovak payer of the application of the tax procedure. 3. 2005 additional SH, in which he corrected the details of the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538,000. Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the amount of 194 ths. Sk to 1,160,000 Group.</seg>
<seg id="302">The four Slovak payers mentioned in their SH for 2. In the quarter of 2004, intra-Community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic totaled CZK 10,240,000. Sk (i.e. 8,183,000 (czk 100,</seg>
<seg id="303">However, czech procurers did not report intra-community acquisitions in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer who was not listed in the SH submitted by the Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the first period of 1 January 2004, the In the quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased in the additional SH related to 2. In total, the value of intra-Community supplies for this Czech payer was 10,240,000. Group.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts as to the correctness of the data in the dap filed for 2. in the quarter of 2004, even if the actual acquirer did not fulfil the obligation to declare intra-Community acquisitions for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, Cr found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the above-mentioned Czech payer was additionally charged VAT for the tax year 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640,000. czk and for 3. 3,305,000 czk in the quarter ended 304. czk from the acquired goods in these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">It is apparent from the above that tax authorities had to examine not only the differences caused by errors in the DAP by the acquirer in tax proceedings, but also the differences caused by the different reporting of intra-Community delivery and acquisition data in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="309">Unifying the conditions for reporting this data would lead to a streamlining of the control activities of tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In slovakia, the APV DIS system allows you to compare data on the value of acquired goods obtained through VIES from other EU Member States with those given in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which the data are compared is called the "MIN-MAX method".</seg>
<seg id="313">This method shall recalculate the values of delivery of goods listed in the SH by payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">There will be an MIN-MAX interval, which is used to compare with the acquisition values of goods specified in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CLO shall send tax authorities information on the intra-Community acquisition values specified in DAP and the values of EU delivery in VIES.</seg>

<seg id="354">dr clo to another EU country. The aim of the ZOI is, for example, to ensure that the proof of the execution of the transaction in the context of intra-Community transactions, examination of a particular VAT number, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax authorities in another EU member state.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of information exchange is regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for replying to the IOI was set in Article 2 of the basic Regulation. 8 of this Regulation for 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for the admissibility of applications are laid down by the Commission Decision of the European Communities of 15 December 2003 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to state aid to certain products covered by 11. 2004, which provides that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the IOC must cover commercial transactions of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">Where the ZOI concerns a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 net of VAT, the requested authority may refuse to reply with regard to its workload.</seg>

<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and the use of VIES for the exchange of information between EU Member States has been examined, in particular when monitoring the application of the right to VAT exemptions.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intra-community transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="371">By examining the transactions selected, it was found that, on the basis of the international exchange of information, the tax authorities of both countries revealed the cases of companies carrying out fictitious intra-Community business transactions in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not admit VAT on the received supplies of goods at the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the control identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The review also highlighted problems caused by the different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and purchases of goods in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="374">Unifying the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlining of the control activities of national tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="375">By examining the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the management of VAT and the use of the VIES system, it was found that the tax or tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="376">Furthermore, it was found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and on the validity of the registration of tax entities for VAT in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SA SAO compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with the data processed after the completion of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="378">It was clear from the comparison of these data that the inspection of the SAO SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with the erroneously mentioned VAT number, but also on the reduction of the number of unrecedified errors in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In the event of irregularities in the reported data, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such an option within the framework of the current legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The findings of the control action showed that VIES provided tax authorities with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Given that there is still room for tax evasion in this area, there is a need to pay increased attention to intra-Community transactions in the management of VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of value added tax administration and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material provides an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Najvy higher control office of the Slovak Republic, which focused on the area of value added management and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the supreme control offices of the two countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of parallel control actions has been chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenues of the state budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of value added tax, allowing the repayment of the excessive deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise duty, in particular for tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean a high profit for those who escape taxation by illegally selling such goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Given the need to address this issue comprehensively throughout the European Union, the highest audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union have created a working group of VAT Working Group, involving the most active control bodies of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest contribution of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in a joint effort to identify problematic areas of indirect tax administration in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience gained and the knowledge will be used in the framework of planned indirect tax controls, aimed primarily at involving tax authorities of both States in the VIES system, allowing for control of the movement of goods between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the control of value added tax and excise duties for the period 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Inspection number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>

<seg id="26">Objective of the scan</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the control actions was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of the financial and tax authorities and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duties, with a focus on the collection of these taxes on the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of the international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the relevant financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2002 and 2003.</seg>

<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">In the framework of international cooperation, the SAO forwarded 22,206 items of single customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic from the Czech Customs Database and, conversely, the SAO forwarded the SAO from the SR customs database 30 221 jcd items.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison of typed JCD items from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Czech Republic was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of the 5,883 selected JCD items from the Czech customs database, a total of 43% of related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 12,343 JCD items selected from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of related JCD entries were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the basis of unassigned JCD items, a selection of files of tax entities for which the reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was carried out at the financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="37">On the basis of the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the financial and tax authorities, the implementation of the reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified in the territory of the other state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO SR carried out a joint pilot check at the border customs crossing Stary Hrozenkov - Drietoma, in which the two parties cooperated closely in verifying the correctness of the data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The check did not identify weaknesses in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both Countries and highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="42">In the field of international cooperation, the control of the SAO and the SAO SR focused on imports and exports of spirits and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, and other types of goods, where appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of the inspection of the files of tax entities at the selected financial or tax offices, the SAO requested verification of the implementation of exports of goods reported to 40 JCD in the total statistical value of CZK 15,301,093 and the SR SAO on export verification at a statistical value of SK 56,989.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and the SAO found, inter alia, the following:</seg>
<seg id="45">- commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="46">- the error rate in entering data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- some exports from the Czech Republic have not been shown to be corresponding imports into the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="48">In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of undue application of value added tax deductions,</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax entities have not complied with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="50">- deficiencies have been identified in the activities of the tax authorities and the tax authorities in the management of value added tax and excise duties and in their cooperation with the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the field of value added tax and excise duties, international trade will continue to need to be addressed in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrations in the exercise of value added tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="53">Effective control of excise duties is the control of the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the status of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as 'VAT') was levied by the tax authorities or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out in the country and by customs authorities on importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">The tax revenues were determined by the difference between the selected own tax liability and the refunded excessive VAT deductions at the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="58">VAT revenues at customs offices were determined by the amount of taxes collected by them.</seg>
<seg id="59">The tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the deductions of the tax applied to the tax authorities or tax authorities in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most tax authorities or tax authorities, excessive VAT deductions outweighed the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the main taxes in terms of state budget revenue, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenues of the State Budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and about 42% in tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">In 2003, the total collection of VAT in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 162.9 billion. Czk.</seg>

<seg id="70">4. Course of control action</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage, a comparison was made of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic, in the second stage the results of this comparison were used in the mutual verification of the realization of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic and in the checks carried out on the territory of both states.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of the control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel CONTROLS of VAT and spd was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO SR in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held, at which, inter alia, the Commission adopted a meeting on the coordination of the European Union's foreign and private ly in the european union. agreed the selection of commodities - the types of goods that posed a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax regulations: - alcohol and spirits, tariff headings No. 2207 and 2208, - Tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings Nos. 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, subheadings No 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, customs tariff subheadings No 8525 20 91 , 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be made: a) from unassigned items identified by comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and The Slovak Republic, b) from entities carrying out imports and exports on a regular or one-off basis in large volumes, c) on the basis of findings from the checks carried out by the selected tax and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002 tested the mechanism for the mutual assignment of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, part of exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Czech Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the Customs Tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- Ethyl alcohol undenatured with an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or more; ethyl alcohol and other distillates denatured, of any alcoholic strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- Ethyl alcohol undenatured with an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80 % vol.; distillates, liqueurs and other spirit drinks,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with cut-off ends), cigarillos and cigarettes of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences,</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmitting apparatus containing receiving equipment: For the cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmitting apparatus containing reception equipment: Other,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subs and other subs falling within subs and other subs falling within subs and regulations 8525 10 50, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">JCD entries from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic were assigned to each other on the basis of the conformity of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle carrying the cargo, the date of crossing of the state border, the customs tariff item, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are shown in the following tables and charts.</seg>
<seg id="92">The intertriation of individual imports and exports made it difficult, inter alia, to export to the community. the fact that commercial transactions have not been declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic, declared on one export JCD, were declared in the territory of the SR to more import JCD, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that influenced the success of the assignment were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the records of the corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial and/or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to some tax entities that made imports or exports between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, which were not identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, some tax entities for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic were found in both databases were selected for verification of the business transactions reported in the VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot check at the Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma border customs crossing</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing for the pilot inspection was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="100">On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, the use of control sheets has been established at the border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic since 1.6.1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport carrying goods of a commercial nature in the customs area and to create the conditions for the comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot control was carried out on 8 and 8 December 2004. 3. 2004 to 26. 3. 2004 and was aimed at examining this customs control system.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of control sheets at the Border Customs Crossing of The Stary Hrozenkov-Drietoma:</seg>

<seg id="126">The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by the workers of the Drietoma border customs crossing and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The inspection of the SAO and the SAO SR did not detect deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected control findings for verification of business transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">In the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from the documents of customs administrations and financial or tax offices in the territory of the other state.</seg>
<seg id="130">For selected tax entities, the following have been verified:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="132">- fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the VAT deduction on imports, the refund of the excess VAT deduction and the application of the VAT exemption on export.</seg>

<seg id="142">The SA Found that this JCD corresponds to an import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9,653,827 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="143">VAT was paid in the Czech Customs Office in the Czech Customs.</seg>
<seg id="144">4. A company engaged in, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, did not show any exports of goods in the VAT vat returns filed in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the Czech Customs Database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 totalled CZK 3,439,888.</seg>
<seg id="146">On the basis of these facts, the SAO selected a total statistical value of CZK 669,839 to verify 5 export JCDs (5 items).</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) in the statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.</seg>

<seg id="153">In the customs database of the SR, the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCDs (9 items) was not identified in the total statistical value of CZK 399,776.</seg>
<seg id="154">The competent tax authority in the SR verified these imports with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity referred to on the JCD as an importer to the SR stated in the register of the local investigation that the imports declared on the Czech export JCDs did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO SR therefore asked the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate tax for the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</seg>
<seg id="157">6. According to the Czech Customs Database, the company engaged in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers in 2002 with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 and in 2003 a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545.</seg>

<seg id="161">The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 was not assigned to the corresponding imports in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7. The software company did not report exports of goods in vat returns for the years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the Czech Customs Database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630,198.</seg>

<seg id="166">The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 was not assigned to the corresponding imports in the customs database of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="167">In these cases, it was not possible to identify in the customs database of the SR corresponding imports to 6 JCD in the statistical value of CZK 692,800.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- to 2 export JCD from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the corresponding import JCD was not identified in the SR customs database (see paragraphs 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error rate in the entry of data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify certain registered imports, e.g. in the case of imports. in cases where the importer's name was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the 'VAT registration number').</seg>
<seg id="171">It is therefore not possible to conclude with certainty that these exports have not materialised.</seg>
<seg id="172">- the 4 export JCDs from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic have not been shown to be imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic at a statistical value of CZK 399,776 (see point 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of the dummy export of goods for the purpose of unduly applying the VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the control of selected financial or tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the files of tax entities inspected by the tax authorities have been selected according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic: a) with the highest volume of imports, b) with the highest amount of VAT assessed, c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>

<seg id="179">3. tax entities for which tax control has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="180">Sampling was carried out regardless of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Checking the selected sample at tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused in particular on the audited tax offices on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure for the tax authorities to verify the correctness of the VAT declared,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices, focusing on the comparison of the declared value, the application of the correct rate of VAT following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparison of jcd data and attached invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- a comparison of data from VAT returns on transactions carried out and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- the method of verifying the right to VAT exemption on the export of goods or services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services provided declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax authorities contained only records of those imports and exports which were obliged to include imports or exports to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited tax authorities examined the files of tax entities which reported imports totalling CZK 60 396 379 in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003. czk 12,644,052 thousand and the corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052, Czk.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the files of tax entities reporting in tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 were checked with exports totalling CZK 47 323,111 000. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Czech Customs Database, tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic were examined made imports to the Czech Republic from the Czech Republic with a total VAT base of CZK of CZK of CZK 3,759,352,000. CZK 767,607 thousand CZK, VAT czk and exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090 thousand. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="195">The differences found between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- jcd items, which were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic, were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- for JCD items that were missing from the tax authorities database, it has been verified that the documents are not cancelled,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items for which different values have been found between the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the database of tax authorities, the relevant JCD was requested in writing, including attached invoices, at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="199">The examination found that the JCD database at the tax authorities did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total VAT value of CZK 3 622 000. czk and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359 thousand. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences found</seg>
<seg id="201">By comparing the JCD database at tax offices and the accumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for the selected sample of tax entities, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="202">Differences in values were mainly caused by:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time shift between the implementation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT measured on imports of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The tax entity was able to claim the deduction of the tax on the importation of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the goods were placed under the procedure in question or, in the case of the temporary importation procedure, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax year in which the scheme was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time shift between the implementation of the export and the moment when the tax entity received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The tax entity was obliged to provide data on the export carried out exempt from the obligation to apply the output tax to the VAT return first for the tax year in which the goods exited the country, if it also had a tax document, which was the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to fulfil the obligations of tax entities in the reporting of imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax entities did not include the correct import and export information in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">Since the tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT declarations filed, it was difficult to check the right to deduct VAT or the exemption from VAT by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the period audited, import or export duties and VAT were refunded or remission by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax entities were obliged by law to reduce the previously claimed right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with considerable time delays and only from certain customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax authority did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data necessary to check the fulfilment of the legal obligation of the tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, the customs authorities returned VAT in an amount of more than EUR 319 million. in 2003 in the amount of over CZK 398 million. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with customs authorities and the non-fulfilment of certain obligations of payers submitting VAT returns and spd.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the management of VAT and the SpD, weaknesses were identified in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">(a) when vat registrations are revoked, compliance with the obligation of the payers to pay VAT on the business assets registered or which was to be registered on the date of the deregistration of the registration with which the payer applied the deduction was verified only occasionally,</seg>
<seg id="221">(b) the tax authorities have consistently failed to make use of the possibility of carrying out tax checks or local investigations.</seg>
<seg id="222">This in some cases resulted in insufficient verification of the eligibility of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">c) the official records and oral hearing logs did not contain all the necessary data to demonstrate the legitimacy of the excessive VAT deductions applied,</seg>
<seg id="224">(d) the tax authorities have not sufficiently verified the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in the SR</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Checking the selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For a selected sample of SAO SR verified or carried out a tax audit for the tax year 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the tax returns and refund requests submitted to the selected tax entities of the SAO SR, the tax office requested the provision of the relevant JCD proving imports and exports, invoices and proof of payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO SR checked whether the JCDs submitted were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the decisive facts and statutory conditions when applying the deduction of input tax on imports, on the refund of the excess VAT deduction, in the application of the exemption from export duty and when the SpD was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="230">The SAO SR verified at 10 audited tax offices selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the honor of jcd items and the sum of statistical values shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports were checked at a statistical value of EUR 856,2 million. Sk, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to the CFR.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked for a total statistical value of EUR 176 million. Sk, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">Furthermore, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white equipment, packaging techniques and software) from EU countries to the SR were checked for a total statistical value of EUR 532.8 million. Group.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO SR checked the tax offices to find discrepancies between the data recorded in the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (natural persons) mentioned in the tax returns imports of goods with a total value of 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed the right to recover excessive VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the initiative of the SAO SR, tax entities have failed to demonstrate to the tax authority the legitimacy of the application of input tax by the relevant evidence of the execution of imports and payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- the tax entity (s. r. o.) declared in the tax return for the tax year january 2003 the taxable transaction received in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and applied an excessive deduction of VAT of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">It is apparent from the VAT returns filed for 2003 that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of 59 161 535 Sk, which was established in January 2003, was not compensated during the whole of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above cases, the SAO SR asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excessive VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax year January to June 2002 indicated exports of goods with a total value of SK 87 199 in vat returns.</seg>
<seg id="242">Verification in the customs database of the Slovak Customs Database found that the tax entity carried out exports at a statistical value of 296 747 Sk during that period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Tax Office carried out a local investigation at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's executive (UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the inspection of the SAO SR, the tax administrator notified the law enforcement authorities of the suspected non-tax charge of the offence.</seg>
<seg id="245">On the basis of the results of the audit at the selected tax offices, the SAO SR notes that the biggest problems in the administration and control of VAT and the SpD were mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- non-use of the possibility of carrying out vat checks on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases of the application of the high value of excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="247">- the tax audit protocols did not contain an inventory of the documents checked</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient screening of the reported import and export of goods in the tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy proceedings by tax administrations in issuing decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, as well as the termination of the right to deduct sanctions,</seg>
<seg id="251">- non-compliance with the legal conditions in the provision of deferrals of payment of taxes,</seg>
<seg id="252">- non-compensation of VAT arrears within the time limit for the refund of the excess VAT deduction,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">On the basis of the identified deficiencies identified, the SAO SR requested the competent tax authorities to carry out a VAT tax check, focusing on the legitimacy of the excessive VAT deductions applied for 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to address the identified deficiencies, the fulfilment of which the SAO will monitor and control.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both Countries and highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The checks also resulted in the detection of persistent deficiencies in the fulfilment of the obligations of VAT and SpD payers, in the activities of financial and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and efficiency of tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="259">The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic within the framework of the tax information system. There is no similar system in the Czech Customs and Customs Administration of information on imports and exports of goods.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the enforcement of VAT and SpD administration was not the same due to the different rules and conditions in the territory of the two States.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from the information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from documents available at the audited tax offices. The SAO SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the event of irregularities being detected, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel controls carried out in the field of VAT and the SpD assessed the state of the administration of these taxes in the period prior to accession to the European Union and pointed out the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further intensified in the control of the activities of financial or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the supply of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of so-called 'goods'. recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be submitted by all VAT payers who have made the supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax authorities are obliged to enter recapitulative information data into the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) to which tax authorities from the Member States of the European Union have access.</seg>
<seg id="268">The tax authorities and tax authorities can then compare these data with the data given in the VAT returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is also used to verify the validity of the VAT registration number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the eligibility of the VAT exemption applied for the supply of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outcomes of the forthcoming control actions, which will focus, inter alia, on the verification of the VIES system, which is intended to prevent tax evasion in the so-called "tax authorities". 'intra-Community supplies'.</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and the SpD for budgetary revenues, control activities need to focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the phenomena that are of a global character and have become an inseparable part of the current development stages of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its cause is, in particular, the escape of citizens from their country of origin or last residence from persecution, in particular on grounds of racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to gain asylum and integrate into society, especially in one of Europe's advanced democratic countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">A large group is also made up of foreigners, whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the legal status of refugees, whose acceptance by the governments of the signatory countries had undertaken to apply them in their foreign policy orientation, has already been established.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federal Republics ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the adopted international documents and confirming their binding nature within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have also enshrined asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší control office of the Slovak Republic, the results of which include a joint final report, were focused on the asylum process and related issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Offices of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the 'Cooperation in Control Agreement' ('the Treaty') concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Treaty, the two Parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the State of the other Contracting Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to type the same problem circuits and to highlight the consequences of this for population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted of the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information to the extent laid down by the Treaty and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the first joint meeting, which took place on 5-4 June 2005, the European Union adopted a report on the european union's role in the 2007-2014 until 7.4.2004, the same areas of controlled issues and control procedures in the preparation of control actions were established.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place on 28 and 28 June 2006, the European Union decided to take the to 30.6. 2004, the common points for the control action programme were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the third joint meeting, which took place during the control action of 8.11. until 10.11.2004, the experience of ongoing checks was exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of outputs from the checks have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report drawn up on 14.2 have been specified. to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by inspectors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="26">The persons audited were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the Ministry of the Interior) and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, it carried out a review of the sectiona of the defence, vnútra and štátnych úradov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Technical Party (hereinafter referred to as the "MÚ").</seg>
<seg id="29">The period audited was 2001, 2002, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data over a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of experience gained between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyššší control office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange made it possible to evaluate the documents submitted more thoroughly, to analyse the causes of the identified differences in the security of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thus it was possible to focus on the decisive problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the end, this positively affected the quality of the inspection activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents ('the EU') has been the subject of the European Commission's evaluation reports on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation in this area continues after both countries have joined the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a continuously increasing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is mainly affected by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or non-granting of asylum, as well as the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some of the benefits collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the participants in the granting of asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="48">In asylum facilities, accommodation, meals, health care and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies are provided to asylum seekers during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organized within the leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, in the Czech Republic as well as integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one stay day depends on the occupancy and amenities of the resort and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is essentially stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1,000 places in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create conditions for applicants, the increasing number of which are expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the security of services. The decisive expenditure of this item was the expenditure on accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, the cost of healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant extent in total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the migration policy and the asylum process has been marked by many budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services were decisively involved in the utilisation of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of the state's assets.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were shortcomings, in particular, in the area of the use of state budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act, when actions with the technical appreciation of tangible fixed assets were covered by current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="61">The accounting law in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the chart of accounts was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">Furthermore, minor deficiencies in the management of the state's property were found in the Czech Republic when it was transferred to another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to report changes in the land register data violated the Land Register Act and the transfer of waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorised to dispose of the waste was violated.</seg>
<seg id="64">Furthermore, deficiencies in the granting of excessively high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in the procurement and management of state property were found in the Slovak Republic when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not established.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the applicable generally binding legislation governing the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">No deficiencies were identified in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some of the shortcomings identified, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší control office of the Slovak Republic positively assess the suz and the IO's progress in the provision of services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Building on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic note that despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation indicates that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the inspection were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the relevant organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the inspection be used in other joint control actions within the framework of the international cooperation of the SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 New York Protocol).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic, from 1 January 2005, the 1. 2000 effective Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and amending Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">There are currently two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd Amendment. and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding nature.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already in the framework of the adoption of this law, it was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum from 3. until 1 January 2005. the right of asylum has become part of Community law since 1.5. 1999 under the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has created the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. to create adequate legislation. to develop legal instruments in appropriate legal commitment.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports from the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community rules in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and their transposition period at the time of the inspection of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">Once they have been implemented into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary shelter in the Territory of the Slovak Republic has been established with effect from 1.1.1996 by the Law of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 283/1995 Z. z., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Law on Refugees has been replaced by Law No 480/2002 Z. z" on asylum and on the amendment and addition of certain laws, which incorporated the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 June 2001. 7. 2001 on minimum standards for the provision of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of effort between Member States in the reception of such persons and the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">Following two amendments to Act No 480/2002 Z z., on asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course on the basis of slovak language during their stay in the integration centre, the appointment of a guardian by the courts for minors, if they are staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship in certain circumstances, as set out in the amendment to the Law.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of Slovak law with EU law in the field of migration and the asylum process was evaluated in regular reports by the European Commission on the readiness to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report highlighted the lack of staffing capacity of the IOC, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters relating to refugees have been covered by the MV.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 January 2005, the 1. 1996, the MV established an organisational unit of the State of SUZ. The reason was the separation of the administration's performance in the area of the asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry of Asylum, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services for the MV to the parties to the granting of asylum proceedings and asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, it performs decisive tasks in the field of the IOC asylum process, in particular from the point of view of the financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific rules.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of applications for asylum granted to foreigners in the first stage of the administrative procedure and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it is preparing a concept for the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the development of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have significantly influenced cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">His financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum seekers was a particular contribution.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sports activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The evolution of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis, and in 2003 there was an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of asylum procedures in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">A total of 394 cases were granted asylum during the audited period, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">In the audited period, a total of 22,731 cases were not granted asylum and in 22 636 cases the asylum procedure was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="107">Number of parties to 1.1. includes both persons to whom no decision has yet been taken and those to whom the decision has not been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="108">It also includes persons who have been excused to miss the time limit for lodging an appeal or who have had the previous decision annulled and have not yet been issued a new one.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is on a steadily increasing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10 358.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8 131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 people applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of asylum procedures in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are given in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylums were granted in the audited period and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum procedure was stopped in a total of 23,088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">By staying outside the asylum facility without authorisation, the majority of applicants voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002, it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and more than 94% in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of stay of one applicant in one of the asylum facilities, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The findings of the Ministry of Y MÚ also show that for the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic, it is about finding better living conditions, i.e. the so-called 'asylum process'. economic migration, which does not have a foothold in documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases, the asylum system is used by the applicant for purpose.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as finding employment or better living conditions, is not a reason to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such a request should be made in accordance with the provisions of § 12 ods. Article 1(1)(b) (a) Act No 480/2002 Z. z., on asylum, is assessed as manifestly unfounded and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognised principles have not yet been established to identify economic migrants, distinguishing them from those persecuted in the country of origin and allowing the asylum process to be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of these facts, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration and western European countries have been and remain the target countries of migration.</seg>
<seg id="125">After accession to the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple special purpose applications for asylum in multiple EU countries from being submitted.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants return to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, so the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until a decision on granting or not granting asylum is granted.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Withdrawal of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and the national legislation based there.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly affected by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on granting asylum and also their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The increasing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher absorption of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food expenditure, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some of the benefits collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, in the controlled period, the subsistence allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money czk 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per stay day was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to pocket money, asylum seekers staying in residential centres with independent cooking and applicants staying in private outside the asylum facilities may be granted a contribution up to the minimum living wage.</seg>
<seg id="138">Law No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, grants, inter alia, in § 84 to municipalities the right to a contribution to cover the costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility in its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period it was CZK 7 per person per stay day.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are granted a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools frequented by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil per month in the controlled period, provided that in a given month the person attended the school for at least 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period there was a meal allowance of 70 Sk per person per day, pocket money 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per stay day was on average 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">In accordance with Act No 480/2002 Z. z., the municipalities in whose territory the asylum facility is located is granted a contribution for the partial reimbursement of the costs incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">So far, municipalities have only partially used the possibility to apply for a contribution, which is set at SK1 500 per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries for issuing an asylum decision sets a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure and at the same time allows, in justified cases, an extension of that period.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for the extension of the asylum procedure, which affects the amount of expenditure of the state budget, is to appeal against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of application for asylum (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures launched in 2001-2003 were finalised within one year of their initiation.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finalised.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to the data of the IOC, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the legal option of extending the time limit by bringing an appeal to court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases, it was an extension of more than a year and the proceedings were not closed in court at the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="154">Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint offices of the Ministry of Parties and the Úradahraničnej and Cudzineckej polecie Policajného zboru in reception centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vesi and in Liptovský Vlachoch, which was carried out during the period of inspection since 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This envisages simplifying procedures and reducing the time limits between the two components of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created appropriate conditions for the provision of services to the parties to the granting of asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="158">In asylum facilities, accommodation, meals, healthcare, pocket money and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies are provided to asylum seekers during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organized in the context of leisure activities and conditions are created for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing the state's assets in the premises of the Vyšní Lhota reception centre, the reception and residence centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was set up in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ also provides the operation of asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntále, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal person on the basis of § 80 para. 3 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of reception centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1,977 seats.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities, which asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic admissions operations referred to in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.</seg>
<seg id="166">A violation of the obligation to stay in the receiving centre is assessed as a misdemeanor.</seg>
<seg id="167">The residential centres where asylum seekers come from reception centres are used to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their application for asylum is taken into force.</seg>
<seg id="168">Under certain conditions, asylum seekers have the possibility to leave the residence centres or to leave the centres. to stay in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers shall have the right to free accommodation, food, other services and allowances in reception and residence centres where they are reported to stay, provided that they have endured the acts necessary to establish their financial and property conditions, and these ratios are such that they cannot be fairly requested or partially paid for those services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of an extension until they manage to secure adequate housing for them, or they will secure it themselves within the framework of the state integration program.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients pay all the costs of accommodation and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons granted refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1. Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">For comparison, asylum facilities were chosen as the best telling indicator of the cost per physical stay day.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the de facto number of persons who have actually been provided with services provided by an asylum facility on a daily record.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, the facilities operated by SUZ are designated as own and facilities operated by legal entities pursuant to Section 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one stay day in its own asylum facility operated by SUZ is falling as the fulfilment of these facilities increases. This is because the fixed cost of running the premises is calculated into more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers is increasing directly in proportion to the increasing number.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, there were accommodation for applicants in crisis capacity in their own asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to address the capacitive crisis of asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of Asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">The expenditure per applicant per per stay day was then lower in those years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, it is not possible to maintain a long-term high filling of these devices.</seg>
<seg id="185">Account should be taken of the risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated requirement for the need for higher accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments at fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum facilities operated by contract allows the adoption of operational solutions in the capacity of asylum facilities, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Ministry of Reception has adamov-gbely, rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residential centre Brezová pod Bradlom in its administration.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of reception centres is 470 seats and the residential center 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">The growing number of asylum seekers was dealt with by the Ministry of 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 00</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the concluded contract, the lease also provides the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the Ministry of 150 000 addressed the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Reception centres had occupancy rate of between 57% and 62% in the controlled period, on average from 33% to 50% in residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="197">Occupancy changed by the time of year and was the highest in the last months of the year when it applied for asylum for a much larger number of applicants compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 seats will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovskej Novej Vesi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">After the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006, the number of seats will increase by an additional 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1. Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the amount of the costs of operating the asylum facilities are given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body providing premises and ensuring the operation of the facilities, including the related activities, is one way to secure, at reasonable costs, the tasks resulting from the residence of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of funds and property of the State</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of economics</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, in 2001, suz's approved budgeted expenditure was increased by 13 budget measures by 103 077 ths. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of which 89 979 ths. Czk (87.29%) are earmarked appropriations. The bulk was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (44 538,000. and the provision of healthcare provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870,000) (czk 100,</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, SUZ expenditure was increased by 20 budgetary measures by 88 362 ths. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of which 62,282,000 were 100,000. (70.48%) were earmarked appropriations, of which the bulk (53 200 ths) czk) was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, SUZ expenditure was increased by 14 budgetary measures by a total of 88 078 ths. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of which 82 000 ths. Czk (93.09%) the purpose-built funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">Amount 51 000 ths. Czk 24,000 was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers. czk to deal with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000,000 Czk for the humanitarian evacuation programme of disabled residents of the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the drawdown of selected SUZ expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the above overview that the highest proportion of expenditure was spent on the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenditure incurred to purchase services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The heated expenditure under this heading was the costs of accommodation and catering for applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, the cost of medical treatment provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing security at individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suz's total expenditure accounted for salaries, work and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%).</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, purchases of material (approximately 14%) accounted for the total expenditure of SUZ, with the highest share of such expenditure was food purchases (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the MÚ's budgetary management for securing the migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures to address legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular, the draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part was characterised, in particular, in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the requirements of the IA, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs of their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, in particular in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter dealt with the disproportion during the year with several budgetary measures, which increased the limit of current expenditure in 2001 by 41,8 % and in 2002 by up to 71,7 %.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the use of selected expenditure by the Ministry of 30 June 2005 in the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums ranging from 24.47% to 30.51% and material and service expenditure ranged from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% were spending on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% of food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Spending on accommodation and catering services was another significant part of the share from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">A relatively low share in the range of 1.03% to 6.25% was capital expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Identified deficiencies</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar deficiencies which did not have a major impact on the management of the state's funds and assets.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were shortcomings, in particular in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the State Budget Act when actions bearing the technical appreciation of tangible fixed assets were covered by current expenditure; b) violation of the Accounting Act in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the indicative chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">Furthermore, minor deficiencies in the management of the state's property were found in the Czech Republic, when it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the land register data has violated the Land Registry Act; the waste law has been violated by the transfer of waste for disposal to a person who was not the person authorised to dispose of the waste.</seg>
<seg id="230">Furthermore, deficiencies were found in the Slovak Republic in the provision of excessively high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in the procurement and management of the State's assets when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, suz was at 1.7. 2002 introduced an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No. 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, interim and follow-up checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was established and an internal auditor of the SUZ was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year, the SUZ is issued a plan of financial, socially and operationally technical controls aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of funds and state assets in individual asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">In 2002, 42 management controls were carried out and 54 were carried out in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations is ensured by the Office of the Minister's control.</seg>
<seg id="237">Within the period audited, the implementation of the tasks in the asylum policy section was not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system of the Ministry of Cul is mainly aimed at carrying out preliminary and continuous financial control under Act No. 502/2001 Z. z., on financial control and audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The exercise of financial control is also governed by the internal regulations of the Director of the Ministry of Parties.</seg>
<seg id="240">The substantive focus of the control activity as part of the management of the various departments was established in the framework of the annual plan of the Ministry of 100000.</seg>
<seg id="241">The directors of the trade unions were responsible for carrying out the control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the written documentation submitted, no deficiencies were found.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the end of the regulation of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic No. 28 of 23. 4. 2004, the MÚ is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.</seg>
<seg id="244">In the next period, you will need to resolve the organizational security of this task.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel controls on expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, a united Europe would hardly be imaginable.</seg>
<seg id="4">High-quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living for Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and inexpensive transport of persons and cargo is an important task for the state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a very demanding task both in organizational and technical terms and in financial terms.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts for sustainable mobility often and hard to find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction of transport infrastructure, thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, constructions are financially demanding.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's considered procedures and decisions in the preparation and acquisition of transport works can bring significant savings in public financial resources that can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of the audit institutions is to actively identify weaknesses that have led to less than achievable cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">Control institutions should not only draw the attention of the government to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures that will improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (germany and the Czech Republic) the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH") and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as "SAO") carried out parallel checks on expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway (highway D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A17 motorway in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough inspection of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the basis of close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the amount of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction procedure, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award of the contract, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "ŘSD") made errors which led to an extension of the competition period and a reduction in the time for construction.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, the ŘSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the framework of the joint control work, the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 were compared, on the basis of the conversion into m2 of the area of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high cost per m2 area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges over 100 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the costs of building tunnels, the inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and the SAO now have a database of bridge and tunnel prices that they will be able to rely on in future efficiency checks on the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, both control institutions recommend: standardization of bridge constructions and the use of composite steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the main features of the collaboration was her team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel inspection, the inspectors participated in their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report informs about the progress and results of parallel checks on the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The controls focused on the cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel checks were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO checked the cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million from European funds (ISPA) was to be used as planned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to parallel checks carried out together with the SAO, BRH inspected the preparation and construction of the A17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A17 motorway amounted to around €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the trans-European transport corridor IV. Dresden – central and southern part of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 motorway runs from Prague via Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A17 motorway runs from the Czech/German national border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, border sections of both motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2005. They shall forthwith inform the Council of their information on the</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is completed all the way to Dresden, while the Czech side of the D 8 motorway is not completed, because section No. 0805 in the length of 16.4 km through the Czech Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section No. 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, in 2008, on the border section no. 0807 of the D 8 motorway, the traffic intensity should be 22,940 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, in 2010 the traffic intensity at the Czech border will amount to a total of about 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the connection of the German motorway A17 and the Czech highway D 8 to the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of parallel checks carried out by the two control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have negotiated close cooperation in controlling the construction of a motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both parties had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">SRN is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction rests on the ŘSD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out a check on this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically as regards the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to make sure that the expenditure was effective, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow for the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following the preparatory negotiations, on 4 December 2005, the Commission decided to consult the European Economic and The agreement on coordinated control of highway D 8/A 17 was signed by the Presidents of the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint working meetings between BRH and SAO inspectors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The negotiations addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the border bridge construction control and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">An important feature of cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the procurement procedure, the SAO has for the most part prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for control in the state administration differ in both countries in the way of closing control actions.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two SAIs have drawn their own control conclusions on their findings obtained during their checks.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved in parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on the date of completion of the construction of the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two sides then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">ŘSD was an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">SRN is financially involved in the construction of the bridge from 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the ŘSD proposed that the border bridge have a pre-stressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the ŘSD agreed to a coupled steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by a reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent ecological benefit of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, comparative calculations carried out by the SSD stated that a coupled steel-concrete structure should be a less costly option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">It stated that the new coupled steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the ŘSD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It has not prepared a custom-made dossier which adequately describes the assessment criteria and the sub-criteria for comparing tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the assessment and evaluation of tenders and the Director-General's assessment of the offers subjectively and problematic.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful tenderer challenged the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition resulted in the contract for the award of the construction contract being signed later than originally envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the summer construction season 2004, after evaluating the bids, was wasted and the time reserved for construction was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in less time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The procedure offered included double assembly of the bridge upper, a change in the construction of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of assembly areas.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was not able to get the originally proposed type of steel within the necessary deadline.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a cost of approximately €4 million, which had to be fully paid by the ŘSD – allowed the time to be carried out of the anti-corrosion protection, which in turn allowed the total construction time of the border bridge to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in funding.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced time reserved for works led to an increase in the price of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">At present, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices</seg>
<seg id="98">The two highest audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify accurately the relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two highest audit institutions have established the following principles for the comparison of bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge, excluding value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and the SNR and are subject to change); do not take into account the prices for the special foundations of the bridge; recalpose the prices in CZK to € at the European Central Bank rate applicable at 30 June 2006. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On the D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various structures (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of structure.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of structure were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the numerousness of the file allowed the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">Inspections found that the prices for m 2 concrete bridges on the D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price dependency on size was stronger than in The Czech bridges (see charts below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">To locate these bridges, a method was used to detect atypical values in a set of numbers and a regression analysis that takes into account the dependence of the bridge price on its size (for determining atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upwards).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should only be considered as an indicator of which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price should be analysed in each identified case.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be ineffective administrative measures, or environmental requirements or any other acceptable reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on the D 8 are higher than at A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two possible causes of this condition have been identified during the joint negotiations:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate orders.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional companies to take part in the contract competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of the contract for part of the highway route, which is several kilometers long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such competitions because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic there is more variability in bridge structures than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of construction of the bridge was decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision shall be taken at the time when the ŘSD translates the application for a territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, the ŘSD selects bridge types from several variants, but economy plays a smaller role in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be expressed on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel-concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of tunnels on D 8 are twice as high as those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, the comparison of the main structural and technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with the tunnels in Germany did not show any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, a small number of tunnels did not allow for the general conclusions to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="136">The efficiency and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden motorway – Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the concept of the development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No. 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be acquired before the frontier section No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 motorway as part of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">In programme No. 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 Motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – State Border of the Czech Republic/Germany" set two objectives for the construction of the D 8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection of Prague and Ústí nad Labem – national goal;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection between Prague and Berlin under IV. trans-European transport corridor Berlin-Istanbul – an international objective.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of a section leading through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No. 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of a section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">Actions are not finalised.</seg>
<seg id="152">It cannot therefore be ruled out that the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed a few years later than stated in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of section No. 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective – improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The ŘSD carried out an estimate of capital expenditure for frontier section D 8 No. 0807 and section No. 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains in the years 1999 – 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate for these capital expenditures included in the investment costs is about €639 million combined for both sections No 0805 and No 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of economic assessment (EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">All the highways under consideration and expressways opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the frontier section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All the highways under consideration and expressways opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the frontier section, the traffic intensity of 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All the highways under consideration and expressways opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the frontier section, the traffic intensity of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section across the Czech Central Mountains would be completed on time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">Costs for both sections excluding VAT, as at 31 December 2004, are not payable to the total amount of the total amount of the taxable amount of the total amount of the taxable amount of the year. 12. 2005, were €897 million, i.e. €897 million. higher by 27,4 % than the level of costs worked by the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be routed on a different, more costly route, which would affect the above-mentioned threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis has shown that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for a missing section through the Czech Central Mountains calculates a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="171">With the higher load on the round routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which was not calculated in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above reduction in revenues and cost increases mean that the eirr was not achieved as low as the construction of the border section D 8.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">There was also a similar cost overrun during the construction of the A17 motorway as in the case of these two sections on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for Long-Distance Transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany calculated the cost of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost-to-income ratio was then 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have soared to about €670 million, and the cost-to-income ratio has more than halved.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to parallel checks carried out together with the SAO BRH, in 2003 and 2005, he inspected the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="179">The BRH found that the competent approval state authority requested a field tunnel for section 3 A 17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the inspection action, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">The result was to achieve savings that amounted to around €10 million and €0.15 million in annual operating costs alone.</seg>
<seg id="182">When assessing the first section A 17 BRH, it found that the construction project was not properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the road construction administration did not carry out a survey of the conditions of the bedrock in the Dölzschen rocks, because the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was carried out only after the tunnel punching machine hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks inside were more weathered than anticipated during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures such as mooring, injection and stone-falling protection nets had to be taken, which required about €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Directorate of Roads and Motorways had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as safety measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also of measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs associated with the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training of drilling workers (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to project overruns (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which did not correspond to any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">On the basis of the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH requested the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction work.</seg>
<seg id="192">In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Directorates of Roads and Motorways the necessary impetus to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">The benefits of cooperation for BRH and the SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, assignment and progress of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both supreme audit institutions have built a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future controls will be able to be relied on.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main building and technical parameters of the bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the parameters A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The inspectors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use in further checks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds to finance projects implemented under the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="3">The developing community of the people of Europe is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let us therefore give this Community an introductory word on this joint report of the two Supreme Audit Institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (i.e. 37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral areas, often a relic of darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help to alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help to develop the napping potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover coastal areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most of the programmes are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last for seven years and a total of EUR 5.7 billion is earmarked from the EU budget. Eur.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Programmes shall include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, medical facilities, research centres, flood measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or the development of tourist objectives, development of joint services for the local population, employment advice, the creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the Programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The funds shall be provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characteristics: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the framework of the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of the project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: joint selection of the lead partner, joint preparation of the project and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, taking over the overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, total payments of support accepted by the lead partner and transferring them to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out in the territory of the regions and voivodeship adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2005, the Council adopted Joint Action The European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation czech republic – Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS CR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">€258,187,467 has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from the European Funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be spent by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the implementation of EU funds from the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The Agreement on the Cooperation of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27 December 2004. In September 2012, following previous negotiations at the Heads of SAEs of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia held in Lovasberen, Hungary, on 25 February 2013.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to verify whether the implementation of the operational programme is carried out in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system is functioning reliably, whether the objectives of the operational programme are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the aid granted.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel control, in which the control authorities independently examined, on the basis of their statutory mandate, topics the content of which had been jointly discussed in advance.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit carried out also included elements of the performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The checks carried out resulted in control conclusions published normally by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the basis of the two control conclusions set out in the Annex, this joint report was produced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1) which fall under aid 1.1 — Strengthening transport accessibility and support area 2.2 — Promoting the development of tourism.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the inspection, the use of funds from these two areas of support accounted for more than 60 % of the funds paid to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects throughout the OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to checking the joint sample of six projects, the SAO checked the other 13 projects and NIK checked two other projects (all from the support area 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to the beneficiaries of ERDF support, which were controlled by the SAO and NIK, totalled €25,362,174 (SAO) and €8,450,784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The amount of funds audited represented 41 % of all appropriations paid to beneficiaries of aid from areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both independently carried out by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of the irregularities identified did not exceed the level of materiality.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of OPPS ČR–POL, which includes the operation of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited persons who were part of the management and control system have taken steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and the non-use of erdf funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Proof of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the stated objectives, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THE INSPECTION</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of the control and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out a check of the control and control system of OPPS ČR–POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development pol) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodeship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the review focused on activities carried out in connection with the setting and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of the progress made, the evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the implementation of the programme's funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies , together with the control activities of the managing authority, the setting of activities and the results from the audits of the audit body and the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance, coordination of tasks and cooperation between the institutions involved in the OPPS CR-POL was also verified.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the field of risk analysis and the drawing up of control plans at the site of project implementation were examined and the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The verification of the control system included a review of the administrative and on-the-spot checks which allowed the approval of e.g. the control system. the supply of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, and at the same time the compliance of the disbursement of such funds and the related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant deficiencies were identified by the SAO's control in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, the risk of non-transparency of this process was identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other shortcomings were identified in the area of setting up monitoring indicators and in the setting of the irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">On the basis of these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities detected by NIK concerning the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to infringements of the laws and rules in force were not assessed as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a material impact on the implementation of the whole OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified irregularities, NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The check did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and the objectives set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all audited projects, the expected results were achieved, the activities financed were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the operational programme project applications were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of projects described below in the text.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect, which the SAO and NIK have addressed in their conclusions, is the limited possibility of objectively assessing the implementation of the project expected results with regard to the objectives of individual projects as well as the objectives of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On the initiative of the Supreme Control Chamber, an opinion poll was conducted in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation was carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nyse (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both to the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey mainly concerned the suitability, quality, exchange of information, the use of funds and the social function of projects, including investments implemented.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents for each project is set out in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social evaluation of the projects was good and was 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both with regard to the objectives and according to other parameters given in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents, the projects examined met the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noticed the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, the quality of life of citizens and the restoration of contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the targets/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by the respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of the participants in the panel discussions (target groups) carried out under the NIK control on the Polish side, who pointed out the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and the fulfilment of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of the legality of controlled projects</seg>
<seg id="74">For the beneficiaries, the compliance of the project in kind and time with the schedule and content of the project application was verified, the fulfilment of the objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in projects, the management of any project revenue, the fulfilment of the obligation to separate accounting of project transactions, compliance with the prohibition of financing of projects from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions , the fulfilment of mandatory publicity concerning, in particular, the dissemination of awareness of the sources of EU project funding, compliance with the eligibility conditions for project expenditure, the selection of suppliers and the verification of the supplies delivered on the basis of the public contracts awarded.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the deficiencies of qualified SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found at €85 094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the established materiality level relating to the total amount of funds audited for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the irregularities found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively to the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the obligations resulting from the conditions of the aid were properly fulfilled by the beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">However, seven of the eight beneficiaries of the aid audited by NIK were found to be irregularities in the fulfilment of material and financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, but which did not affect the choice of supplier or the supply of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of all NIK-controlled projects, the irregularity found concerning non-compliance with reporting obligations can be assessed as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which EUR 8 231 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2,098,053 (of which €76,863 financed by the ERDF) in three of the 19 projects audited.</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included the failure to deliver the material paid and the work or expense of upgrading the property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary or as a project partner.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public procurement and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel control carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The award of public contracts for goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the State is to make the most efficient and economical use of public resources and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the Single Economic Area.</seg>
<seg id="7">The EU has set limits in its rules, exceeding which the contracting authority must meet certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unhindered competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose european procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts that are valued below EU limits, the regulation of their award remains within the scope of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption, with a subsequent high potential for damage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair favoritism (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to carry out parallel controls in the field of procurement procedures and to prevent corruption in land and transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The controls also included procurement below European limits in order to cover the area of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The control findings of the two SAIs are summarised in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Areas of control and controlled institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH evaluation is based on area checks of the above mentioned areas, which were carried out by the German building authorities responsible for federal transport and construction between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, highway construction and large-scale construction projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The BRH included the findings of past controls in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO's evaluation is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which were focused on road constructions, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, federal procurement is mostly carried out by the provincial building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the state institution for road and rail construction is responsible for the award of public contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of civil engineering, public procurement is carried out by the beneficiaries of budgetary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at the various stages of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation takes into account the differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the course of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and statutory standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts .</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details on the requirements of european procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called 'european procurement law'. procurement manuals of the federal government, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail in the light of legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation concerning contracts with value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law undertouched substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up space for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fundamental aspects of the procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and narrower procedures must be applied in both countries in particular.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts under the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedures), but these are practically identical to the above conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of the preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and when called to participate in a competition, any candidate may submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved mainly by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and by dividing it into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">The award of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the proceedings to as many candidates as possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of the German procurement law are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must also be applied in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is a simplified sub-limit procedure where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, the Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current Czech legislation allows contracting entities to choose between open procedures and narrower procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">The total volume of contracting authority contracts for public works and the share of the different types of procedures in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction work in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">czk, of which CZK 1,138 billion was CZK (15%) the proportion of public contracts, which, in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of federal road and construction projects (excluding the construction of railways and water works) amounted to EUR 212.5 billion. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal contracts for land works and transport works was as follows: 80,7 % open management and public calls; 12.7% narrower management and narrower challenges;</seg>
<seg id="55">6,6 % of negotiated procedures and direct procurement; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to EUR 118.6 billion. czk , which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction work.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, it amounted to EUR 194.0 billion. 37% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14.3 % narrower procedure; 9,5 % of the negotiated procedure; 8,4 % simplified procedures for sub-limit contracts; 2.7% other proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="59">Those figures shall include all public procurement contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The figures show that: parallel controls in both countries have focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; corruption prevention, which must still be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open meaning. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel controls on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on preventing corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The controls were aimed at comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="64">The following are key findings:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national rights of both countries (paragraphs 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">The prevention of corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in terms of focus and in detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the basic requirement that the tender documents must meet is to include all the information needed to prepare tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specifications shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements limiting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, the division of contracts into parts is required where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to brh findings, this requirement is being complied with in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">Sao's checks have shown that in the Czech Republic, very large public works in the field of road constructions are commissioned, without being divided into parts, or divided, but only in a very significant part of it. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Such constraints on market potential may result in a significant increase in costs and create a risk of non-serious pricing practices and inadmissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting entities to subsequently enter additional works under certain conditions if this need arises only after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for the correct identification of the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, according to the applicable regulations, contracting entities can arbitrarily designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a narrower procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">German rules in the procurement and budgetary law give priority to open procedures for both European tenders and national, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger number of candidates to submit tenders and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it difficult to negotiate prices illegally between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results are achieved in terms of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts whose estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the contracting entities audited have always awarded European tenders.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct determination of the expected value of the contract plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish preliminary information and notices of the opening of the procurement procedure in order to increase competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">When selecting candidates to participate in a shortlisted procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and shall be published well in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should take turns as often as possible to encourage candidates to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements for the prevention of manipulation risks.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the contracting entities audited did not comply with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions have not always been credible (section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting entities must ensure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreement between those candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of specifications shall be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid any reduction in competition in the form of unlawful agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the German contracting authorities audited did not comply with that requirement in several cases (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">The labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements of tenders are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of tenders is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but have not always been respected by the contracting authorities under review.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities forwarded their tenders to third parties for inspection without prior consideration without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">Thus, the tenders were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (section 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">The intended award of the contract must be discussed by the participants for the sake of legal protection, enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The procurement documents were not always complete or entirely credible for the contracting authorities audited in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level have not always been properly respected in the management minutes.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some of the shortcomings identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the guiding principles of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European Procurement Law</seg>
<seg id="117">The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works, supplies and services in order to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures for the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (Review Procedures Directive) , the two directives were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">Eu general procurement principles include, in particular: a competitive environment requirement; the requirement of equal treatment or non-discrimination; transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, eu procurement principles include the Directive on the coordination of public procurement procedures, including provisions on construction projects whose total estimated value is or exceeds EUR 5 million. €.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the content of the tender documents; the type of procurement procedure used; disclosure of certain information before, during and after the proceedings; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of candidates; selection criteria for the most appropriate bid.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Review Procedure Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of the procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the examination procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In either country, there is no legal definition of what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is seen as an abuse of personal (confidential) status for its own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is incited by those who benefit.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">It is estimated that the total corruption-related damage is 5% of the world's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU region, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved in the contract, conventions restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, capacity and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, the prevention of corruption is an essential task of the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practice and procedures must be checked, in particular in areas particularly prone to corruption, in order to take adequate measures to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of works contracts is generally considered to be particularly prone to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures in the field of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which is particularly relevant to active and passive bribery, the recruitment and offering of significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis: the preference for open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of the planning, procurement and accounting phases; the precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, another preventive action against corruption has become part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system for monitoring the procurement of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed to identify possible irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, as is the case with the level of labour or civil law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were set out by the government in the Government's Strategy against Corruption for the period 2011 to 2012, which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of these measures were incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the limits for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notification by the contracting authority, including the justification of the contract; a ban on limiting the number of tenderers in a restricted procedure and abolishing the general possibility of limiting the number of applicants by drawing a draw; the obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; the obligation to publish actual and subcontracting lists.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of controls relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender documents</seg>
<seg id="150">The tender documents shall contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documentation shall allow the tender price to be processed.</seg>
<seg id="152">In order to do so, tenderers must not be exposed to risks they could not count on.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents contain, in particular, specifications, the requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">European law contains, in particular, requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Specifications must minimise competition and all interested parties must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">Specifications must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of corruption prevention is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, the documentation should avoid ambiguity or inaccurate data that create scope for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that specifications are generally given without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specifications shall specify the required supplies and services and specify in detail the number of units of work and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be quoted by units of work or supplies (e.g. in CZK/m or IN CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Defining the required work in terms of their functionality is permissible only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that specifications need to be drawn up completely and unequivocally.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain exact quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not entirely obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payment in the form of lump sums or according to the time worked shall be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documents shall exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare his tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender must be made public only if the tender documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for the contractor to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts, provided that the nature of the subject-matter of such a contract so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule to divide works into parts is required, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific aspects (specialised parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows even SMEs to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential applicants and makes it difficult to fix prices.</seg>
<seg id="179">This kind of input is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, the tender documents must contain evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the tenderer comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria according to which the tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European calls for tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include the evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">When tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion of any information that would help identify specific companies, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other undesues competitive advantages without the contracting authority's knowledge, thanks to contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish tender documents and make them accessible for screening.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only point of contact for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, after the conclusion of the original contract, there is almost always the need for more work or modification of existing works.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries allows the same supplier to award a multi-work contract within a certain limit without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of multi-work under European and German legislation must not exceed 50 % of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, more work must be necessary and must be of the nature of a specific part of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied to multi-work.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may risk a greater time delay in the implementation of the contract and the possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where a multi-work contract is awarded to a supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified work or multiple works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to more work, there may be less work during construction, i.e. less work. work that was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, less work and more work cannot be compensated for.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">Bhr</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but they were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications contained data requiring a particular trade mark, e.g. for the system of resistance of public inscriptions, for the prevention of water penetration or for noise-cancelling compresses, although this was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications broken down into items</seg>
<seg id="206">In a single case, the BRH did not notice a non-conformity with the general requirements for the call for supply and service tenders according to the quantitative specifications broken down into headings.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, tender documents were drawn up in full before the invitation to tender was published.</seg>
<seg id="209">However, in various cases, documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the items or timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, the tender documents contained work and supplies, the need of which was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender document for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Division of the contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for notdivising the supplies was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">For the criteria for evaluating tenders before the award of the contract, BRH did not find any shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of the names of authorized independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many of the documents included interested authorised experts.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names were given on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">For construction projects, these cases were found mainly in the procurement documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the processing of specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">Contracting entities stated that they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to closely examine the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="221">Sao</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 apartments, the reference was directly to the specific manufacturers and brands of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not accept the use of other similar types of products or to justify the request for the supply of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of the university's facilities, the tender documents contained references to specific business companies and specific product designations.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overall overview of specifications and sub-specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the procurement documents the quantity and type of work, supplies or services required in the acreage statement and set only the built-in space in cubic metres as a unit of measure for each building.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender documents for the narrower procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the contract and the change in technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">In the construction of social buildings, the tender documents had defects that forced the creation of multiple works (lack of precise focus, insufficient structural technical survey, lack of drawings).</seg>
<seg id="232">In the tender documents for the construction of a large library, the interior elements were listed only descriptively, without specification of the quality requirements for products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of interior equipment of the building was provided by subcontractors, who acquired some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for awarding a contract</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to award a contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">The analysis of three major road works during the construction of the road circuit showed that savings of up to 790 mil could be achieved when commissioned in open-drive in parts (separately after selected buildings). Czk 15,508 million of the public procurement price achieved. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, the award of six buildings as a separate part of the public contract could have achieved a saving of EUR 62.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="238">Czk, i.e. czk 100,0 25 % of the contracted price and the award of 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract could achieve a saving of EUR 287,8 million. Czk, i.e. czk 100,0 also 25%.</seg>
<seg id="239">When constructing roads, the contracting authority established qualification criteria in the procurement documents which limited the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the terms of the open procedure for the supplier for one construction of the motorway construction, the contracting authority requested, inter alia, the contracting authority to grant the contracting authority a contract for the construction of the motorway. the supplier's practice of implementing at least three road works with a financial volume of more than EUR 700 million each. completed or operational during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic there are only nine companies that meet the condition of completion of buildings over 700 mil. czk in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of other open-management motorway constructions included six separate buildings for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of construction work in the last three years of EUR 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of EUR 13.2 billion, the commission was responsible for the total of EUR 13.2 billion in 2004. There were only two or even one candidate.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential could lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Multi-work area</seg>
<seg id="247">The contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of multiple works of construction during the construction of the road circuit and did not award any of the procedures specified in the act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of the pre-approved multi-work in one case was EUR 1 591.4 million. Czk without VAT (increase of 21 %) and in the latter case 4 135,8 mil. czk without VAT (increase of 91 %).</seg>
<seg id="249">The cause of the multi-work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the construction of the higher education institution, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents some works and supplies, the necessities of which he knew about the necessary for the completion and approval of the construction when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and supplies he concluded additions to the contract for work with the contractor with an increase in the price, in the negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of multi-works exceeded the national limit of 20 % of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the palace of justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to enter additional works without a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by EUR 50.5 million. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices of additional works fixed without competition were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same supplier.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On the selected sample of buildings, the SAO found that the average construction costs of building one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic are 355.0 mil. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany for a mileage of a four-lane motorway is 260.0 miles. Czk.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions on tender documents are almost the case in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow candidates to calculate costs and prepare their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="263">In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to commission more work.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by additional rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for the implementation of manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, there is greater transparency achieved by the publication of the procurement criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries, the requirements for specifications are mostly met.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases deficiencies have been identified which could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">At the same time, a rule in Force in Germany requiring the division of bulky construction projects into parts seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-scale projects without awarding in parts or division into large volumes can limit the circle of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">The strict requirement for applicants' references, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of candidates for road works, is the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small number of applicants, so that small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of applicants also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal conventions.</seg>
<seg id="272">As regards the award of additional contracts for more than work or modified work and their reimbursements, regulatory approaches are different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the multi-work may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the 20 % limit is exceeded, more work must be entered on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing the works into parts, it is possible to avoid the reduction of competition and the subsequent unfortunate consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers who will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting authority may leave the range of potential suppliers unrestricted or limit the scope according to the specified criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of major project works, the value of which reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing a type of procedure, the contracting authority must in particular comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of EUR 5,0 million, the commission shall, in the absence of any other information, be required to provide the total cost of the contract with the required works. € (EUR 125 million) it is always required to open or restricted a procurement procedure at European level.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue shall be admissible.</seg>
<seg id="288">Where a construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, derogate from the European procurement procedure by asking for a national procedure if the total value of the part concerned is below the limit of EUR 1,0 million. € (EUR 25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimate of the whole contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or deliberately estimating its costs too low with the intention of avoiding a fundamental obligation to issue a European procurement procedure is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">The choice of the type of management is very important for the prevention of corruption, as the restriction of competition significantly increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, an important part of the procurement procedure documentation is a detailed justification for the type of procedure chosen, in particular in relation to the obligation to application of the European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures as well as for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are allowed only if the conditions laid down by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of corruption prevention prefers open procedures or a public invitation to participate in proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted proceedings, shall be permitted only exceptionally if permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions shall be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of open management preference is intended to ensure that restrictions on competition are avoided to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (selected by specific candidates in advance) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is at the heart of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimate of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for the decision on the corresponding type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the cost of construction projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on budget and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of buildings, building units, building parts and partial works.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such cost baselines, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or construction work.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable buildings to determine the expected costs of public contracts for construction sites.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the cost determination is based on an estimate by the entity that finances the project or is based on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">The standardisation measures are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the basis of the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of the usual prices of standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The application of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by a new Regulation ordering the subject matter of the contract to be determined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly works, materials and products and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport constructions for the purpose of their inspection, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended for determining the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of the preparation of the works.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The contracting entities audited generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of civil engineering was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this proportion was 94,8 %.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of a blanket check, BRH found, on the basis of information collected from more than 16 000 proceedings, that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public management and public challenge, and limited management also increases the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, the tender prices in the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure were between 6 % and 10 % higher than in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies of the Ministry of Construction and the Provincial Control Court confirmed differences in value for money raised in public and limited management.</seg>
<seg id="327">A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in limited management were twice as high as those in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total contract value was estimated at more than EUR 5 million, the total value of the contract was estimated at eur 5 million. € (EUR 125 million) as a rule, the contracting entities audited prepared tender plans specifying which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the tender plans, the proportion of works commissioned under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">There was no case of circumvention of the european procedure requirement by means of an excessively low cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases, the minimum share for pan-European management was not reached as a result of the calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of carrying out the work, some contracting authorities have illegally changed the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these amendments and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of the European procedure would subsequently be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a general rule, the share of European procedures under project accounts was lower than that set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected values of construction project contracts exceeded European limits, the contracting entities did not use the European procedure for all the individual sub-sections in value exceeding EUR 1 million. € (EUR 25 million) (czk 100,</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving valid reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">Sao</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of the type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several major construction projects (e.g. road section construction, equipment for a major sporting event and the construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding mode or even outside the law.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the estimated price</seg>
<seg id="343">The price norms applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the projected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices mentioned in the completed proceedings, but they were affected by both wastefulness and excessive profit by suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the road were about 37 % lower than these price norms.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the norms in relation not only to prices from the past, but also in comparison with other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For building constructions, the estimated price was based on the project budget carried out by architects or on the investor's estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then differed considerably from the projected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but increased by EUR 54 million during the implementation. Czk, i.e. czk 100,0 by 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the estimated price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the estimated price and increased even higher during the implementation process.</seg>
<seg id="352">It was about 400 miles in the construction of a large library. Czk, i.e. czk 100,0 by 22%. For the construction of a palace of justice, the actual price increased disproportionately during the construction process (by 139 %) compared to the increase in functional areas (only by 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of type of procurement procedure and on respect for European limits in their national legislation, so that the relevant national adjustments of both countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public proceedings in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national arrangements in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public invitation to participate gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of tenders that guarantee the best value for money effect.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the circle of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives scope for manipulation and fixation of prices between tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the benefits of the German provision on the preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contracting entities to award contracts in an open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban on contracting authorities from limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">The closer procedure has now come very close to an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authority is largely satisfied with the requirement of an open procedure preference or a public call for competition, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided in breach of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to select the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects carried out in Germany, european limits were not respected, resulting in the failure to achieve a minimum share in pan-European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">A satisfactory system has not yet been put in place in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, by means of more extensive controls, that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met or they should create the conditions necessary to enable the expected costs to be calculated correctly.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded under a European procedure, the contracting authority shall publish a contract report.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and contract notices are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">By means of advance notifications, the contracting authority shall indicate the basic specifications of the intended projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary notifications are required for projects for which the estimate of total costs is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority shall publish a contract notice with detailed information on all public contracts requiring a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information shall be binding on the contracting authority after publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notification shall contain specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weights.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common procurement vocabulary must be used to describe the subject-matter of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU's Official Journal and on the sponsor's profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to prevent discrimination against foreign applicants, notifications at national level should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notification to the EU Publications Office is sent.</seg>

<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>

<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small orders in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">Dividing projects into smaller parts is not so common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Pre-notification</seg>
<seg id="396">Contracting entities published a preliminary notification of projects which included works to be commissioned in the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between sending a pre-notification and sending a contract notification was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other abbreviated procedures, the annual periods applicable to the provisional information have expired and should have been renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the envisaged division of the works into several parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="401">Some notifications contained codes from the common dictionary that departed from the content of the pre-notification or did not specify the exact work to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="402">In rare cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. terms or published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting authority has hired an external company to publish a national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published a notice on its platform, the use of which was charged.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authority did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to send further notices to a free internet government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">Sao</seg>
<seg id="409">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="410">In the construction of the waste water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set criteria in the notification of a shortlisted procurement procedure to the contractor for the construction, according to which it would reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The method of selecting (reducing) the evaluation tenders was not able to be demonstrated by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="412">Previous legislation allowed for a reduction in the number of offers.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the construction of the road circuit, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice of initiation of a restricted procedure or in the qualification documentation the values according to which it will assess the level of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of candidates to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the shortlist met it, but excluded one of them, having fulfilled only the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what of the qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of calls</seg>
<seg id="417">In the 1990s, the contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to submit tenders in the former military raids.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-step information process with preliminary information and the publication of notices of initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency requirements and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of limited procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow participation by all potential tenderers who would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the contracting authority first selects potential suppliers to be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow the number of applicants in European restricted procedures to be limited.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, a restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and at least three potential tenderers must be invited in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently wide to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is very prone to manipulation, e.g. by the selection of potential candidates who will be invited. preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders can ease their secret deal.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control in order to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting entities should amend tenderers who invite tenders to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three tenderers are required in the event of a restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in the case of negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except in two cases, the new Czech rules do not allow to limit the number of candidates addressed in the case of a closer and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, when selecting candidates, the 'four-eyed principle' must be respected.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes a list, another has to substantially modify the proposal, e.g. in the form of a list of the product. by deleting the proposed tenderer or by the introduction of another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively determine the circle of tenderers who participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">If such a provision is not in place, a far-reaching illegal agreement between the parties shall be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="447">This also obliges authorized independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor a measure for confidential treatment of the list of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to German provisions, they may not designate candidates from external companies, but they may make proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="453">Number of leads</seg>
<seg id="454">Apart from a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of applicants has been met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7 000 assignments for buildings with a value within the national limit showed that, in the case of restricted procedures, contracting entities invited an average of 6.6 potential tenderers and, in the case of direct negotiated procedures, an average of 4.4 tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in the area of building construction, the contracting authorities did not change the circle of candidates addressed because they had good experience with those with whom they had cooperated so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they should guarantee that they would reach out to tenderers whose suitability they had already assured.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the non-public tenders included a greater proportion of regional applicants than there were in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-check principle and proposals of self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">Contracting entities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">In particular, they argued for staff shortages, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who suggested the tenderer who was asked to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="466">The examination of certain samples showed that the list of potential candidates was created by self-employed experts and was adopted without modification by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the contracting authorities did not sufficiently protect themselves from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of the treatment of lists of potential tenderers</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority kept a list of tenderers for invitations to the procurement procedure in a database to which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed the names of the envisaged or accepted tenderers to be manipulated or unauthorized to be disclosed, who could then agree on the price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The dossier provided reasons for the selection of candidates only in a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">Sao</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for the selection of candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the road circuit, the interested parties did not have information on what data on their qualification would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For an action related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the notification of the procurement procedure for participation in a restricted procedure, criteria have not been laid down to limit the number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then carried out the selection of tenderers by the method of random selection – by drawing, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have already been indicated as a criterion in the contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning tenderer in limited procurement procedures, the two countries have put in place special measures to prevent the illegal restriction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called "black-and-green" manipulations. cross-checking (four-eye principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of candidates and by prohibiting proposals for the selection of candidates to external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the check found that part of those rules had not been applied sufficiently and that an inadmissible restriction on the ring of candidates had not been prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate these deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="486">Tender</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase in which potential tenderers can draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documentation they have received begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and/or a call to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="488">By the date of opening of the envelopes, any tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to apply for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority shall comply with the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those provisions shall apply in particular to the organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Design offices that are involved in the management should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this phase of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, information may only be supplied to tenderers by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices responsible for drawing up the procurement documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During this whole phase, any contact between the design office and the applicants must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout the course, as allowing contact with them can adversely affect the competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">The e-mailed tenders must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with printing and circulating documentation, and their employees must be obliged to comply with confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with an indication of the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official responsible for their safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This worker must not be involved in any way in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">Received menus must be locked until the envelopes are opened.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the received offers are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall issue a report with details of the competition, including the number of the tender and information on the preparation of the tender and its receipt.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no specific regulations on the safekeeping of tenders.</seg>

<seg id="514">BRH checked the assignment of the administrative building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Sending tender documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The audited contracting authorities of the building administration sent out the tender documents either directly or commissioned an external company to print and distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="517">Self-employed persons did not send any documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information provided to tenderers</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the procurement documents relating to the questioning and obtaining of information, the contracting authority has not followed the rule on separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not include in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender notices even included the names of companies or self-employed persons who participated in the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, applicants who raised questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Marking offers</seg>
<seg id="524">For contracting entities, all accepted tenders have been stamped and received.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, tenders were accepted by self-employed professionals, thus violating the rule of one construction of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in the open bin of the mailroom to which all employees had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed a mailbox in the corridor without constant supervision, and part of the bids thrown into the mailbox remained there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to the staff.</seg>
<seg id="531">Sao</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not identify weaknesses in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">Rules are laid down in both countries to prevent contacts, in particular, between interested companies and design offices working together in the procurement procedure throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules for the prevention of manipulation and corruption are appropriate for receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, the collected control records showed infringements in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These irregularities can be easily corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of envelopes, the menus that have been closed so far are opened, their contents are read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period for which the tenderer is bound by his tender begins at the time of expiry of the period for the submission of envelopes or their opening and ends with a deadline specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national rights and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of "more eyes", transparency and credibility of the envelope opening process are intended to prevent manipulations and modifications of tenders already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">Compliance with the "multiple eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from secretly manipulating offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">Applicants may be present at the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="553">When opening, all envelopes must be put before the Chairman of the Commission and opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Late offers received must not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this phase, including conclusions(s), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, but are not limited to, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The enrollment must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The registration may also be signed by the candidates present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a commission is set up for the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts shall be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="561">The members of the Commission may also be entrusted with the task of discussing the subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. in the case of the commission. evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of a manager and a writer.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager shall be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of civil engineering, shall not be involved in the preparatory phase (production of tender documents), shall not decide on the award of the contract and shall not be members in the subsequent processing (procedure) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require that the envelope opening minutes contain not only bid prices, but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) signs, e.g. damaged envelopes when receiving or late in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the tender prices, the entry must include an indication of the language of the tender and the signature of the tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require that all parts of open envelopes be marked to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked in the form of perforation with a date, must be kept confidential (secret) after the end of the envelope opening and may only be made available to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no similar measures in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be informed without delay.</seg>
<seg id="571">In Germany, they do not have this adjustment and, if a single offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Main control findings</seg>

<seg id="574">The principle of cross-checking</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities adhered to the principle of four eyes.</seg>
<seg id="576">There were always managers and writers who were not assigned another role.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in rare cases, in small negotiated procedures, natural persons opened up tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="587">In the repair of the roads, for one event, the tenderer's tender was handed over to the contracting authority with a monthly delay, and it nevertheless accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">Essential parts of the provisions for opening envelopes are identical in both countries, taking into account the 'more eye' principle and the principle of transparency, thus making it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes in the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the workers responsible for opening envelopes shall not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">Despite the detection of some irregularities, the findings confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must review and evaluate tenders received within the time limit set.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, it must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law provides for a process of assessing and evaluating tenders in a few steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to check the suitability of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Applicants who have ever been convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Tenders of undeciced tenderers must be evaluated in terms of the correctness, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of the previously published procurement criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable tender and in particular examine all significantly low prices.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The outcome of the evaluation may be incorrectly influenced by the preference of a tenderer or its disadvantage, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take specific measures when selecting the persons included in the process and shall ensure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They must also make sure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the review and evaluation of tenders in successive steps.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for proving the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weights specified in the notice or in the tender documents shall not be amended.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria laid down for assessing the suitability of tenderers cannot be further applied.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view whether or not they are complete or not include suspicious elements which could encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of tenders submitted by them, they shall be informed without delay.</seg>
<seg id="617">Where, as a result of the evaluation of tenders, the quotation price is found to be disproportionately low, it must be given to the tenderer concerned the opportunity to comment on the situation before any withdrawal of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, tenderers must remain silent and only the beneficiaries can participate in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may examine the mathematical accuracy of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not included in the decision-making phase of the supplier's selection or the project implementation phase may be entrusted with the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating tenders, they must be aware that the offers are confidential and respect this fact.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals to the contracting authority for a decision.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by a commission appointed by the contracting authority, which draws up a report with a proposal for the conclusion of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">Where, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the applicant the opportunity to supplement the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the candidate does not prove them, they must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, it is necessary to examine not only the total price, but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">Where the price structure of the tender shows that the prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, tenderers must be asked for an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide explanations and if the contracting authority can demonstrate that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is intended to prevent tenderers from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to each part of the overall project, which can lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of the individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Valuation compensation is not the reason for excluding the offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer offering a disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10 % or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and the tenderers have not justified those prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is substantially higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not the reason for refusing to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike the German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">Where there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority shall immediately report this fact to the competent superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It must decide on the next procedure and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust office or law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">It must also approve (e.g. when the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the tenderer with the lowest bid), whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is discussed or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Fitness check and procurement criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of certain recommendations of potential suppliers made by self-employed persons, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, there was insufficient documentation as to whether the contracting authority had taken into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed persons or building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions which were to be held exclusively by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contracting authorities have tried to justify this fact by their lack of human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review the service offers of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of tenders and to carry out with due care the fulfilment of their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As regards contracting entities, as a rule, there was no evidence as to whether the offers in the custody of self-employed professionals were only available to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and mathematical check of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities have submitted open envelopes for further examination to self-employed experts without first carrying out the prescribed examination of tenders and a mathematical examination and without documenting the results of those examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention of manipulation, third parties may have made changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">The examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately identified or where price and product data were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A model inspection by one contracting authority revealed that in 75 % of the procurement procedures, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10 % from the pre-estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One of the 20 procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, there was no evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of tenders or negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was also also missing e.g. the unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or an increase in material costs were often cited as the reason for the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contracting authorities argued that identifying and proving compensatory prices was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting authorities, a 66 % lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">Data on closer examination of the cost or on the determination of the reasons for the deviations were not recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping on the tenderer to whom the contract would eventually be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority rated this tenderer as a 'low-cost company' which was unable to meet either the quality requirements or the deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the original cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the procurement procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that the tenderer could be presumed not to base its pricing on a disproportionately high cost.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">One contracting authority found two cases of irregularities, and these were reported to the company responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing an identical price calculation, which led the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The checks did not show any substantial deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">Sao</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction projects, such as the construction of a building site, the university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities have not excluded tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure, even if they have not complied with the requirements of the contracting authority referred to in the specifications, or have failed to provide the qualifications to the required extent, or, on the contrary, one contracting authority has failed to substantiate or explain the reason for the decommissioning of the candidate who complied with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Guest</seg>
<seg id="687">In the case of the construction of a waste water treatment plant, the individual evaluation criteria of the procurement procedure for the contractor were established, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For actions in the field of railway infrastructure development, the weighting of the award criteria at the start of the management was not determined at the start of the evaluation criteria, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the evaluation of the criterion of 'reduction of construction time' was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="690">For second and third place bidders, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in construction time than indicated in their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the candidate</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority has not demonstrated on the basis of which criteria it has assessed the tenders received and how it has selected the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">The correctness of the selection of small-scale procurement suppliers associated with the construction of a road circuit with an estimated price of up to CZK 500,000 is correct.</seg>
<seg id="694">Czk could not be verified because the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of performance, but documents on these negotiations were not produced.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for verifying and evaluating offers correspond to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ in view of the specific management steps and the selection of individuals involved in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike in the Czech Republic, these procurement process steps in Germany are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some cases, controls found that the substantial steps of the process in verifying and evaluating tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders makes it possible to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id="702">The checks have shown serious defects, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the screening and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against increased possibility of manipulation shall be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In checking the eligibility of prices, the German contracting authorities audited did not use a complete set of available instruments in all cases and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, weaknesses were found in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the use of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After review and evaluation of tenders, the procurement process shall be completed by the award of the contract or by the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its review, if appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The 10-day period applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract shall not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the decision of the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers shall be given the opportunity to have the fairness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by the prompt implementation of the procurement procedure decision.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority shall properly document the progress of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries implemented management information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly carried out examination and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is due to the fact that the tenderer is not bound by his tender after the expiry of that period.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning offer.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful tenderers should be informed of the result in a timely manner, stating the reason why their tender was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">The cancellation of a procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. by the commission of a contract procedure. if the prices in the tenders do not conform to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of the contract of 10 or 15 days applies to European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other proceedings in Germany, tenderers may not be informed of the award of the contract before deciding on its EU provisions and the award of a review.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only one tender has met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions laid down in the tender documents and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">Checks found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, European proceedings have received companies authorising letters before the notification period expires, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also, in several open cases, the authorising letters of modification incompatible with the content of the tender, e.g. in the form of a tender, were included in the form of an open procedure. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting entities have failed to meet the time limits for awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the tenderer offering a price of more than 50 % lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the originally offered price.</seg>
<seg id="740">Sao</seg>
<seg id="741">In one case, during the reconstruction and construction of the higher education institution, the contracting authority did not conclude a contract for the work with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the selected tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some road repair and maintenance events, the construction of a motorway and a road circuit, contracts were concluded later than required by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">For construction modifications in former military raids, the contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers only after the legal deadline had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of failed candidates contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act also includes the Institute of Legal Protection in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that a limited time limit for the conclusion of the contract had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such deficiencies in the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notification, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its individual stages, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">The data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental requirement of the principle of transparency applied at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">Appropriate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, since the obligation to justify individual decisions in detail and their merits significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Authority publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and the requirement of transparency is also fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the relevant information on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics to gain an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries fully transposed the provisions of the European Law on Documentation and Notification Obligations into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract does not only apply to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those which are compulsory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the 25,000 limit. € (625 ths. and direct proceedings exceeding the limit of CZK 15,000. € (375 ths. czk) incl. VAT.</seg>
<seg id="771">Only the parties are informed below this limit.</seg>
<seg id="772">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of assignments have not been fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notification did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. the reasons for supply specifications and national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain mandatory requirements.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="780">In the case of certain European procedures, the contracting authority made no errors in the publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of several assignments, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="782">Notification obligation</seg>
<seg id="783">Statistically tested files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Preliminary transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the contracting authority published information on the outcome of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one contracting authority, the contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the sponsor six months to notice the errors.</seg>
<seg id="788">Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not disclosed during that period.</seg>
<seg id="789">Sao</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant deficiencies were identified in the documentation on the conduct of the procurement procedure, such as the award procedure. incorrect information on bid prices in the protocols from the evaluation committee meetings.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some documents about opening envelopes have not been signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="794">In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, the construction of the motorway and the road circuit, the contract award notices were sent after the deadline or not published.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost the same in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.</seg>
<seg id="798">Czech notification obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.</seg>
<seg id="799">The checks revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel controls of the SAO and BRH were focused on two areas which are relevant to the procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation gives an opportunity for international competition within the EU with a view to creating a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures aimed at preventing corruption are not only intended to avoid or at least reduce corruption, but also to prevent financial damage and possible losses of confidence in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The findings of the two audit institutions – the SAO and the BRH – with regard to the application of the procurement law of the two countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of the common and distinct elements that can assist the two countries in further developing and applying that right.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries, there is thus an important common basis for public procurement and fulfilment of the essential requirements in the field of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting entities reinforce these requirements in part by very large-scale measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has applied provisions on public procurement requiring European management as well as to procedures that are below EU limits and is therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the checks have shown that contracting entities do not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the irregularities mentioned, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the controls identified risks affecting economy and achievement of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">This concerns, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the contract, which has resulted in additional works which have often been commissioned in breach of the law, the lack of definition of the intended price and the required qualification assumptions narrowing the possible range of tenderers and thus reducing competition, in particular in the field of transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint controls were not intended to detect cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">This was because both BRH and the SAO do not have the tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">When it comes to preventing corruption, the two countries have focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German provisions give scope for widespread and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">In particular, Czech regulations monitor the strengthening of the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles for the prevention of corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been incorporated between public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes very precisely, ways of complying with the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and for the selection of persons included therein.</seg>
<seg id="827">In THE BRH's view, the principle of the preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while reducing competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate control (in particular the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, procurement documents and various organisational measures are also an effective mechanism for preventing corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting entities should provide their staff with further training, thus familiaring them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant proportion of the weaknesses identified relate to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls in the delegation of powers increases the risk of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities prone to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">Sao</seg>
<seg id="837">Anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level in the Czech Republic, which also have a significant concern in the area of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO's control actions took place during the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely a significant change in the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The adopted strategy and the new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">For example, under the new rules, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the contract, the determination of the projected value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualification assumptions, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders and the proper substantiation and publication of everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion on the ways in which EU requirements are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their broad application in practice has confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for eu procurement.</seg>
<seg id="844">The transnational model introduced in the EU can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damages resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the obligation of the contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to practice in Germany, it has been apparent that the share of open procurement procedures should be increased in the Czech Republic, which give space to competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="848">The award of contracts in parts may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authorities. A higher number of applicants creates pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The provision of his organisation also affects the conduct of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany it is provided by special state organizations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and the BRH wish to further develop the knowledge in their work where appropriate and to address them with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of the procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for the guarantee that public contracts are awarded under a well-functioning and honest competition regime and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF PARALLEL CONTROLS ON EXCISE TAX ADMINISTRATION IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint final report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The present joint report informs about the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the management of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the supreme control institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO SR and the SAO CR in the performance of parallel controls aimed at the administration of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel controls was selected on the basis of the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to determine how it is applied at national level, how the system of excise tax administration is set up and how the systems are different in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest contribution of the control actions carried out was the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, the benefit was of finding that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty management is very limited without parallel controls being carried out.</seg>

<seg id="18">on the results of parallel checks of SPD administration in The Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic and their administration complies with EU law and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been identified between the adjustment of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, contributing to the effective administration of excise taxes by verifying the economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits and mandatory marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils and certain other oils; In The Czech Republic, the distribution of control marks is easier than in the Czech Republic and less burdens the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against leaks in excise duties, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials, the implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the register of sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol have proven to be good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Income from excise duties in the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing environmentally-friendly measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, among others. also because indexation of excise duty rates is not in place in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This results in a reduction in the importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden on excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="26">The state has long supported the implementation of environmental measures financially, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenues, which will thus need to be replaced by other revenue or a reduction in state expenditure in the future.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure incurred for the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic has been increasing for a long time, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is declining.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the Czech Technical University, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the electronization of excise duty management (IT expenditure) and expenditure on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The electronization of excise tax administration in the SR did not significantly affect the reduction in the number of tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO ČR and the SAO SR recommend that the FŘ SR reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditure was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period which would lead to a reduction in the personnel demands of the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrations was similar in the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Czech Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrations in the Czech Republic carry out administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical supervision of tax supervision, while tax administrations in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and more costly in relation to the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities.</seg>
<seg id="35">The electronization of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Czech Republic, the administration of tax returns on excise duties is fully electronized, in the Czech Republic documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronization support the effective management of excise duties, which is why the SAO CR and the SAO SR recommend that they apply them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure on the introduction of the EMCS system could not be compared as the FŘ SR provided data on expenditure only for the system upgrade in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was also spent before that period.</seg>
<seg id="39">The expenses incurred in that period only for the EMCS upgrade were about 20% higher in the SR than the expenditure incurred in the Czech Republic both for the introduction of EMCS and for the upgrade of this system in more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">The managers of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the SR, the management of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) made the management of excise duties more efficient, but in the SR to a lower extent, as significantly higher expenditure was incurred to implement the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation between the two audit institutions took place on the basis of the Cooperation Agreement in the implementation of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties of 18 December 2004. 8. 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO CR and the SAO SR have agreed to carry out parallel checks, which will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and whose results will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the facts found.</seg>
<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel controls were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the subject and objectives of parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The objective of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise managers, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise tax management process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit questions should have been answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did the managers of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duties (Excise Movement and Control System ( EMCS) made the management of excise duties more efficient and was the expenditure of its implementation spent efficiently?</seg>
<seg id="52">Parallel checks were to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration in the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic, especially in the area of regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.</seg>

It is therefore for the purposes of implementing the provisions of Directive 92/12/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of legislative changes for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the SR</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS system, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duty under the suspensive exemption regime has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where such services are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Under the EMCS electronic system, a suspension of access to EMCS was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office shall have the possibility to suspend access precisely on the justified concern of the undepayable or undetermined tax on previous tax years and its unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This concerns the maturity of the tax, since the transport of excise goods requires the composition of the collateral, which is released by the termination of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A major change in the management of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using the so-called 'mineral oil tax' was abolished. red diesel.</seg>
<seg id="244">The labeled gas oil, commonly called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel has been used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. for the use of the fuel. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue portion of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The abolition of red diesel was aimed at reducing the public deficit, simplifying the system of taxing mineral oils and reducing the administrative burden on the business entities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel dealer.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this statutory amendment was to introduce a record-keeping obligation for all petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The errification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely the fuel distributor and the fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This change has contributed to the elimination of tax evasion in petrol and diesel and has made the movement of these fuels more clear (see Annex 4, Scheme A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, the statutory provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">However, in the SR, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to label with an indication substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">In the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Material Act has been extended and a new tax entity – a tobacco trader – has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, the obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The check mark is cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the customer of the control marks must apply to the customs office for the issue of the inspection marks electronically, by means of an information system for the collection of the inspection marks.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnica Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system for printing control marks strengthens the system of checking goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the control mark, which can be used to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place shall be the checksum; 3. the place determines whether the code belongs to a control mark or a group of packages; 4. the place is the identifier of the series; 5.–8. space is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. instead of the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The control mark for the labelling of cigarettes shall also indicate the price of cigarettes, the stamp for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in the consumer pack and the length of the cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, because the original three substantive law regulations were repealed and a common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was drawn up mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of the taxation of alcoholic beverages, the solution of their production, the monitoring of movement, the security of tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the field, to streamline the performance of tax administration, to reduce the administrative burden for SMEs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of addressing the taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty to an alcoholic beverage and took into account the percentage of actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="273">For non-sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage of the actual alcoholic strength in the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is the exemption from excise duty for a natural person who produces a fizzy fermented drink for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household not more than 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution and use of control marks intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the customer of the control marks must apply to the customs office for the issue of the inspection marks electronically, by means of an information system for the collection of the inspection marks.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnica Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Scheme B) and the elimination of falsification of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system for printing control marks strengthens the system of checking goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the control mark, which can be used to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place shall be the checksum; 3. the place determines whether the code belongs to a control mark or a group of packages; 4. the place is the identifier of the series; 5.–8. space is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. instead of the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law No. 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">The fixed fuel tax, the tax on natural gas and some other gases and the electricity tax are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In contrast, in the SR, each excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the Excise Act on alcoholic beverages, which includes a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, from 1. 1. 2015, the issue of an authorisation for the handling of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act shall be subject to, inter alia, proof of the economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce tax collateral.</seg>
<seg id="292">FŘ SR carries out tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law provides that the production of control marks is carried out by the state company Mint Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic does not have the supervision of customs authorities in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken from the printer by the designated territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial site, the alcohol marking tapes are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturer of tobacco stickers and control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="298">In The Czech Republic there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or part thereof, in the Czech Republic such an obligation is not introduced.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco label bears an excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid at the time of collection of tobacco stickers at the authorized customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">On the other hand, the control mark does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced during the controlled period in case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, the so-called "mineral oil tax". green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this tax refund has also been extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In the SR, such support for farmers is not in place (it existed until 31 December 2004). 12. 2010 as the so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of EUR 20 million was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. czk (i.e. €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1 717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">In The Czech Technical University, a similar fuel distributor institute is established, but without the deposit required to secure the excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">In 2014, 303 distributors were registered in the Czech Germany and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the SR, an institute of the seller of fuels and the consumer of fuels is established, to which the local customs office issues authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="309">In the Czech Republic, such an institute is not established.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, the markings of selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to the abolition of the so-called mineral oils. red diesel, mineral oil labelling is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spiritity of the spirit drink, according to which the records of the control tapes are kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss, and return of the control tape are entered in the registry on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape is obliged to notify their use within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the SR, a control mark intended for the marking of alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax authorities and is used to verify the authenticity of the inspection mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register contains the number of stamps collected, used and claimed.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic have established a mandatory registration institute or the registration of a spirit distributor.</seg>
<seg id="317">In the SR, the registration is subject to the fulfilment of conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least €100 000 or paid-up capital of at least €100 000; minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is conditional, inter alia, on the deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In the SR, the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging requires the permanent presence of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, a special form of registration of a person obliged to mark alcohol is required for the production of alcohol in the Czech Republic, subject to the condition of depositing a deposit in favour of the tax administrator in the amount of CZK 100,000 (i.e. 3,700 €) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. 185,000 €) according to the amount of control tapes taken and the tracking device with continuous access by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic and the Czech Republic goes well beyond the EU minimum requirements for the subject and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as to risks identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax authorities to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, an excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials has been introduced in addition to EU legislation in the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw materials (e.g. leaves).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not a harmonised tobacco product, both the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic monitor their movement.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO CR and the SAO SR may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability for applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has proven itself because it reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such screening also under the conditions of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of control marks is more efficient in the Czech Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with the costs of transport between the printer and the customer of the control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Financial Administration of the Czech Technical System has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of the tax on tobacco products is more effective, because the tobacco label order itself is a tax return followed by payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">Thanks to the introduction of the institutes "fuel dealer" and "fuel consumer", the financial administration in the Czech Customs has a better overview of the places of sale of fuels.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of mandatory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or tax-exempt.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and in SR (2014) a new control tape was introduced, respectively, a mark containing an identification code.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the Czech Republic the new legislation has dropped its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">The impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol by a check mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO SR and the SAO CR may recommend the introduction of this control measure also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-client approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive because it introduces bail-burdening cash flow of tax entities, but it reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="342">Evolution of excise tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State in order to increase the revenue of the state budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to individuals and/or to society (regulatory function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Commission Communication: EUROPE 2020 – A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.12.2008, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. 3. 2010 under the resource-intensive Europe flagship initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, inter alia, in the context of the European Commission's decision to improve the use of instruments on the basis of market, inter alia, the european commission' energy taxation revision, with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from the workforce to, inter alia, energy and environmental taxation as part of the greater "greenness" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of tax revenues from excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic includes collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP is tracked, inter alia, by the percentage of excise duties in the total tax revenues. (i) the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both Supreme Audit Institutions used the following selection criteria to query the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP decreased slightly according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">For the conversion of amounts in CZK to € as at 31 December 2004, the amount of the amount in czk is to be converted into 12. the ecb's exchange rate was used in the relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 decreased by 9.1% year-on-year (from 25,140 to 27,425) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Bank Board of 7 December 2004. 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of excise collection, excise duty rates and per capita income in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off drop in excise tax revenues on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of old-priced tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also influenced by the increase in income tax collection, which has increased significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">The total collection of excise duties has the largest share of the excise duty on mineral oils (about 55.7% in 2015), but this has fallen despite the significant growth of the economy since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duties on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as anti-tax fraud measures in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible share is the gas tax, the fixed fuel tax and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the absence of a rate increase, their share will fall in the future in view of the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the reverberations of a large-scale case of tax fraud consisting in the placing in circulation of un taxed alcohol, 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such action and the recovery of the spirits market, the recovery of excise duty on alcohol exceeded 4 million in 2012. €.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of the tobacco tax has increased as a result of rising rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duty changed between 2012 and 2015 for tobacco tax, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tobacco tax, decreased significantly. For tobacco products, it rose only slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the excise rate is not set, so the functions of excise duties consisting in regulating socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the rise in living standards, real rates of excise duties are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity to inflation, this adjustment takes place on the basis of a law or contract (for pensions paid by the State is called valorisation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the SR</seg>
<seg id="371">The current legislative regulation of excise duties in the SR does not address the indexation of excise duty rates on the evolution of consumer prices because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="376">Of all the excise duties introduced in Slovakia, the excise duty on mineral oils has the largest share of the state budget's tax revenues, with its share not falling below 52% throughout the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">Excise duty on tobacco products accounts for the second largest share.</seg>
<seg id="378">This tax accounts for an average of approximately 32% of the total collection of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, the collection of excise duty per capita of the SR increased.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to an increase in excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The increase in collection of excise duties per capita of the SR is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention in relation to the exchange rate of the crown against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is approximately 2.7 times or 2.8 times higher in the Czech Republic, but per inhabitant of the Czech Republic the collection for these selected products is only about 1/3.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK against € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">The mineral oil tax also causes greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of a tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases has a significant impact.</seg>
<seg id="387">The evaluation of the real rate of excise duties in the Czech Republic decreased as a result of cnb interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic in total tax revenues does not increase and there is no shift away from labour taxation to the taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the value achieved by the share of excise duties is consistently above average compared to the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is mainly influenced by the change in excise duty rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future blackouts in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures subsidised by the State in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenue or by reducing state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="392">The absence of indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and the SR reduces their regulatory functions and is insufficiently supported by eu objectives based on a Europe less dependent on environmentally-friendly sources and in reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="393">Higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic shows higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the management of excise duties, i.e. the cost of the project. 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of the tax administrator in tax administration affects the scope and organization of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The determination of the efficiency of administrative costs of tax administration by the conversion factor is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in a line-driven structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out in addition to other activities by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organizational unit of the state and the entity.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration of the Slovak Republic is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, whereby the customs authorities are the internal organizational unit, the costs and revenues are included in aggregate for the whole organizational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise duties in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs, the expenditure and revenue of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative acts, which is carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial control tasks are carried out by other public authorities, but their significance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">In particular, the following departments carry out the administration of excise duties:</seg>
<seg id="406">Directorate-General for Customs</seg>
<seg id="407">Department 23 TAX</seg>
<seg id="408">Department 231 – Tax methodologies monitor and propose legislative measures, ensure the interpretation of legislation, methodically manage and coordinate: the implementation of tax administration and related regulatory agendas, in particular tax management and related control and supervision activities, administration of the transport of selected products;</seg>
<seg id="409">Department 232 – ELO and search performs searches and methodically controls the transport controls of selected products and ensures international cooperation between ELO and EMCS;</seg>

<seg id="435">The creation of the FŘ SR was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In connection with the performance of the administration of excise duties, activities related to the management of excise duties within the organisational structure of the FŘ SR were incorporated into a number of different sections and related departments.</seg>

<seg id="444">excise agents – review the decisions of the customs authorities on the basis of ordinary and extraordinary remedies applied; appeal procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="445">The customs section was established in the course of 2012; under it were directly incorporated individual customs offices (9 customs offices) which have territorial competences designated by higher territorial units, with the exception of one customs office, which was established inter alia. to carry out tasks relating to the external border of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">excise department — carrying out methodological activities in relation to customs offices and customs offices; in the case of selected entities, the tax administrator performs direct acts, namely the registration (tax warehouse, authorized recipient of the repeated, registered sender), the amount of the tax security, determines and refunds the tax, exercises tax supervision and tax control; decides on the waiver of the composition of the security tax; decides to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of an employee of the customs office in the alcohol tax warehouse;</seg>

<seg id="451">SR's financial administration expenditure on the management of excise duties is steadily increasing, as, with the exception of wage growth, investments for efficient tax administration and the electronisation of financial administration are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although excise revenues increased, spending grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the administration of excise duties increased more significantly between 2012 and 2015, this growth was mainly due to the increase in wage and technical support expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties also grew at approximately the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the wider competences of the customs administration compared to the Czech Republic, e.g. weighing of trucks, control of compliance with obligations in connection with the toll.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in the SR shows a slightly deteriorating trend year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but the expenditure per employee increased.</seg>
<seg id="459">Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee increased more slowly compared to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, wage growth is a significant factor in the deterioration of the efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be evaluated as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining significant administrative burdens in the management of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, which is confirmed by the non-decreasing number of employees in the field of excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="463">In The Czech Technical League, however, the management of excise duties at lower incomes is significantly more demanding on personnel capacities.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators for the administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="465">Excise management is a set of activities that aim to correctly identify, determine, and secure the payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the management of excise duties are the assessment of taxes, authorisation and registration for activities, supervision of transport, control and search of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The number of administrative tasks and managed entities are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the monitored indicator and the number of tax authorities expresses the effectiveness of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisation and registration are a prerequisite for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under the suspensive exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to carry out continuous administration with the authorisation or registration entities with a focus on supervising compliance with the legislation and conditions laid down by the tax administrator, for which adequate personnel resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The monitored indicator was the number of valid authorisations or registrations to operate as at 31 December 2004. 1.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of authorisations or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the case.</seg>
<seg id="474">The administrative tasks pursued are the frequency of the most important acts of the tax administrator (tax claim, administration of transport in EMCS), or activities which are a sequence of acts terminated by a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Authorisation and registration to operate in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">You can produce, process, store, receive, or ship selected products by permission of the tax administrator to run the tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the tax warehouse operator has more than one warehouse, a permit shall be issued for each separately, including tax security.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. the physical presence of the official and the provision of equipment by the conclusion of the tax administrator).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">The operator of the tax warehouse also registers for tax pursuant to Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">An authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products conditionally exempt from the place of importation to the tax warehouse, to the authorised consignee in another Member State, to the place of export in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replaces the status of registered consignor in accordance with Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels tax-free, which are analogous to the authorisation of a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="485">The distillery produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (CZK 14,300/hl ethanol) – fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the permit to operate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower intended for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The records of the distillation produced by the operators of the distillery and made available to the tax authorities shall contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">The beneficiary for the re-reception of the selected products and the beneficiary for the single admission of the selected products shall be entitled, on a one-off basis, to accept or re-receive the selected products in a conditional system transported from another Member State on a one-off basis.</seg>
<seg id="489">The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or ship the selected products under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of selected exempt products is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or pursuant to § 52a or § 53 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll. sells to another user selected exempt products; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">The exempted products selected may be accepted and used only on the basis of a final authorisation, and only from the supplier specified in the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of an authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of the authorisation or to a user who is authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Mineral oils exempt ed may be sold without authorisation in statutory cases, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if the user has produced or originated in his or her activities,</seg>

<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent before the start of transport to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="503">The service station operator owns fuel sold at the service station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Gas stations are places where, on the basis of the permission of the building authority, the sale or dispensing of PHM is usually allowed into the fuel tank.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade registers service stations and their operators broken down into: registered – normal sale or issue of PHM, as a rule, in the fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined approach – operation usually in various business premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, farms, transport organizations, building yards), the sale is carried out here limited to the other party on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public – fuel dispensing points only for the operators' own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="506">The pumping station is not a construction or equipment in the form of an operating tank placed in operation (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is issued only for its own use.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to the tax authorities' permission and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases placed for free circulation for resale by natural and legal persons under the authorisation of the tax administrator.</seg>

<seg id="514">Tax control is carried out within the period for determining the tax, which is three years, the period being extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, initiating criminal proceedings in connection with the tax in question), or being opposed (judicial proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The time limit for determining the tax shall end no later than the expiry of 10 years from the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">The tax authorities are not obliged to carry out a tax audit on each tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">The start of the tax audit puts up time limits for the possibility of submitting an additional tax return or additional billing by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the period for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">On the basis of its outcome, the ex officio tax may be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-bound action (one day) in which the tax administrator searches for evidence and conducts examinations of premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packages for tax entities and other persons involved in tax administration, on the spot outside the premises of the tax administrator (e.g. at the tax entity, at the point of sale, on the road during transport).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and belongings, take samples or arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="521">Based on the outcome of the local investigation, the tax cannot be individually adjusted, but the tax entity can be asked to file an additional tax return (Section 145(2) of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">The control of transport data in the EMCS is not a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="523">The order of the alcohol marking checklists may only be placed by the registered person obliged to mark the alcohol to the tax authorities and is made by means of smart forms, which are automatically imported into the application of the spirit label register.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered quantity of check strips, and orders production.</seg>
<seg id="525">He does not supervise the production of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">Production is provided by the State Printing House of Valuables, a state-owned enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">The customer of the control tapes takes control tapes from the tax administrator at the local place of the marking point.</seg>
<seg id="528">Ordering tobacco stickers to label cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and tobacco for smoking acts as a tax return.</seg>

<seg id="539">Performance indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="540">Authorisation and registration to operate in the Czech Air Court</seg>
<seg id="541">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Technical Association is mainly provided by the customs authorities and the Department of Excise Duties of the Customs and Tax Section of the Czech Technical Office, whose procedure in the administration of excise duties is regulated by the individual excise laws and the tax code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws provide not only the scope of authorisation for the CÚ and the FÚ SR in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, due to an increase in issued permits within tax warehouses, an increase in the registrations of the beneficiary authorised for the re-recruitment and registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification obligation if they are transported freely or in packages with a content of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to control and transport procedure to include other goods, e.g. mineral oils. o anti-tapping agents, oxidising inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, viscosity improvement products, anti-corrosion agents.</seg>
<seg id="545">A mandatory indication has been introduced for lubricating oils concerning the indication of their kinematic viscosity.</seg>
<seg id="546">The approach of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Technical University is set out in the following sections of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Within the framework of national legislation of the Slovak System, when registering the tax warehouse operator in the framework of all excise articles, a person who wants to operate a tax warehouse must also apply at the same time for registration and the issue of a permit for the operation of a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, by which the tax warehouse operator obtains legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CA shall issue an authorisation to operate a tax warehouse which entitles the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="551">In the event that the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax administrator issues a separate permit for each tax warehouse to operate the tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The transport of the subject of excise duty under the conditional exemption scheme is monitored electronically through the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, called a reference code.</seg>
<seg id="554">ARC code under which the said transport can be tracked online and thus in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the tax warehouse operator is also the person authorised to distribute alcohol, he shall notify the VAT electronically the trade name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer alcohol packaging and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging it enters into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">The registered consignor is a special type of tax entity which cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if it sends the subject of excise duty under the conditional exemption procedure after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under the national legislation of the Slovak System, when registering a registered consignor in the context of all excise articles, a person who wishes to send the subject of excise duty under the conditional exemption procedure after his placing under the customs procedure 'free circulation', must also apply to the CA for the registration and issue of an authorisation to send the subject of excise duty under that procedure.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CA shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and shall also issue an authorisation to send the subject-matter of excise duty under the suspensive procedure after its entry under the customs procedure 'free circulation'.</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing distillery</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of the distillery is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the ministry's own authorisation does not entitle the holder of the permit to operate the distillery.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order for a person to operate a distillery, a person must submit an application to the CA for registration and the issue of a registration certificate for the planting distillery operator.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CA shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which at the same time entitles the operator of the distillery to produce alcohol in the distillery.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of the distillery is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Grower distillery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislature allows for an application of a reduced tax rate of 50 % of the basic rate of tax, i.e. 50 % of the basic rate of tax, to alcohol produced in a distillery. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced rate of tax shall apply to alcohol produced in a distillery in a quantity not exceeding 43 l a. per grower and his household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period shall be as from 1 January 2005. 7. current year to 30 June 2006 6th of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore it is possible to apply a reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced several times within a single calendar year because the alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">It involves the production of alcohol outside the suspensive exemption scheme, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays not only excise duty and value added tax for the distillery produced, but also the price for the services rendered.</seg>
<seg id="573">The distillery shall issue the grower a pick-up certificate, which serves not only as proof of the origin and method of acquisition of alcohol, but also of payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of the alcohol thus produced shall not be subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of consumer packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third State and to place it in free tax circulation in the tax territory, to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of consumer packaging does not register with the relevant excise duty, but the CA shall issue it with a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate authorises importers to import consumer packaging of alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the control marks, they must lodge a tax guarantee at the rate of the amount of tax attributable to the quantity of alcohol or cigarettes which it wishes to put into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="580">Importers of consumer packaging must enter into free tax circulation only consumer packages marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, they must submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the inspection marks exported to the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer shall have the number of stamps imported back from the territory of a third State at the customs office of importation.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds within the meaning of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also included in the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the event of the release of consumer packaging for free circulation, the compound tax guarantee shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax stock.</seg>
<seg id="586">Where the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol is also a person authorised to distribute alcohol, it shall notify the VAT electronically the trade name of the consumer alcohol packaging, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer alcohol packaging and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging it enters into free circulation, no later than the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>

<seg id="603">Fuel dealer</seg>
<seg id="604">A new type of tax entity, namely the fuel dealer, has been introduced to monitor fuels in free circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation governing service stations in the territory of the SR.</seg>

<seg id="614">It is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of propellents e.g. invoice, which also contains the fuel distributor number allocated by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax administrator in the territory of the SR records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="616">Above all, this is an effort to avoid roadside checks during transport, which is why carriers use side roads, bypassing the toll collection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual transports.</seg>
<seg id="617">Transports of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tanks are also carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times it happens that illegal transport accompanies the vehicle, which carriers report possible mobile patrols in order to change the route and avoid roadside inspection.</seg>
<seg id="619">The fuels are also mixed with light heating oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel distributor</seg>

<seg id="627">That document shall contain, in addition to the quantities, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As they are fuels in free circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of such goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">It is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of propellents e.g. invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor or registered person assigned by the tax administrator.</seg>

<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family businesses, which also run restaurants or pubs, in which they offer for sale beer of their own production.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative tasks in The Czech</seg>
<seg id="652">This subchapter approximates the exercise of the tax supervision of the administration of excise duties on selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Technical Party.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3 %) between 2012 and 2013, which resulted in more EMCS services.</seg>
<seg id="654">By contrast, the largest decrease was recorded year-on-year in 2014, by up to 4.3%, due to fewer completed tax checks and fewer tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="655">This decrease concerned legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax controls</seg>
<seg id="657">By exercising tax control, the CA determines or examines the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">In carrying out tax control, the employees of the CA shall be shown by the mandate to carry out tax control, which includes, inter alia, the purpose and subject-matter of the control and the scope of the tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the tax year audited can be one month, but also more tax periods.</seg>

<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol</seg>
<seg id="679">By the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 January 2005, the Slovak Republic has been a member of the European Union. 5. 2004, there was also a change in the area of excise tax management.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of the state budget in the management of alcohol excise duty, improved the business environment in the area and the introduction of legislative instruments to more effectively suppress the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption in 2004 of new laws in relation to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the field of the management of excise duties from the tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the presence of the tax administrator in the tax warehouse on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of the Slovak Republic, the national legislation exhaustively defines that it is possible to receive, issue, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse only in the presence of an employee of the CA.</seg>
<seg id="683">These shall not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches alcohol only in consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CA is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse so that the income, supply, production or processing of alcohol is not limited.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator is obliged to ensure the conditions of the working environment for the employees of the CA.</seg>
<seg id="686">On the basis of a contract concluded with FŘ SR for the premises provided on a monthly basis, the CA pays the operator of the tax warehouse the cost of the lease.</seg>
<seg id="687">In the tax warehouse during the manufacture, processing or storage of alcohol, the production installation for the storage of alcohol must be adapted in such a way that the quantity of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0000 000 0</seg>
<seg id="688">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">If alcohol is not accepted, issued, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of an employee of the customs office, and is obliged to secure this area by closing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this option is not used very often because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators make use of the legal option within the meaning of Act No. 467/2002 Z. z., on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use production facilities for the production of spirits in the distillery for growing burning and also for the purposes of distillate distillate distilleries, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>

<seg id="724">Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new information system for control marks.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new stamp information system was to simplify and inform the system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution and use of control marks intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>

<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is applied to tax warehouses for alcohol, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision of the tax administrator through a tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are a tax warehouse, in the Czech Republic they are only registered by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="755">In The Czech Republic there is an institute of registered sender, which is included in the Tax Warehouse in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In the SR, it is possible to burn 43 l a with a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in the case of cultivation burning.</seg>
<seg id="757">On the other hand, in the Czech Republic, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can only be applied to 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">The distillery in the Czech Republic must be authorised not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Czech Republic, but also from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture permits the distillery.</seg>
<seg id="760">In The Czech National Court, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is carried out in addition to the tax warehouse operator by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The authorisation of the importer shall be subject to registration by the applicant with the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax administrator is required to import consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In SR, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is subject to the issue of a tax administrator's permit for sellers.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a legal obligation to keep records, inter alia, of the product concerned. purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the final seller of consumer packaging of alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the trade authority; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In SR, the seller of the fuel must have permission from the tax administrator to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">The national legislation in the Slovak Technical Union does not regulate any special regulation of the pumping station, all activities related to filling stations are regulated only in the Law on excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special fuel law, but the tax administrator does not issue any permits for the sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In SR, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">Since 2012, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities in the Czech Technical Region.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="775">In the Czech Technical Court, substantive legislation provides for the obligation to exercise tax control for selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified by the internal management act issued by the FŘ SR due to the application of a single procedure of tax administrations in the territory of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, the substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to carry out tax control, the procedural law provides only for the possibility of carrying out an inspection no later than the time limit for the assessment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR determines in which cases and within what time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax audit, whereas in the Czech Republic the correctness of the amount of excise duty granted or its refund is verified mainly by local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to an increase in the number of services in the EMCS system and at the same time as a result of an increase in the number of tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the SR, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of transports in the EMCS system and at the same time the decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">There were differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrations was similar in the Czech Republic in the individual years of the period audited.</seg>
<seg id="784">In the Czech Republic, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is approximately two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same number of administrative tasks.</seg>
<seg id="785">It can be stated from this that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative tasks to the tax authorities, e.g. the tax authorities. physical tax surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote supervision, e.g. in the czech republic. tracking device, the immediate sending of data via the web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronization of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">The tax return can be filed via the data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced a so-called interactive tax return forms, which can no longer be processed in an automated manner.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must also be rewritten into the personal tax account of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is to limit the error rate of filed tax returns (DAP), which savings the tax administrator's actions related to the repair procedure erroneously filed by DAP.</seg>
<seg id="793">DGC is working on a new dap electronic processing application.</seg>
<seg id="794">Furthermore, by means of smart forms: to submit tax applications or registrations for activity and to notify of changes in data, to make refunds, to fulfil notification obligations in the treatment of special mineral oils, to the management of raw tobacco and to fulfil biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available to registered entities for registration by the tax administrator of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products around the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption procedure must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">The transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, decision of the customs office on the placing of the selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or any other decision on the assessment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is determined by law.</seg>
<seg id="799">To facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Section 5 and Section 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to the data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">The JIK serves for the purposes of customs control on the way and prevents repeated transport on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of the tax fuel warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, CS ČR has online access to an electronic registration system into which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS Cr is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. electronic system for the registration and monitoring of the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should benefit from 70 % of the existing EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-known environment for declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be linked to the global guarantee system, to the tax entity register or to the risk analysis system.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and the sharing of the negotiating numbers by means of simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current process of recording the transport of selected products in free circulation can be seen mainly in the misuse of a simplified accompanying document, the re-use of a single document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronization of administrative tasks in SR</seg>
<seg id="810">In the administration of excise duties, the Financial Administration of the SR uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the conditional exemption regime, stamp marks, the filing of tax returns, as well as the registration and registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, one-way electronic communication between tax entities with the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">In the context of electronic communication, the tax entity has a personal internet zone, the so-called "internet zone", made available after entering the access data. electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with financial management.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the tax entity has access to the electronic mail room through which it submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are primarily value added tax payers, tax advisors representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">The SAO SR also addressed the issue of the extent of electronisation of excise tax administration during the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communications within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">If the transports carried out in the EMCS system are taken away, there has been an increase in the electronisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">Fully electronized processing of the tax return is already in place in the Czech Court, from its filing to the registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax return is not set up.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities is set up to insert mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation on the website.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation in the form and basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting services in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which, contrary to the legislation, excise duty has not been paid.</seg>
<seg id="828">These can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Because of good practice in the Czech Republic in the field of electronization of tax returns, the SAO SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend to complete the electronization of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organizational structure and personnel security in the field of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic have undergone major changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">Customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 consists of the Directorate-General of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and departments of the State.</seg>
<seg id="835">DGC is an entity for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">Since 2004, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out a comprehensive administration of excise duties as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS CR also performs:</seg>
<seg id="838">(a) control:</seg>
<seg id="839">In the field of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of charges for the use of roads, fulfilment of conditions for the carriage of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of crews of vehicles in international road freight transport and in matters of international transport of persons),</seg>
<seg id="840">The management of waste and packaging material,</seg>
<seg id="841">The safety of imported food,</seg>
<seg id="842">in the field of consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">The employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">b) customs administration – it is a comprehensive application of customs legislation, commercial policy measures and formalities in the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">(c) the collection and recovery of pecuniary transactions imposed by other public authorities within the framework of a divided administration;</seg>
<seg id="846">d) the activities of the police authority (authorized customs authorities) in the proceedings on crimes committed by customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the scope of competences (the confluence of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are cost savings from the scope, since the public administration does not have to spend on the status of the control group for each subject of the inspection separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden on the persons inspected is reduced by repeated checks.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also carries out, from 1 January 2005, the customs authorities of the Czech Republic on the implementation of the 12. 2016 scope for the examination of the fulfilment of obligations in the registration of sales (Section 2(2) of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the registration of sales) and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and the conditions of the operation of gambling, including the imposition of penalties (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">As part of the project Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has changed with effect from 1 January 2009. 1. 2013 a three-stage structure on a two-stage basis, with the abolition of the central article of the procedure (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">DGC spent around EUR 51 million on the project. (i.e. about €2,031,000).</seg>
<seg id="852">CS CR from 1. 1. 2013 consists of DGC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and departments of the State.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competences provided by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial workplaces are internal organizational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to establish and abolish the territorial workplace and to determine their substantive scope.</seg>
<seg id="856">The legislation does not provide for any competences for the territorial workplace; the competences of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure until 31 December 2005 12. 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure from 1. 1. 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Administration of excise duties until 31 December 2005 12. 2012, DGC, eight CCs and 58 departments of the CA (including branches), i.e. 67 trade unions and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1 January 2004, the 1. 2016, dgc's excise duty management and 51 departments were carried out at the CA and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight departments of the DGC Legal Department and the CÚ's mobile supervision departments, i.e. the dgc departments. approx. 60 seats.</seg>
<seg id="861">Cs Cr costs most significantly affect wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there was no savings in personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is carried out by customs officers in the service under the Law on the service of members of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the number of these officers is very limited in the Czech Republic, since according to the provisions of § 42 para. 1 of Act No. 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, may be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">The reduction of posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to provide the staff with the assignment of appropriate posts within the Corps, or to provide posts with another security body (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will be transferred to a reserve for the temporarily unclassified, in which members of the security forces belong according to the law 80 % of the average service income.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organisation of excise tax administration in The Czech Technical Society</seg>
<seg id="868">In the framework of the 2012-2016 programme statement, the Government of the Slovak Republic has identified as one of the priorities the completion of tax administration reform through the UNITAS programme, which will provide additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, customs duties and levies and the suppression of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, tax reform was implemented at the central level, which brought about the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Czech National System of the Czech National System and the Customs Directorate of the Czech National System into the Financial Directorate of the Czech System of The Czech System and the creation of financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">The SR F.C. was established on 1 January 2004. 1. 2012 by Act No. 333/2011 Z. z., on state administration bodies in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation, which has its seat in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">FŘ SR, CÚ and the Criminal Office of The Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No. 199/2004 Z. z., the Customs Act and on the amendment and addition of certain laws, as amended, are the customs authorities if they perform tasks under customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Act No. 333/2011 Z. z., on state administration bodies in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities form the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as at 1 January 2005 is not the case. As of 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Czech Technical Party, the Criminal Office of the Tax Administration, the Competence Centre for Financial Operations, the Tax Office for Selected Tax Entities, the branches of the tax offices, the contact points of the tax offices, the offices of the customs authorities (branch of the Tax Office, the Combined Ca branch, the branch of the Customs Office) and the customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of the FŘ SR is to collect and manage taxes and customs duties efficiently, i.e. to collect taxes and customs duties. consumption taxes, to meet the revenue portion of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The President of the Financial Administration is responsible for the activities of the entire financial administration and, therefore, for the activities of the FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organizational structure of the SR FŘ from 1. 1. 2012 in abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">Within all customs offices in the territory of the SR, activities and processes in the field of excise tax management also provide departments of excise duties (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments) in addition to branches of customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations).</seg>

<seg id="883">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">In 2015, in addition to the FŘ SR, 74 organisational departments with a total of 1,300 employees were engaged in the organisational structure of the financial administration of the Czech Technical University in 2015; these services are managed by almost 48 000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">In 2015, approximately 60 organizational departments with a total of 1,011 employees, which manage approximately 114,000 tax entities, were engaged in the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual excise tax administration activities is divided among several staffed independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their coordination and cooperation is solved through medium and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the Czech Technical Party, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise tax administration is divided between the department of excise duties and the branch of the customs office, in which the same employees of the tax administrator often deal with this agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In The Czech Republic, approximately one-third of the number of tax entities per total number of employees in the field of excise tax administration compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the impact of a higher number of employees on the efficiency of the administration of excise duties is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="893">Pursuant to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2003 on the protection of the european communities's products[2', the Commission has decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC In order to ensure that the transport of goods is carried out in the context of the use of the goods in the community, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on the transport of the products to be obtained and the prescribed checks carried out, to simplify the movement of goods within the Community under the excise duty suspension procedure.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of that Decision allows the inclusion of national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such technical or software equipment as the Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">EMCS Development and Functionality</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by the System of Registering Selected Products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS is fully operational in the Czech Republic from 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">In the Czech Republic, the so-called customs module and declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">In addition to the Community system, shipments under the conditional exemption regime initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic are monitored in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system shall ensure, after approval of the notification of receipt of the consignment intended for the authorised consignee for the one-time acceptance of the automatic sending of the information to the register of tax entities, followed by the invalidation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures the administration of received and submitted requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including the sending of responses with an attachment in any format and ensuring translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a report on manual cessation of exports in the ECS (only the referral of an automatically created message is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS system will not allow the approval of e-AD or notification of receipt without the reaction of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available to tax entities free of charge, it takes the form of a web application into which the user logs in with a username and password (coordinates) assigned to him after registration with CS CR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Any action against the EMCS customs module shall bear a valid electronic signature in the declarant module of the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="910">The declarant module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and completed services under the suspensive exemption scheme, so that tax entities do not have to spend funds to acquire the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module allow you to retrieve and store data offline (saves time on frequently used data), fill in recipient data based on seed ID checks and require mandatory filling of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for the payment of each shipment sent from the Czech Republic in real time to block the provision of excise duty in the appropriate amount of taxable supplies until the end of transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient collateral, the EMCS declarant module is not allowed to submit the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and includes arc transport (including the above blocked lock) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight contracts with performance from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. €1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">In the audited period, expenses of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438.99) were spent on the EMCS upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the upgrade of the EMCS in the audited period and converted into one transport entered into the EMCS is on average CZK 16.49 (i.e. €0.62), excluding national transport, the expenditure in the amount of one transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States is CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92).</seg>
<seg id="922">EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four contracts with performance from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. €281,389.77) was invoiced, including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport entered into the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">The development invoices and technical support related to the national solution and the development of the EVV application, which was already operated by DGC prior to the EMCS system itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">Invoices were paid under programme funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services to other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in SR</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under the suspensive procedure.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document – SAD, which was used before the effectiveness of this system, thus ensuring better control and management of transport.</seg>
<seg id="931">In SR is introduced from 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented with requirements under EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, called a reference code.</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which it is possible to monitor the traffic online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">EMCS Development and Functionality</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS system ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by tax entities authorised to use the EMCS system, thus greatly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The greatest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when the EMCS system was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of the EMCS system was implemented as an additional module of sysned application equipment and therefore it is not possible to determine precisely on the Slovak side the amount of the cost of its initial application.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of the EMCS was to replace the system based on the administration of transport in paper form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefits of the EMCS system are a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU from notification of the start of transport to its completion – a reduction in administrative costs for tax authorities and tax entities for the processing, transmission and archiving of documents is important.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, a national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two points in the Czech Republic or in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and provision of a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">A national functionality is also established, which monitors the riskiness of the tax entity or transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="946">The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of transports within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, the expenditure incurred in the SR to upgrade this system was €744,310.01 higher between 2012 and 2015 than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO SR obtained data on the emcs upgrade from the FŘ only for the period from 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Nevertheless, the expenses incurred to upgrade the EMCS system in the SR were €188,134.44 higher than the cost of introducing and upgrading the EMCS system in about ten years of operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">For the controlled period, the amount of expenses related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in the SR in the amount of one transport exceeds 2.3 times the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO CR and the SAO SR met the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both control institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and The Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel checks, examples of good practice have been identified that could contribute to reducing tax fraud, and their importance will increase with rising tax rates.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures to reduce the cost of excise duty management have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons unless coordinated due diligence is carried out with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The 1977 Lima Declaration stresses that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration calls for tax receipts to be checked to the fullest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers tax to be one of the most important components of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The EUROSAI VI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenues carried out by the SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">A specific strategy for the audit of public revenues is an important step towards optimising the control activities of the SAI.</seg>
<seg id="8">This concerns, in particular, taxes as the most large source of public revenue, which is most prone to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies are increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may, to some extent, be unable to carry out control activities without cooperation with another State's SAI.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the income of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat this crime, responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAIs carrying out checks in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just on VI. The eurosai congress in Bonn was the idea of carrying out a review of the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") and the VIES system in the framework of cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Careful preparation followed, with both parties first having to familiarize themselves with the legal environment and procedures for vat management in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of an analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was carried out which was included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving effective and efficient VAT governance is a long-term problem, and individual states (in particular the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of vat more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our inspection can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for the proposal to improve the system of international information exchange.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel value added tax management checks carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Check number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Administration of value added tax after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Verification of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the control action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of financial authorities in the administration of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "the EU") linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to value added tax exemption for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the inspection was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the abovementioned Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">The System for the Exchange of Information on Value Added Tax Control Actions was carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic ('the SAO') and the German Bundesrechnungshof ('BRH') in cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two supervisory institutions on 8 December 2004. They shall forthwith inform the</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected commercial transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Czech Republic") and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of vat management systems between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period audited was from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005. 5. 2004 to 31 December 2004 12. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel control in the field of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAI.</seg>
<seg id="34">Outside the main point – the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – the control covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and summary reports, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the control included the legal situation in the field of international bus passenger transport and the comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">By comparing the VAT management systems of the two countries, there were differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is the exceeding of the limit set out in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is assigned to the payers, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, the payers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called 'intra-Community transaction'. VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus passenger transport is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic payers only submit VAT returns for a single tax year (month or quarter), in Germany, the payers are obliged to submit so-called vat returns. provisional VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike czech payers, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic, payers report to the tax offices, in Germany, the payers submit summary reports to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="53">Therefore, the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have data from summary reports available immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">German tax authorities have information from summary reports available only after their processing at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires that updated information on intra-Community transactions be available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Monthly recapitulative reports would reduce the time shift between the date of the transaction and the update of data in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would subsequently allow for a timely examination of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">Which would, however, require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of VAT information.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CUSTOMS monitors compliance with the three-month period for requests for information received.</seg>
<seg id="61">German CLO does not track the elapsed time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent alert (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">(6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States develops its own risk management system, hereinafter referred to as "RMS", which has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, both SAI examined selected cases of intra-community transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions in which there were doubts as to their implementation or suspected VAT evasion were examined using the clo legislation.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained in the form of international cooperation and gave the payers vat liability.</seg>
<seg id="72">In such cases, the payers either wrongly claimed the exemption of supplies from VAT or did not admit the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of the different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax authorities of another Member State refused to reply to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases have been identified where payers have misreported business transactions in summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in VIES were incorrect and the tax authorities had to investigate these cases (see 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">Control action progress</seg>

In the Czech Republic, it is no longer possible for the "unsauched" payer to cancel the VAT registration in a given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§ § 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as "AO"), anyone who carries out business activities is obliged to inform the municipal/municipal authority or the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the municipal/municipal tax office.</seg>

<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-residents in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (hereinafter referred to as "UStG").</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the amount of turnover they make.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax offices for entrepreneurs permanently living abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those based in the Czech Republic, the relevant Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office is the competent.</seg>
<seg id="167">As at 30 June 2004, the On 15 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; as at 1 January 2004, the A total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered on March 1, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="168">THE BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register the so-called "tax authorities". independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">As work permits from 10 new EU Member States are limited after they have joined the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Paragraph 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single employer, which determines their working hours and the way in which they perform their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent tax authority in which he must provide information on the company and the activities it carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by general focus departments responsible for assessing taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form shall assess the risk of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax authority, the next three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the other five (or four) are to distinguish the payers, the last being always the check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he or she needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an intra-Community tax-exempt delivery.</seg>
<seg id="178">THE CLO assigns a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a vat number.</seg>
<seg id="179">THE CLO assigns vat ids to entrepreneurs automatically when they indicate an intra-Community delivery in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of the entrepreneur may be cancelled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business), after carrying out all administrative work (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration becomes aware that it no longer engages in business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the CUSTOMS of the abolition of the tax number in order to allow the CUSTOMS to terminate the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (Section 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in the case of 1. whereas turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2 July 1999; not be more likely to exceed EUR 50 000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs vat and are not entitled to an input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and have to file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur may declare that the provisions of § 19 para. 1 UStG apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration shall be binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For tax non-residents, there is the possibility to appoint tax representatives (Section 22a of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is necessary to ensure that they carry out exclusively exempt commercial operations and are not entitled to an input tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of the tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>

<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is the exceeding of the limit set out in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the set limit, it has the possibility to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration process is standardized in Germany, but there may be differences due to different organizational models in federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same VAT registration number for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the payer is assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must request the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called 'intra-Community transaction'. VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH have discovered, germany's two-step registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, a two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax authority about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT obligation.</seg>
<seg id="206">Because different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as a VAT number).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will allocate vat registration number at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This VAT number will be valid for the life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the competent tax authority shall request an economic VAT number, which will be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the introduction of an IT resource to manage the VAT registration number has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus passenger transport</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., it is valid from 1. 5. 2004 the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct.</seg>
<seg id="216">Such transport shall be exempt from VAT, even if it is carried out by entrepreneurs who are registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">Return transport is considered to be a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If "unsettled" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out any other economic activity in addition to international bus transport of persons, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International transport of persons in the Czech Republic was exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V to Chapter 10. Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No Article 1(1)(b) (b) which states:</seg>
<seg id="220">'For the purposes of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 28(2) And regulation (EC) No 125 Article 3(b) of The Basic Regulation, the commission shall Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt value added tax on international passenger transport referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 10 of Directive 2001/12/EC has been fulfilled. 28(2) And regulation (EC) No 125 Article 4 of the Directive or for as long as the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier.'</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 June 2006 on the approximation of the community for the purposes of the european union's free movement of such data [2], it is appropriate to take into 2006, implemented under Section 3b(1)(a) of the Treaty on European Union. 1 of the German VAT Act is the place of provision of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) route (i.e. the place where the transport takes place).</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only that part of the route that takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable provision of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident tax resident transports passengers via Germany, then that part of the route that takes place in Germany is also a taxable provision of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">The non-resident tax resident must notify the competent tax authority before carrying out his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax authority shall register this non-resident taxable person (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable transport in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 January 2004, the As of March 31, 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers who carried out passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the carriage of passengers is provided to a tax resident who is a taxable person for VAT, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax authority himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity which is obliged to pay VAT to the tax authority and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident tax resident is the tax resident who is the recipient of the services; this process is known as 'reverse charge' and complies with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the non-resident tax return and its VAT return, the German tax administration has several means of assessing the correctness of the taxable provision of passenger transport granted.</seg>
<seg id="234">The mobile control groups of the customs office carry out an audit of the certificates of buses authorised (licensed) for foreign transport, which are used for the carriage of passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, the mobile control groups shall send a control report to the relevant tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to request VAT from the bus driver before continuing to transport further.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident tax resident may deduct the VAT thus paid on the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts as to the accuracy of the VAT return, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit, which must take place at the tax authority's office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if a non-resident tax resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If a review of the VAT return or the fulfilment of the obligations of a non-resident tax return is to be carried out, BRH considers all such means of administrative cooperation to be too labour intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for the taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the accounts of a non-resident tax resident raises disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">Tax administration must audit foreign accounting, which does not only mean the need to know a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident tax member may not only accept the right to carry out an inspection which is due to his national tax administration, but also the right to carry out an audit by other Member States in which he carries passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, in each Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations applicable to it in those Member States, in all languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore raises disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between individual EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, entitled to deduction.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport is provided in Germany by an unsettled payer for the first time, he is obliged to notify the competent tax authority in advance of the provision of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to grant in Germany the taxable provision of part of the transport in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">The implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office carry out passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the effort, the tax revenue, if implemented, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 June 2006 on the approximation of the following directive of 2006/112/EC of 28 June 2006 on the approximation of the following directive On 15 November 2006, on the common system of VAT, they are burdened with time consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate costs to assess VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should only be taxed in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider resides.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require the adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to file a VAT return within 25 days after the end of the tax year on the form prescribed by the MF, even if he has not incurred any tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is payable within the time limit for filing the VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., for which the tax maturity is determined by customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a refundable overpayment arises as a result of the assessment of the excessive deduction, the payer shall be returned to the payer without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings relating to the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with article 73(1)(a) of the Basic Regulation, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 11 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. may be exercised in the ordinary VAT return no later than for the last tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">After the expiry of that period, the right to deduct may be further exercised within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised first.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible by submitting an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1 January 2004 1. 2005 allows the submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be applied for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the summary of corrections increases the tax liability, b) performs a correction at which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only the data previously claimed by the tax entity, c) performs the correction of the rate and amount of the tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the summary of corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The filing of a VAT return in electronic form can be done both via the Internet or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submission via the Internet may be made as a submission with a data message bearing a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not provided by a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of submission with a data report not provided by a guaranteed electronic signature, submission in writing is still required, i.e. the delivery of the computer report to the tax authorities (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines related to intra-Community delivery/acquisition values.</seg>
<seg id="277">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated scan within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of the supply of goods to other Member States to tax-registered persons in other Member States shall be compared with the information given in the summary reports submitted by the Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from tax-registered persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through VIES from recapitulative reports of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The Tax Office is taking a test of the credibility of VAT returns within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is carried out automatically, as vat returns cannot be measured without the test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The trust test involves calculating trust criteria and evaluating risky types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">In accordance with the provisions of Article 37(1) of the Basic Regulation, the commission is required to In accordance with Article 1 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the Tax Office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply with the obligation of a non-monetary nature under this or a special tax law, or imposed by a decision under that Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system used by the FA to technically support tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">By checking the SAO, it was found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility to impose a fine on the payers for not submitting a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit advance VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by 10 April 2018. the day following the quarter in which VAT occurs (Section 18(2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year or if it is a newly created undertaking, the relevant entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return by 10 June 2009. the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if a refund has been made in the past year which exceeded EUR 6 136 (Section 18(2a) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns do not have to be filed unless the amount of the annual VAT exceeds EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT tax shall be paid by 10 April 2006. the day following the tax period in which vat was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no deadlines (by law) for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to return the tax in a timely way, it is possible to offer collateral for the amount to be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process vat returns and return the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act provides for the possibility to extend this period (Section 18(6) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension should be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability a month later, provided that in the case of a monthly return a special deposit is paid.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be settled against the December VAT tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the entrepreneur must file a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 December 2006, is granted by 31 December 2005, the vat return is granted in accordance with the From 1 May of the following calendar year, registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur can not correct the erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Correction of the annual VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the payer is possible within the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payers are required to file their vat pre-tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">Tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule in order to avoid excessive hardness.</seg>
<seg id="311">The filing of an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either certified or without it.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is carried out without certification, the payer must submit the declaration once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">In the event that the payer does not submit vat returns, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the case of late filing, the payer may be fined (up to 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">During a previous inspection, the BRH found that the tax authorities often did not charge this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard fine therefore fails to meet its objective of shortening the average delay, especially when submitting an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines related to intra-Community delivery/acquisition values.</seg>
<seg id="319">The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate tax return/VAT line.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns which are submitted in paper form, a copy must be made either through the scanner or by the staff specially entrusted with it.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from vat returns submitted electronically is immediately available to the tax authority staffer.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data has been entered into the system, RMS personnel will pass them and select cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The selected VAT returns must be checked by the tax authority employee on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration must roughly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer must pay, the estimated tax must be as precise as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, the payers submit a VAT return within 25 days after the end of the tax year.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the amount of the payer's turnover, the tax period is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, the payers submit advance VAT returns, depending on the tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or the month.</seg>
<seg id="331">Until 31 December 2005, the Import From 1 May of the following year, the payers are obliged to file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the payer corrects the intra-Community transactions awarded, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative statement is filed;</seg>
<seg id="335">– the Federal States do not normally compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German payers before the annual VAT return is processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with registration (see 4.1.3), German payers are obliged to file an annual VAT return regardless of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German financial authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax authority is able to compare the annual VAT return with the returns for direct taxes and with the final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from the submitted income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The recapitulative statement ('SH') is submitted in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. of the payer who made the supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the delivered goods are always given in Czech currency broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on the services provided shall not be included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">Sh shall be submitted to the locally competent tax authority for each calendar quarter for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="348">The correction of the erroneous data is carried out in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">The erroneous data given in sh are always replaced by the data given in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">As well as tax returns, both the payer and the SH can file in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer does not submit sh or subsequent SH and had them pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. submitted, asked by the tax administrator to file it and at the same time instructs him on the consequences in the event of non-submission of sh or subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax administrator is entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for non-compliance with non-pecuniary obligations.</seg>
<seg id="352">By checking the SAO, it was found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for non-compliance with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of sh submissions, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to submit a SH does not affect the vat liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 para. 5 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. data in sh, or in the subsequent SH, to examine, remove any confusion and use the data for the determination of tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the event of a mismatch of the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payer with the monthly tax period) or the relevant (payer with a quarterly tax period) vat return, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the tax liability granted as specified in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">Erroneous data in sh the tax entity removes by filing a subsequent SH itself, or may be invited to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct the information on the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the payer does not demonstrate the data specified in the SH (or subsequent SH) and corrects them by filing a subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax administrator has demonstrated that the information given by the payer in the SH or the subsequent SH is not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator does not replace the submission of the tax entity by inserting a correction without filing a subsequent SH, it merely modifies the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from sh shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">They may be sent and received only by a national financial authority intended to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is CLO (in the Czech Republic it performs this function of MF, department of international cooperation in the administration of VAT (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automatic message that clo receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Contains any bad VAT IDs listed in the sent SH lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the bad VAT ID is used in one of the migrated regular SH or subsequent SH rows, a record is made to the wrong VAT ID table.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "Notice of doubt on VAT ID".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and indicate the acquisition values on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of the acquired goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return and in the value of the delivered goods, as stated by payers from other Member States in their SH, are sent from CLO to the tax office for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax authorities are obliged to investigate irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There are three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant vat return lines is lower than the value of the delivery declared by eu payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator shall verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">(b) The difference amount is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects his SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself will file an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether, despite this fact, he will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech tax payer has indicated in the relevant vat return lines, is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared by eu payers.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here, too, it is at the discretion of the controller whether to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After examining the difference and clarifying the causes of its occurrence, the tax administrator shall indicate to ADIS the result of the verification.</seg>
<seg id="380">The scan results are transmitted back to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">Graph 1 (n/ GRAPH) shows the number of cases sent from CLO to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="382">Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from CLO to the tax authorities decreased for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">There was a significant decrease in the number in the 4th year of the year. quarter 2005. THE DUTY has increased the minimum financial limit, inter alia, by increasing the amount of the aid. with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between the vat return data and the EU data may not always be caused by an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or a mistake resulting from the fact that certain types of transactions may be entered into sh in different ways in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="386">Table 1 is the most common reasons for irregularities in the values of reported transactions detected in the audited tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in tripartite transactions are required to submit a quarterly SH in which intra-Community deliveries are reported by beneficiaries (Section 18a(1) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">Sh must be administered by 10 April 2009. the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the extension of this period is allowed in the case of preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">CLO must be supplied.</seg>
<seg id="392">From 1 January 2005, the They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be allowed by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardness.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers become aware that incorrect information is provided in the SH, it is necessary to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers do not submit sh, CLO will initiate proceedings in order to enforce the submission of this report.</seg>
<seg id="396">Part of this procedure is: – first reminder – the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine/penalty payment and – the assessment of the penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows fines of up to EUR 25 000 (Section 329 AO), CLO levies fines in three steps, in amounts of EUR 125, 250 and EUR 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a para. 1 No 5 UStG provides that payers act unlawfully if they do not intentionally or negligently submit a SH, submit them incomplete, do not submit them on time or if they do not correct or repair a late SH at all.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punishable by a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Information on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the Tax Office because sh processing is the exclusive task of CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data is stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">Therefore, data from SH are only visually available to the Tax Office after their processing to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The time limits for sh processing are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Sh data must be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">In the event of incorrect VAT IDs being mentioned in the SH of German payers, CLO receives O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">CLO contacts a specific entrepreneur and asks him for the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the inspection, BRH found that most entrepreneurs had corrected the VAT ID at clo's request.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, threat and assessment of the three additional fines take up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The Tax Office rejected the exemption of declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file a corrected SH on CLO, as the tax authorities cannot repair the data in VIES themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">THE BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so the payers often failed to comply with the requests.</seg>
<seg id="415">In view of the fact that CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, a comparison of the data on the supply of goods granted in the VAT return and in sh shall not take place before the submission of such data to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This check can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied when preparing a VAT check.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States are processed at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and are subsequently submitted to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">This data is used for the purpose of the acquisition control carried out by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, CLO checks them on the basis of a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is created and sent to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created at a later date and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">Rms installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure shall subsequently check these data with data on intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have made the delivery of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State shall submit sh to the locally competent tax authority within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities shall process the SH and transmit the data to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, indicated by the payer in the SH, are compared at the tax authorities with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State indicated by those payers in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who have made intra-Community delivery are obliged to submit a QUARTERLY SH until 10 January 2010. the day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers are administered to CLO, from 1 January to 31 December 2005. 1. 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities have information from sh available only after their processing to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Payers from the Czech Republic and Germany list only the supply of goods in SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in sh.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the erroneous lines filed by sh.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to the german VIES data, the incorrect VAT ID was not corrected even if the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FU.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the information on intra-Community supplies that are included in the Vat return of the German payer and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">The differences between the data of these two statements are not usually established before the German CLO provides data from VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">In view of the BRH findings, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison shall be carried out separately by clo for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are passed on to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the tax returns of the payers.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is processed only for payers who are not fully entitled to the deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is designated for inspection anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of rms.</seg>
<seg id="447">Combating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that may be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if the payers are given SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, since most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to file tax returns for VAT on a monthly basis – and SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, the filing of sh may be linked to the filing of a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to submit a SH monthly would cause more time differences between the reporting of intra-Community delivery and intra-Community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between the customs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the German Federal Government considered the general provisions of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed because of the doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that the monthly submission of data from VIES to CLO of other Member States could lead to confusion and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the obligation to monthly SH and monthly data transmission were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European monthly SH standard.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In the framework of foreign trade, Germany is the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods made between the Czech Republic and Germany are listed in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT registration numbers or VAT IDs contained in reports O_MCTL transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the period audited.</seg>
<seg id="461">This information is contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">This may be due to different basis for determining the number of messages O_MCTL.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which sh was filed, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the report was O_MCTL received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International Level 3 Information Exchange</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables tax authorities to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-Community business transactions and the payers who have carried out such transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between the two basic categories of exchange of information, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request is carried out in the form of a so-called "data exchange". requests for information ('The ZOI'), using standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax authorities from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI or replies to the ŽOI delivered through the financial directorates to CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided on standardised SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">CLO also secures the income of the YOI from other Member States and the responses to the submitted ŽOI, their translation into Czech and distribution to locally competent tax authorities for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">In Article 3(1) of Regulation ( 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 provides for a maximum period for the processing of the ZOI to be 3 months after receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="473">All ŽOI, transmitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany, were subjected to inspections of the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total of 94 ŽOI received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 were cases (i.e. 74.5 %) within the three-month period, a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) has been settled after that period and the remaining 1 case has not been sent to the Germany until the SAO is checked.</seg>
<seg id="475">Graph 2 provides more detailed information on the deadlines within which replies to ŽOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the 335 ŽOI shipped from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 were in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received within the three-month period, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) requests were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) the reply from Germany was not received until the SAO was checked (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the data transmitted when the reply from The Germany was received).</seg>
<seg id="477">Graph 3 provides more detailed information on the deadlines within which replies to ŽOI sent to Germany were sent to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage of intra-Community transaction values presented in the ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany is graph 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the chart above, the value of commercial transactions examined through the ŽOI was most often in the band above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax authorities from other Member States are often passed on to tax authorities from other Member States without prior request information which may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information shall be transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">'Automatic exchange' means, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at pre-determined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax authorities from the Form Of The Report on the Delivery of a New Means of Transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">The tax administrator shall complete the necessary data in a specially crafted template and transmit it to the contact officer at the Financial Directorate, where the data are collected and within the specified deadline, i.e. by a deadline. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which this information was available, the CLO shall be transmitted to the CUSTOMS for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on vat-exempt mail sales in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU operations that appear to be unjustified and information on potential "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly to the German CLO, which transmits scac forms to foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form you use is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information audited by brh were sent in order to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State, or to demonstrate the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supplies of goods or services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">In the absence of a reasonable reason for this request, the German CLO shall reject any application containing an amount below that fixed limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To respond to a request for information, CLO shall send the request to the relevant tax authority, asking for a three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no additional deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has technical conditions for monitoring past time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to the answer to unfilled requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities shall obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only relate to one commercial operation that has been carried out recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has demonstrated its usefulness in investigating individual taxable business operations.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the context of automatic exchange without prior request, germany provides other Member States with information – on THE VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States – on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, the Germany has undertaken to provide other Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, b. sending or catalogue sale in other Member States which is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-community acquisitions declared by the payer and data from VIES, provided by other Member States, d. intra-community delivery of goods not declared by the German payer in SH because the deliveries were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential "trade missingr" , which carried out intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied the goods to potential "missing traders" or to those recipients who misused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The sending of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated in both the Czech Republic and germany by locally competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (English) and translates the information sent into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the order that they write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a monolingual form.</seg>
<seg id="511">German CLO does not provide translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">By examining the ŽOI transmitted between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, the 5. 2004 to 31 December 2004 On 12. 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration handled 74.5% of the applications received within the specified three-month period, while žOI shipped to Germany were settled by the German tax administration within the specified time limit in only 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO warns the tax authorities of a three-month period, it does not track the elapsed time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of missing warnings is a large number of delayed responses to the ZOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Due to these problems, BRH recommended that you carry out regular warnings on CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, the German CLO is now drawing the attention of the tax authorities to the answer to the unfinished answers to the ZOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several departments at various organisational levels of tax administration are engaged in the management of vat risks.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the MF, the following services deal with the issues of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and Performance of VAT and within it the report Risk Management in the field of VAT, which, inter alia, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends of these risks at domestic and Community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">It coordinates nationally the operation of the Trust of VAT Tax Returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risk commodities, processes conceptually the management of VAT risks and cooperates in this area with the relevant EU institutions and other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">Department of International Cooperation in VAT Management, which, among other things, has been used for the development of the vat system. it ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT registration numbers or VAT IDs contained in reports O_MCTL transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the period audited.</seg>
<seg id="527">This information is contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">This may be due to different basis for determining the number of messages O_MCTL.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which sh was filed, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the report was O_MCTL received.</seg>
<seg id="531">Department of Tax Control and Search Methodology, which, among other things, has been used for the construction of tax control and search methodologies. conducts risk analysis in the framework of the methodological management of tax controls and, in line with the risk analysis, sets priorities for the targeting of tax controls in the plans of the financial directorates, processes risk analyses in the context of the reduction of tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge gained from tax administration and from other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">In the financial directorates, search departments are set up, which carry out, inter alia, the financial research departments. the search for tax entities and areas that are at risk from the point of view of the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, the pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax entities for the risks of tax evasion (e.g. in the field of internet services, mediation, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of chain fraud links and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">A specialised control unit is set up at selected 12 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence, tax checks outside the territorial jurisdiction of the tax authorities are carried out on the basis of a mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up a separation of specialised tax controls has emerged on the basis of the increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur mainly among chain-connected entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on the control of tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax entities of a large scale of activity in terms of turnover size.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms have been integrated into ADIS to reduce VAT risks: – the role of Credibility of VAT Returns, used to assess the risk iness of tax returns, – the role of selecting tax entities for inspection, allowing the choice of payer criteria to be selected for control, – the role of VIES, through which tax authorities have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES enables: – to verify the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States, – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in sh by all its suppliers from other Member States, – to generate a report of payers who have not submitted sh, – to carry out a formal check of the data that the payers from the Czech Republic have provided in the Sh, before sending this data to other Member States, – to generate a report of payers for which the information on the supply of goods to other Member States, as indicated in the VAT returns, does not match the data in the SH, – to generate a report of payers for which the value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States indicated in the VAT returns does not match the data declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">In the context of activities to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax authorities have access to registers of government bodies such as the tax authorities. commercial register, land register, motor vehicle register, trade register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (in particular CLO) and the tax administration of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither CLO nor federal tax administrations share a completely consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At CLO level, ST I 2 ('KUSS' – Coordination Unit for Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigations) collects the findings of a control on tax fraud in a specific database called the OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS has established, in cooperation with the tax authorities, a new database called ZAUBER designed to transfer the names of companies of tax cheats "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">Kuss experience is reflected in rms development in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, several other CLO and MF specialists are entrusted with rms duties and powers.</seg>
<seg id="549">At CLO level, a formal control of the composition of the VAT IDs of other Member States in sh submitted by German payers is in place.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out before the provision of SH data to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Verification of the validity of the VAT IDs specified in the SH is based on the codes O_MCTL provided by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting an invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, RMS on CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually feature in the so-called "control system". carousel business operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".</seg>
<seg id="553">The tax authorities of the Länder are instructed to process these control reports and, in some cases, report on the results of their CLO findings.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case (instead of an exclusive focus on the company's turnover) is to be envisaged with sufficient probability.</seg>
<seg id="555">The BRH therefore proposed to the MF that different characteristics be taken into account when processing reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">RMS should also penalise other factors, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour (morale), the field (of economic activity) or the structure of the shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the Federal States and focused on the processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, RMS generates a list of those payers who have reported intra-community delivery in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is posted to CLO to monitor the full administration of SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with data from the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="561">The Tax Administration of the Federal States seeks to avoid comparing quarterly data because such comparisons would reveal too much dissenting data, which is attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; Such as:</seg>
<seg id="562">– different execution time of the intra-Community transaction, in the supplier's view, on the one hand, and the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting of sales discounts and sales actions (incentives) and their different reporting in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and VIES, many Federal States have introduced RMS elements based on VAT return data and some other facts (such as the structure of the company name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer's payment behaviour/ morality).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced rules-based RMS that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (risk managers) to program their own rules for earmarking potential tax fraud perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process a monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">The competent tax authority will therefore receive a recommendation made by RMS before VAT is determined.</seg>
<seg id="568">Because this RMS is unable to reflect current findings into its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The Administrative District of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data from tax files in which the inspection detected tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">On the basis of this data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">RMS creates a list of tax files that are suspected of tax evasion once a month.</seg>
<seg id="572">The competent tax authorities use this list as a basis for auditing decisions of proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the auditors must report their findings in order to reflect the results of the list into RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The North Rhine-Westphalia administrative region uses an adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data assessed tax returns for VAT and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or system of collection of potentially useful information (so-called data-mining system) calculates the likelihood that a particular taxpayer has committed a tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraud perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="577">Local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for inspection and notify the findings of the control to the Data Processing Centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of any of these three RMS in the other Länder is also ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">Given that none of these three RMS are based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as different approaches in the three Federal States of Germany, the RMS of each EU country has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">Eu Member States' tax authorities are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – does not prove to be a national problem, but rather a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in several states.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">The LOSS of VAT caused by fraud in the EU does not have to hit the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange and a debate on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected check findings when validating business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">In the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel control actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">Furthermore, the two audit institutions jointly examined the execution of several commercial transactions in which there were doubts as to their implementation or irregularities in the way in which the payers from both countries reported those commercial transactions in their VAT and SH tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="595">At brh's request, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">Furthermore, in 43 cases, the SAO examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH on the basis of brh notices.</seg>
<seg id="597">BRH examined a total of 23 cases at the request of the SAO concerning commercial transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">By examining selected cases, it was also a case of the use of the product. different way of registering in EU Member States leads to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the data in VIES, the Czech payer was to be acquired in iii. 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.</seg>
<seg id="602">Since the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 29 869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to check the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">In response to the ŽOI delivered from germany, the German party stated that in The II. In 2004, the German payer delivered goods worth EUR 27 381 to the Czech payer, in III. eur 31 997 and in IV. 2004, worth EUR 10 276.</seg>
<seg id="604">Furthermore, the reply showed that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28 April 2004. 9. 2004, but in 2006, following an additional request from the German payer for the vat ID, the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate of validity of the VAT ID from 1 January 2006. 5. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer carried out the SH correction.</seg>
<seg id="606">For the Czech payer, on the basis of this information, it was the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">The SAO found that the Czech taxpayer, following an investigation by the tax administrator, submitted additional VAT returns for each tax year 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine whether the values of deliveries from the above-mentioned German supplier were included.</seg>
<seg id="609">Brh found, at the request of the SAO, that the German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not ask for a VAT ID when registering, he was assigned only an identification number for transactions within germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible to assign a VAT ID retroactively to a payer in Germany, in this case the German tax officer in 2006 retroactively assigned the VAT ID to the aforementioned German payer VAT as of 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively, unless the German entrepreneur caused a delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by CLO after the payer's request for a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community delivery under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other hand, the German consignee does not need a valid VAT ID of his supplier in order to report intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these different procedures between Member States, the German DUTY in this particular case allocated the VAT ID retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Czech tax administrator requested, as part of the international exchange of information on the verification of the registration of the German payer for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES listed the date of registration 5. 3. 2005, the date 1 January 2005 of the German payer's registration certificate issued by the german tax authority at the locally competent tax office indicated the date of 1 January 2005. 10. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a reply received from Germany, the German party stated that the German tax entity had been registered from 1 January 2004. 10. 2004, but the VAT ID was granted to him in Germany for organisational reasons until 16 December 2004. 2. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxpayer for the tax year III. 2004 to II. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">By this inspection, the Tax Office found that the Czech payer included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) provided to the German payer in the period prior to his registration for VAT (i.e. before 1 January 2004). 10. 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax year III. In the quarter of 2004, the tax office paid VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="623">BRH found, at the request of the SAO, the German payer's VAT ID had been assigned up to 16. 2. 2005, when he informed the Tax Office of his business, which he started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 January 2004. In order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004, it is necessary to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer reported an intra-community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approx. CZK 5000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech payer declared in the VAT return for September 2004 and sh for III. In 2004, the delivery of goods worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When verifying the registration of the German payer in VIES, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 January 2004. 11. 2004, i.e. after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer submitted an additional DAP for VAT, in which he declared a taxable amount on the transactions carried out in the country of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692) paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">By asking the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer subsequently submitted a request for a retrial in respect of an additional VAT return and as an evidence he submitted a confirmation to the German tax administration that the German payer had been tax-led since 1 January 2004. 1. 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from Germany showed that the Vat ID had not been assigned to the German payer until 11 December 2004. 11. 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that the case was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods because the German payer received the VAT ID up to 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German beneficiary declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared VAT on that acquisition when it requested an input tax refund in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, in the absence of changes in the value of VAT which the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the information in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">Furthermore, BRH found that the name of the German payer referred to in ŽOI was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in a confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005, worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, in which he verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had posted and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer had been registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 January 2004. 4. 2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German payer's registration certificate so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Tax Office assessed the transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany and therefore did not subsequently assess the tax on the Czech payer from that business transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that, under German legislation, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID assigned in order for intra-Community supplies of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have at his disposal the VAT ID of the pro-customer from another Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act, this was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be levied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any event, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction because the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to reply to the ZOI concerning intra-Community transactions of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to data from VIES in III, the Czech payer had a total of 100,000, according to data from VIES. to purchase goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer in the quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax audit on the tax entity for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the international administrative cooperation, he requested the German tax administration, by means of the SCAC form, to verify the delivery of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the german company and that the acquisition of those goods had not been posted in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the requirement to provide evidence — contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory justification was provided.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax administrator did not obtain the means of proof for the assessment of the tax on the goods acquired, he terminated the tax audit without finding it and the tax liability remained measured in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">Brh found, at the request of the SAO, that the German payer had acted as a so-called "payer". "fiscal representative" (§ 22 a – e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer reported those deliveries in his annual VAT return and in SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was granted the right to receive the exemption.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the BRH warning, the German Tax Office will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the national tax on purchased goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the specified three-month period more often than replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO found out by the inspection that the Czech tax administration sent a text of the tax authorities on 5 April 2005 to the Commission. 10. 2005 to Germany request information concerning the examination of the value of the delivered goods for 4. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer reported in SH the delivery of goods to the Czech payer for this period worth EUR 86 307, but the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods in the same period in the VAT return only corresponding to EUR 35 314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the ZOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9. 5. 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the processing period provided for in Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the commission 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request could not be processed since the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">By failing to comply with the deadline for the settlement of the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, to verify the supply of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German payer, carried out in III. and IV. 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that no reply was received from the SRN until the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="667">Furthermore, by asking the local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT tax return the supply of new means of transport for that German payer worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">AT THE REQUEST OF THE SAO, BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not forward the abovementioned ŽOI to the locally competent tax authority for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following brh's warning, a check was carried out in Germany by the German acquirer, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the relevant cars had been sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to data from VIES, the Czech payer was to be acquired in IV. in the quarter of 2004, a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="672">The acquisition of these goods was not accepted by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after the calls of the tax administrator, so the tax office gave him a refund on 23 June 2005. 5. 2005, for the period October to December 2004, he charged a VAT of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 July 2005, the Council adopted Decision 6. 2005 CLO drew attention to the abovementioned delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Because the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, he sent the ŽOI tax administrator to Germany concerning the above-mentioned supply.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the answer to ŽOI was delivered to the Czech Republic only on 7. 2. 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO inspection how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by the international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The Tax Office abolished the Czech payer on 23 December 2004 due to non-compliance with the obligations under the VAT Act. 8. 2005 VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the ŽOI because the control carried out by the tax authorities on the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH inspection:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, to verify the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to a German payer, carried out in III. 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In reply to the ŽOI, the German tax administrator stated that it had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for supplies worth EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">The BRH found, at the request of the SAO, that the control carried out by the German tax authority on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser reported the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in tax returns for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, by means of the SCAC form, to verify the supply of cars to a German payer worth EUR 198 167, carried out in IV. Quarter 2004 and QI 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the Czech Republic to the ŽOI, in which it confirmed the acquisition of certain cars by the German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that the Czech supplier was carried out by the competent tax authority locally to verify the drawdown of excessive VAT deductions, in which he did not find out their undue drawdown.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer had reported in that period in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579 114 and that the control carried out by the German tax authority on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intra-Community acquisition values indicated by the beneficiary in the tax return and the values indicated by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">The cases checked showed that the most common reasons for the differences were neither the time shift nor the incorrect value of intra-Community delivery of goods in sh:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">In the first quarter of 2005, according to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer was to purchase goods worth EUR 35 716 from the German payer, but the Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Because the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not take any activity at the company's registered office, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify in the framework of the international exchange of information how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The reply to the ŽOI received from Germany showed that, according to the german tax administration's findings, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods were taken over by the agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer supplied goods only worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent a false payment certificate of EUR 155 153 to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After the czech purchaser's fraudulent conduct was detected, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO, by asking the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, found that the tax administrator, among other things, had been responsible for the tax. on the basis of the information obtained, the Czech payer increased VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">BRH confirmed, on the basis of a sao request, that the German supplier reported only eur 7 916 after repairs of the delivery of the goods to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected values of the goods and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus, its SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested, by means of the SCAC form, to verify the supply of goods and services carried out in III. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods totalling EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer in order to verify this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line, including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">The individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and after 1 January 2004. 5. 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In III. In the quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued an invoice to the German payer for eur 107 100 for the installation and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer took over the invoices issued but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">Furthermore, by asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that all invoices are properly registered in the Czech payer's accounts.</seg>
<seg id="713">In vat returns for III. in the quarter of 2005, only the amounts supported by the Czech payer relating to invoicing after 1 January 2005 are indicated. 5. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that, on the basis of a response from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction involved the delivery of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including assembly services.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of the so-called where the production line has been installed.</seg>
<seg id="716">Under the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the service is obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the beneficiary may claim the deduction of VAT on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">In the absence of changes in the value of VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005, according to data from VIES.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for the examination of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the ŽOI, the German side stated that the machine had already been delivered by German payer C to the Czech payer B in 2004, but was to return the machine to German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, it emerged from the response to a request for information that the German payer C sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO, by asking the tax administrator of the locally competent payer B, found that, according to VIES data, the German payer C supplied in III. in the quarter of 2004 to the Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027.</seg>
<seg id="727">The payer B denied this acquisition of the goods, therefore the local tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the ŽOI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">By further investigation with payer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the accounts of payer B and that it could be a machine of the same type as the german payer C's organisational unit to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">Furthermore, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a local investigation on the local payer A.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had at his disposal an invoice from the German payer C of 7 December 2004. 2. 2005, to which payer A was listed as a customer of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounting.</seg>
<seg id="733">The payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, where the subject of the lease was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The handover of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9. 2. 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by a leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the response to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C did not deliver the machine to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognise the German payer C's VAT exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D supplied the machine to the Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, BRH found that german payer C reported in its SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not examined during the tax audit carried out by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above-mentioned business transactions.</seg>

<seg id="745">In an inspection of the received by the IAA, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had adopted on 4 December 2004 a report on the implementation of the tax authorities' financial year. 10. 2005 from Germany a request for information in which the German tax administrator requested verification of intra-Community supplies from a German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this case was a pretend intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The ŽOI further stated that the German payer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation on the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the statement of the managing director of the Czech company, in the above case it appeared to be a German payer's claim against the German tax administration, which was used by the Czech payer as a shareholder of the German company with the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator does not currently have any information that the German tax administration has dealt with the issue relating to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not a delivery of goods, yet this value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-Community delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not report intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to data from VIES, the German payer in III supplied the german payer in the quarter 2004 to QI 2005 to the Czech payer of goods with a total value of EUR 33 205. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator requested, as part of the international exchange of information on the verification of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the Czech payer's address, the remaining goods had been picked up by the Czech payer in person.</seg>
<seg id="757">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that before receiving the answer to the ŽOI, the Czech payer had submitted additional VAT returns for those periods.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in acquisition values were not resolved, therefore the Czech tax administrator recommended that the Czech payer carry out a tax check.</seg>
<seg id="759">The check has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. The German payer supplied, according to the data in VIES in III. czech goods payer of EUR 46 854.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, the Czech payer granted an intra-Community acquisition only amounting to eur 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator requested verification in the framework of the international exchange of information of the value of the supplies made.</seg>
<seg id="763">The reply to the ŽOI, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of delivery of goods of EUR 31 999, i.e. eur 31 999. corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="764">The SAO found that after receiving a reply from Germany, the SAO found that after receiving a reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Accounting Officer of the Czech payer and agreed to discuss with the owner of the additional VAT return for III after examining these invoices. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would proceed further to comply with the set deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax year.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">The German payer had in IV. in the quarter of 2004, the Czech payer delivered goods worth EUR 11 600.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged german payer's associate had set up several fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">When examining the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the czech payer's statement, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted proofs of sale of the goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not admit or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator informed them to the German tax administration in response to the ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">The SAO found that the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return for IV on the basis of the investigations carried out by the SAO. 2004, in which it included the value of the acquisition of goods, inter alia, from the German payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">Vat on the sale of goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return unchanged after the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to Czech legislation, the above case did not take the goods from other Member States because the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator therefore made an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that, immediately after receiving the reply to the ŽOI, which stated that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax return had been corrected and claimed VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent tax authority has sent a notification to the tax authority of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, the payers reported intra-Community transactions that may not have actually taken place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">An annex to the application was a copy of the Czech vat registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="786">A copy of the passport of the person who was to be said to have carried the car was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">By investigating the Czech tax administrator found that it was a stolen passport, the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied any contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German party, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was provided by the Czech tax administrator in response to the ŽOI, together with the communication that it could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">The SAO found that the Czech payer did not settle at the address specified in the Commercial Register and the company's managing director was non-contact.</seg>
<seg id="791">After the tax proceedings were carried out, the Czech tax administrator charged a tax liability of CZK 0 to the Czech taxpayer in the amount of february 2005.</seg>
<seg id="792">By further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question was sold to another Czech entity who bought it through an advertisement on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the German tax administrator responsible, on the basis of the Czech reply to the ŽOI, would not recognise the German payer's right to exempt that supply from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax authority was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3000 between the value of the goods acquired and the value granted from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was communicated that the Czech payer should have delivered during IV. quarter 2004 to 2005 to the German payer of goods worth EUR 89 424.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested the verification of supplies and their payment in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 December 2004. 7. 2005 and the new managing director was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to a companion of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed both VAT and SH tax returns, which, after the deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person – the said partner of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accounting officer of the Czech tax payer confirmed to the tax administrator that the company's shareholder had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash documents were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic found that the tax administrator had recognized the Czech payer as IV. In the quarter of 2004, the right to exemption from VAT on the supply of goods to another Member State of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42 145) and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47 548) for qi 1.</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany had not corrected the Vat return of the German acquirer because the German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolventness of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the previous check did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the assessed tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the data in VIES, in 2005, the German payer purchased goods worth EUR 4 251 196 from the Czech Republic after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In the 2004 tax return or in the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not report an intra-community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="807">Furthermore, it did not report reasonable supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these differences, the German tax authority, ŽOI, sent a copy of the report to the Commission on 4 April 2004. 2005 and 1 December 2005. quarter 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported intra-Community delivery of goods to the German payer for the two quarters in the two quarters, with a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 June 2005, the Council adopted Decision 9. 2006 was delivered to the ŽOI, in which the German party requested to check whether the Czech payer of reported intra-community supplies had been made.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the german side's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no managing director.</seg>
<seg id="812">As is apparent from the materials provided by the SAO to the competent tax administrator, on 30 June 2005, the commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC On 3. 2006, a protocol on the opening of the VAT control for IV was drawn up with the managing director of the Czech payer. 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the payer was invited by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above periods, but he did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the sole managing officer of the Czech payer ceased to be a member of the Office of the Czech Payer. 5. 2006, a new managing director was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech payer has stopped submitting VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the SAO's control in cooperation with BRH, he examined, among other things, several cases of intra-Community supplies made between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases examined was transmitted by the two SAIs through the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. The Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany has informed the competent tax authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) has received an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the supply of these wind farms on behalf, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to the lack of own capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the method of transport of wind farms:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of execution of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind farms to be installed under his name, at his risk and his account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the installation of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport began – in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the beneficiary is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of a German subcontractor (eD) could not receive an exemption because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">Transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The delivery of those wind farms that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The supply of other wind farms produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Thus, the Czech company (eCR) carried out both intra-Community delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intra-Community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany or to sh to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-Community delivery uniformly as intra-Community delivery from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (eCR) reported no intra-Community delivery to Austria, but intra-Community delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">A verification of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although this case shows no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the SAO and BRH examined the transactions in order to highlight the differences between the declaration in the tax return and the VIES data, which were caused by different VAT rules in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The cases audited also demonstrate that changes in legislation need time to put new legislation into practice by both payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In SH for II. to IV. In the quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-Community delivery to the German payer with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).</seg>
<seg id="841">Over the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intra-Community delivery to another German payer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576 970).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, in both cases it was a supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers reported the above deliveries in SH in accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">By further examining the above transactions, the SAO control group found that in 2004 there were differences in the legal arrangements for the supply or acquisition of electricity between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid version of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community delivery of goods, from the point of view of the German legal regulation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community acquisition, but a taxable transaction with the place of performance in the territory of germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in legal regulations in the Czech Republic was eliminated by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., which amends certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1. 1. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. In the examination of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was further found that the Czech payer reported in SH for 1 January 2004 that the czech payer had reported in THE SH for 1 January 2004, the commission had not been granted the right to pay. to 4 May 2005. In the quarter of 2005, intra-Community delivery to a German payer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) and another Czech payer reported intra-community delivery to the German payer for the same period, totalling EUR 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, in both cases it was a supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2004, the commission has been in force since 1 January 2004. 1. 2005, in the case of supply of electricity, the place of supply of electricity shall be the place of supply of electricity, the place where the purchaser has its registered office, the place of business or the establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have entered into the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that the two payers mentioned above reported intra-community supply of electricity in SH distorted the data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917 873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation met the objectives of BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAI gained a deeper knowledge of the VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the legislation in the field of VAT management differed.</seg>
<seg id="856">Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected during parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to examine them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the control findings, the two SAI made recommendations on VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="859">Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of a follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two control institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT management checks.</seg>

<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are given in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on transports in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 compared the SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which was transmitted to him by the SAO SR at the beginning of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data to reliably reconcile individual transports, and therefore only 63% of the traffic started was assigned.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transports were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on transports started in the Czech Republic and completed in slovakia in the months of October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which contained all the data according to the accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the commenced transports were clearly assigned.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">In most cases, the amount of alcohol was indicated in litres, but it was possible to convert it into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the database of the percentage of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">The quantity of tobacco products was indicated in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms by type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">For shipments initiated in the Czech Republic, the termination of which was not reliably verified in the Slovak database or for which the indication of the quantity of products transported was not matched, an inspection of the accompanying documents was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="120">The accompanying documents for 487 transports of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were subjected to the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="121">Checks of these documents were carried out at the customs offices at which the SAO-CR carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="122">For transports authorised by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested through DGC.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 transports, for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic have not documented the certified copy No. 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products indicated on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">Furthermore, data on transports registered in the Slovak database were transmitted to the Slovak side, but the database did not contain the transport database of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SU SR found 95 transports in the Slovak Customs Administration database.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 46 transports were verified by the local customs authorities, which have been provided with copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side forwarded copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side, on the basis of which the transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transports carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of commenced transports.</seg>
<seg id="128">By checking these cases, the following were found to be:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 shipments of alcohol were recorded in the Slovak transport database in total quantities of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 liters of alcohol transport in total in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-CR found that it was the transport of taxed products, for which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The consignor informed the tax administrator in writing of the commencement of the transport. He carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 transports of mineral oils were registered in the Slovak transport database, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, totalling 173,000. litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out transport of 102,000. litres of un taxed mineral oils without proper authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax entity held a special authorisation for the reception and use of exempt products, on the basis of which the un taxed products could only be supplied to the holder of the same authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="135">The commencement of transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic was not notified and he did not provide a tax security of CZK 1,207,680 for the products transported.</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax entity shipped 71,000 in the territory of the SR. litres of taxed mineral oils. Even in these cases, he did not fulfil his legal obligation by not notifying the customs office of the commencement of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="137">The consignor may start transport of products placed for free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the start of transport.</seg>

<seg id="143">The customs authorities in the Slovak Customs Have registered these services in the database under the conditional exemption procedure, since the accompanying documents did not indicate that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the database of transport of the Czech customs administration with the database of transport of the Slovak customs administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- the quantity of products transported has been reported inconsistently in the databases, e.g. in the case of the quantities of products transported; mineral oil is indicated in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; the alcohol was indicated in litres or litres of alcohol, making it more difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of alcohol transported in the invoices did not match the quantity recorded in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices were included in the databases,</seg>

<seg id="190">The customs authorities checked the requested data and notified the result of the investigation through ELO to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the SAO-CR and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic in the initiation and termination of the transport of products under the conditional exemption procedure between the two states, the registration of such transports and the comparison of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 By comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">(a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax authorities when initiating the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of products under the conditional exemption regime can be started by a tax entity in the Czech Republic only with the agreement of the tax administrator, who will allow the start of transport, provided that the transported products have been provided with a tax security amount of the tax attributable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The commencement of the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme in the SR shall not be subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the period audited, the tax entity was obliged to notify the tax authorities of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">The transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could have started without informing the tax administrator of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all excise laws were progressively adopted in the Czech Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the conditional exemption procedure is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office which is locally competent to the consignor before the start of transport;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy No. 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification no later than the next working day after the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">Certified copy No. 3 is obliged to send to the consignor no later than the next working day after its receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in the SR is obliged to send to the consignor of the products copy No. 3 certified by the tax administrator and the recipient of the products no later than 15. the day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. The customs authorities in the Czech Republic keep electronic records of the transport of products under the suspensive exemption procedure.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping this register is not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="206">The customs authorities in both countries shall enter in the register all the data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under the conditional exemption procedure between Member States of the European Union to allow excise managers in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Pursuant to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2003 on the protection of the european communities's products,[ The information shall be asked to be asked by the Authorities of the It is envisaged that the electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duty should be established.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of the contract for cooperation in control activities, the Czech party handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption procedure initiated in slovakia and completed in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak party handed over to the Czech party a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption procedure initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3 319 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared the data on the transports mentioned in the records of commenced transports in the Czech Republic with the registration of transports completed in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption procedure initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">The comparison of data was hampered by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not uniformly reported in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly assign data on individual transports in both records, an inspection of the accompanying documents was carried out and breaches of the suspensive exemption regime and cases of tax evasion were not detected.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the basis of the findings of parallel controls, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the transport records to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow for the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under the conditional exemption procedure within the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value added tax administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of the follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxation is generally a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It goes without saying that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Examples include value added tax fraud (hereinafter also 'VAT').</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the "EU").</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as 2005, participants in the VI had become more interested in the use of the the euroai congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solution, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrenungshof, hereinafter referred to as "BRH") carried out the first parallel control action in the field of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is widespread throughout the EU, close cooperation between the SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to tackle this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a subsequent parallel check.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Check number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of inspection: (CZ) Value added tax administration (D) Bilateral audit with THE SAO (follow-up)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the control action was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The control action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other VAT-related areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were intended to be compared with the proven best practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The period audited was the years 2006 to 2008, in the case of material contexts, the period preceding and following, until the completion of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">The follow-up control of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected during previous parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further vetting.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the control findings, the two SAIs made recommendations on VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up control action carried out was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The check was further targeted, e.g. by the commission. selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in debt collection and the implementation of VAT controls on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When checking vat management in selected areas in both countries, the inspectors reached the following control findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from the previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: The conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel checks, comparisons of VAT registration systems in both countries found differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different forms of registration cause problems, the two SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation has been presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT payers' vat identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also amended common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="39">THE SAI expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of that document, agreed by the EU Member States under ECOFIN, no longer contains the issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant tool for prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly reporting of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="44">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for reporting, allowing for a more timely examination of intra-community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion reduces the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions are reported to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2007. It was implemented from 1 January 2010, and was implemented in Germany from 1 January 2010. They are very, on 17 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit monthly summaries was not introduced within the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, whereas in the Czech Republic it did.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of vat declaration data and summary reports in Germany in order to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of the interconnection of the two VAT return systems and for summary reports</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, the two SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraudulent activity will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The inspection found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their advantages and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO has carried out a eurocanet review, which allows for the exchange of information within the EU, while brh has focused on German participation in the so-called 'eurocalnet'. risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected intra-Community transactions cases</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous control action, commercial transactions were jointly examined for which there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or summary reports to tax payers from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAIs selected nine cases for follow-up, which included intra-community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not concluded at the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent control action verified that most of the tax proceedings in relation to the selected cases of commercial transactions between the czech republic and Germany were closed and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT assessment or avoidance of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Control of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-Community transactions carried out by EU payers included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky tax payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States' participation in this system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is not satisfactory for an active participant in the system if some Member States refuse to participate.</seg>
<seg id="67">In view of the fact that the German tax administration did not engage in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information as to which suppliers with the German VAT ID were assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the control action, the SAO identified both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax authorities have limited possibilities for controlling risky transactions, in particular with regard to so-called 'risk transactions'. missing traders, while the mere physical examination of documents can hardly prove to the tax entity any fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation arises for tax authorities when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in the transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to participate actively in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">Other tools are used in Germany to detect risky tax payers, which have so far proven themselves to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, experience needs to be communicated and exchanged between EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU has reached political agreement on the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is to create a EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in using EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new vat fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the field of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the SAI agrees that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to analyse, on the basis of more detailed statistics, an analysis to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the opinion of both SAIs, this means assistance for Member States with low recovery rates, so that they can increase the recovery rate to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter referred to as 'VDS') in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, in the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax authorities on areas which the SAI considered essential to the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">It is clear from the responses received that the situation in both countries is developing differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system for regulating the selection of risk-prone cases, which is based on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, data from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2012, a dedicated tax office for the administration of the VDS is planned.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is no similar system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far been more focused on selecting the individual cases in question, in particular on the basis of the VAT return data and the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of this data is based on various risk management components that will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Course of control action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The inspection was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Division II. - the revenue department of the state budget and the territorial departments IX. Plzen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited persons were: The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter referred to as "FÚ"): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ in Břeclav, FÚ in Domažlice, FÚ in Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ v Kraslice , FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava III, FÚ in Písek, FÚ in Pilsen, FÚ for Prague 1, FÚ for Prague 4, FÚ for Prague 8, FÚ in Rakovník, FÚ in Sokolov, FÚ in Tábor, FÚ in Vysoké Mýto, FÚ in Zlín and FÚ in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The conclusion of this control action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2005. They will forthed information on the</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Progress of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The inspection was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Indirect Taxation Control Unit and the staff of designated regional control offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the control action.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit event took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following tax authorities included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, negotiations took place with the tax authorities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-south) and the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The report on the control findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In September 2008, a meeting of representatives of the two control institutions was held to discuss and identify the topics of control in preparation for parallel control actions.</seg>
<seg id="113">Later, in December 2008, the leaders of both AIDs signed a cooperation agreement in the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At the Bonn meeting in June 2009, the control teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on a further procedure.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on 2 and 2 December 2005. - 4. They shall forthwith inform the Council of their information on the</seg>
<seg id="116">The control teams exchanged the findings accumulated by then and agreed together a timetable for drawing up a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report when implementing parallel control actions; • examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel check, • examination of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases , • control of the international tax administration procedure for the recovery of VAT debts • tax controls of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of parallel control actions was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Control of VAT management in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">The conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">On the basis of the results of the previous control action, the SAO recommended the modification of the conditions for registration for VAT and the introduction of a new rule for the deregistration of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The revised conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that, in some cases, the tax authorities did not use the right to cancel the VAT registration of payers who did not fulfil the obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax ('the VAT Act').</seg>
<seg id="127">The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed an amendment to the provision of the obligation of tax authorities to cancel the VAT registration for payers in the event of repeated non-filing of a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may revoke the registration of the tax payer "ex offo" in cases where: a) the payer has not carried out without notice of the reason to the tax authorities for twelve consecutive months of performance, b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under this Act, c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous control action, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the FA for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration as of 31 December 2004. 1. unsettled payers who have not been obliged to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FÚ did not often cancel the VAT registration for Prague 1, as the relevant provision provided for an insufficient deadline for the cancellation of registration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was eliminated by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2008. They shall forthwith inform the Commission of their view that they shall</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of an unsaved tax payer if the tax payer has not delivered any goods or services subject to vat in the previous calendar year or exempt goods or services entitled to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly reporting of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="135">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for reporting.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the periods for which summary reports on intra-EU performance are reported to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission of their</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">The recapitulative statement must be submitted to the payer even if the services for which the place of performance is determined in accordance with § 9 para. 1 of the VAT Act, granted to another Member State by a taxable person in another Member State and if he is obliged to award and pay the tax to the recipient from those services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of the service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of vat declaration data and summary reports in order to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration compares data on intra-community transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech payers automatically in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper VAT collection is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore an area of priority interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this struggle is demonstrated, inter alia, by the fact that the the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009 in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and actual VAT amounts collected in the 25 EU Member States ('EU-25') during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">On the basis of the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of loss on uncollected VAT for this period is BETWEEN EUR 90 and EUR 113 billion, with an average of 12 % of the eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the framework of international cooperation, it was stated in the previous control action that an effective risk management system could not be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO carried out a eurocanet review for the exchange of information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by EU tax payers included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of combating VAT fraud should also be achieved by establishing a EUROFISC network to improve the cooperation of responsible authorities in a form that enables fraud to be detected already in their germs.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later also become an important source of information in the assessment of risks to intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 December 2005. It shall, at the same time, set out the basic principles to be followed by the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The EUROFISC is already a functioning system for the rapid and selective exchange of eurocanet information developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report produced the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">The conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has established a well-functioning system for the registration of tax payers, which is based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance alerted the Commission to this system in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system is improved on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">At present, the questionnaire data are processed electronically and will then be used for the survey as part of risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission presented a proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed development of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to secure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly reporting of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 June 2005, the Council adopted Decision The law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 15 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="173">This Act contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of summary reports on intra-Community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions took effect on 1 January 2005. They are very, on 17 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of vat declaration data and recapitulative reports in order to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of the interconnection of the two VAT return systems and for summary reports</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group composed of workers from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance has been set up.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the Working Party looked at a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">The sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a participant in this exchange in the context of the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and, on the basis of a written consultation of 18 December 2005, the European Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive on the application of the european union's strategy for the 2 The establishment of the Risk Management Platform was added to the Fiscalis Action Plan 2006-2007.</seg>
<seg id="185">Platform members are further divided into sub-groups dealing with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influencing negotiations, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the beginning of 2010, reports on the results of the activities of these sub-groups were published.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of conditions for VAT registration and the cancellation of VAT in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT payer tax identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issue of registration and registration has so far been left to the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed development of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">THE BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2005, the Council adopted Decision On 16 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached political consensus on that proposal for a regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and are only obliged to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, since both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome the Commission's further efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly reporting of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="201">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of summaries, allowing for a more timely examination of intra-Community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion reduces the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions are reported to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2004. It was published on 1 January 2010. They are very, on 17 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit summary reports monthly according to the specified calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of vat declaration data and recapitulative reports in Germany in order to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of the interconnection of the two VAT return systems and for summary reports</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO has carried out a eurocanet control for the exchange of information in the EU (see chap. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this area, BRH focused on German participation in the so-called "German" movement. risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-Community transaction cases</seg>
<seg id="213">In the previous control action, the execution of commercial transactions, for which there were doubts as to their implementation or irregularities in the way in which payers from both countries reported these business transactions in their VAT returns or summary reports, was examined.</seg>
<seg id="214">Both control institutions selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the control of which was not completed during the previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">Czech payer acquired in 1. goods worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer in the quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods was not accepted by the Czech payer in his VAT return because the German payer was not assigned a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that, under the German VAT Act, the payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for intra-Community supplies of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A subsequent inspection by the SAO found that, on the basis of a check carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return in which he admitted the acquisition of goods at that value and at the same time claimed the same amount in that tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">In the 4th century, the Czech payer had a total of 100,000 people who to purchase goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer in the quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not mention in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax authorities refused cooperation at the request of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, since the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech tax administrator did not obtain the evidence, he terminated the inspection without finding it and the tax liability remained at the original level.</seg>
<seg id="225">The SAO subsequently found that the Czech tax administrator had received from Germany two spontaneous information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in the proper VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>

<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods in question was not accepted by the Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not submitted VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax administrator assessed VAT of CZK 0 for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of the information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, the tax authorities invited the payer to submit an additional VAT return in March 2007, which the payer did not submit.</seg>
<seg id="232">A subsequent inspection revealed that the tax administrator carried out further tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the czech payer had sold the passenger car in question to a car bazaar in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax year, which subsequently assessed VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and its subsequent sale of CZK 295,379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>

<seg id="238">The response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that an unsealed tax-criminal procedure is pending against a German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the subsequent inspection, BRH obtained information that, after the conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was established that the German tax payer had been involved in fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intra-Community acquisitions of goods were taxed at a value of EUR 182 424 (year 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO subsequently found that the Czech payer was involved in carousel shops with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of the information of the German tax administration concerning the screening of supplies of goods, a VAT check was initiated with the Czech tax entity for the tax year April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the control findings and information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the period May 2005 of CZK 703,031 and czk 726,551 for the period June 2005.</seg>

<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine with a total value of EUR 58,000 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was to deliver in the 3rd quarter of 2009. In 2004, the Czech payer B was a machine worth EUR 88 027, but payer B denied this acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="247">Subsequent inspection of the SAO found that payer B acquired the machine from a German company, which had an organizational unit established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer A did not report the acquisition of goods from the German payer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">A reply from the German tax administrator to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intra-Community delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but the supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">The BRH subsequently found that, after the tax check, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified for the supply of the machine in the country and the VAT exemption was abolished.</seg>

<seg id="252">In the 3rd year, the German tax payer had a tax refund. the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 11 600.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO subsequently found that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was unduly indicated, including the acquisition of goods at that value.</seg>
<seg id="255">The BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authorities corrected the German payer's VAT return and subsequently assessed VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The recapitulative statement of the German payer has not yet been corrected because corrections to recapitulative reports in Germany can only be carried out by the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After the tax procedure for the tax year was carried out, the Czech tax administrator charged a tax liability of CZK 0 to the Czech taxpayer and told the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A subsequent inspection of the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administrator sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">By subsequent checks, BRH found that the German payer had changed his registered office and the new locally competent tax administrator had abolished the VAT exemption for the supply of the car in question to the Czech payer on the basis of the check carried out.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German tax payer has not yet corrected the data in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to data from the VIES system, the German payer delivered to the Czech tax payer in the period from 3 January 2004 to 31 December 2006. quarter 2004 to 1 January 2004. total of EUR 33 205 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">A subsequent inspection by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator tried to ascertain the causes of the differences arising from the Czech tax payer in the acquisition of goods in the period from 3 January 2004 to 31 December 2004. quarter 2004 to 1 January 2004 quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the first year in auat.... quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the acquired goods in the amount of CZK 134,273 for the period 3. quarter 2004 to 1 January 2004. In the 2005 quarter of 2005, as according to the czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture commercial transactions for each quarter, and therefore the tax administrator accepted the additional tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the 3rd year of the year, the German tax payer delivered a tax refund. czech payer of EUR 46 854 in the first quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">Over the same period, the Czech payer admitted intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of delivery of goods of EUR 31 998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data given in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Subsequent inspection of the SAO found that the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return for the tax year of July 2004 to January 2007 after many urgencies by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="275">In that tax return, the tax payer also exercised his right to deduct VAT, thus leaving the tax liability unchanged for that tax year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The follow-up check verified that for selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most tax proceedings were completed and that tax authorities in both the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. additional VAT or avoided input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of the inspection in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for the detection of risk entities within the Member State in which the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with the data on the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="281">From 1 January 2005, the In the quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data to EUROCANET on risky transactions and on tax entities acting as suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="282">As part of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in EUROCANET were selected for control.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax authorities from other Member States were captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax authorities did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information to help ascertain whether suppliers with a German VAT ID had been assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The control action revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where applicable, tax authorities have used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">Such as:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax authorities have not detected any suspected involvement in risky transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities shall continuously monitor such tax entities for their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the verification of risk transactions, the tax authorities did not demonstrate in the accounts submitted a derogation from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relationships with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• Verification of business transactions was complicated as some tax payers did not cooperate with tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The local tax authorities mostly examined the risky tax entities and risk transactions referred to in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax authorities in the screening of risky transactions, in particular in connection with the screening of the so-called "tax authorities". missing traders have limited options and only from physical checking of documents makes it difficult to prove to the tax entity fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible registration cancellations would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious deliveries of goods within the EU or for the issue of formally correct tax documents to payers who unduly draw input VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where the involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other fraud is suspected and goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater mutual cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would assist in identifying goods and discrepancies in the transport documentation and in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in eurocanet activities was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of the system, which should be eliminated by the establishment of a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2. Results of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The BRH analysed the information available from the Federal Central Tax Office containing data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">These figures were a criterion for the selection of six files of German tax payers for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is merely the recipient of eurocanet data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:.in the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis to violate the applicable rules on the concealment of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States under EUROCANET.' 17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has analysed eurocanet data and has been conducting it to the tax authorities of the Länder in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">German tax authorities receive control information on the direct trade relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in eurocanet.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationships with traders from other Member States who also maintain business relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is not satisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences with regard to the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to establish a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the EU has reached political agreement on a proposal for a regulation whose main contribution lies in the establishment of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="318">The envisaged network to combat VAT fraud should also include the experience gained in the use of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases brought to the courts at national and European level show that a debate between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions of tax exemptions for intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following directives are a fundamental adjustment of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>

<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the field of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay close attention to keeping their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In its 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of mismatches in statistics decreased even though the number of applications had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important that statistics issues be renegotiated at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the two SAIs agree that reliable statistics are intended to report the annual number of applications as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amounts of claims recovered by each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by The Member States, as this can help Member States assess their own effectiveness in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that the recovery rate can be calculated broken down into individual Member States is considered by the two SAIs to be useful in order for Member States with a lower recovery rate to intensify their efforts and to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery of claims in a timely manner to the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was identified for requests for international assistance received from tax authorities from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of claims, because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months from the date on which the receipt of the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for the control of the VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax year specified in the personal income tax return amounted to EUR 2 billion. CZK or higher.</seg>
<seg id="504">The classification of the tax entity among the VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">The tax entity ceased to be referred to as VDS if, in three consecutive tax years since the end of the period in which it filed its tax return on the basis of which it was classified among the VDS, its net turnover for the tax year has fallen below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">The tax entity could not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax audit of at least one tax for one tax year.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were checked at least five years in the period by the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">From 2010 on, a written assessment of the tax entity must be carried out at least every 2 years and tax risks must be eliminated and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The control of the FE is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator usually chooses several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The VDS were controlled by the departments of specialised controls, which are set up for a total of 13 FA, or by the staff of the control departments of the locally competent FA.</seg>
<seg id="511">The department of specialised controls shall carry out tax checks within the scope of the competence established by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities operating in unusual and specific business fields;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities for which tax audits are extremely difficult to carry out tax checks;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with a branched territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of widespread tax evasion and unauthorised lure of excessive deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax checks carried out by the departments of specialised FA checks and the results of such checks are given in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, which consists of the establishment of a specialised FÚ with national competence for selected tax entities (e.g. for legal entities established for business purposes, which have reached a turnover of more than EUR 2 billion. CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT controls on large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. vat controls in the general market. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • German Fiscal Code (AO), • Fiscal Governance Act (FVG), • tax control regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax on-the-Spot. In particular, those articles lay down the rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot tax control (i.e. on the premises of the undertaking), their scope by subject matter, the rules on the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the control notice, the principles of control, the obligation of the tax body to cooperate and the preconditions for carrying out the final discussion and communication of the control report.</seg>
<seg id="526">Tax checks on the spot are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Administration Act Pursuant to Article 5.1(1) in relation to Article 5.1 of the 2007-2008 Fiscal Code, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5.1, 19 of the Act, participation in on-the-spot tax checks carried out by the tax authorities is mandatory for the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The participating authorities shall agree on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it selects be subject to scrutiny at a time which it designates.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case, it may issue rules on the implementation and content of the inspection at the premises of such companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Rules on tax controls Under Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the rules on tax controls (German acronym BpO 2000) have been approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German Parliament, in which the governments of the Federal States are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative rules apply to on-the-spot checks carried out by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Undertakings shall be classified according to size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large undertakings are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 of the BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">According to Article 33.1 of The BpO 2000, each informed tax authority must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the supplementary methodology for tax administration provides the following guidelines:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Single manual for special VAT controls in Germany ;</seg>
<seg id="539">• the USLO manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of intra-Community trade data conducted in VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">• zauber manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• Work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits depending on the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The data is published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to control - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular control intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually announced including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that, in the course of the inspection, checks will be carried out in particular by income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. vat. control of all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organizational arrangement of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by checks usually ranges between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 foresee a control period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes of the company are subject to the examination.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues in order to gain an overview of how the tax administration manages the issue of VAT controls for VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax authorities on areas they consider essential to the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses relating to VAT control for VDS have at its disposal to manage tax administrations?</seg>
<seg id="558">Especially:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between combating VAT fraud and, in general, VAT control?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such resolution in the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general control of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT controls (in relation to the time period of the transactions checked)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Records of the timeliness of enquiries with relevance for intra-community acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, the information recorded in ADIS also includes data of how long it took to query.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average time of the last check (information on the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the latest tax assessment period; also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, statistics produced at federal level for special VAT control services do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there any statistics or records of the nature of additional tax revenues, broken down e.g. according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. a net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the tax entity wrongly applied a reduced RATE of VAT instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only a nominal increase in the tax liability (e.g. moving a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of the additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the volumes of additional tax charged by type of tax, the number of tax entities audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax practices (local investigations, proceedings) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">The time data and amounts of additional taxes paid shall be recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">General debt statistics broken down by type of tax are also kept, but not by the declared tax or tax determined by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT control services do not distinguish between those criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Furthermore, these differences do not distinguish even the majority of the tax administrations visited.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are the areas of control recorded which generate high additional revenues?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect tax payers for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of the ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT control services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down the increased tax (VAT) liability they measure if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, it must specify e.g. the nature of the tax increase assessed.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- The VDS exercise an unjustified right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to § 72 para. 1 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation pursuant to § 75 para. 3 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements laid down in § 73 para. 1 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to § 21 para. 1 of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It was noted that there were no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT control services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">The findings concerning VAT are not separately registered by the Länder if they result from VDS tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down the increased tax (VAT) obligations assessed by them if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration analyse the areas of control from which the high "yield" results and infer consequences for the management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching national audits on risky commodities or on the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT control services do not provide data on audit areas resulting in high "revenues".</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the analysis process, as well as on case management in terms of materiality.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but their use is on the tax authorities' own account.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a number of data from the tax checks carried out, as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheet and profit and loss accounts.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to direct the selection of risk-prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same is true of the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the Czech Republic plans to establish a specialised tax office for the administration of VDS.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">It follows that it is more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on the selection of individual cases based on data from the tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="612">The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to measure the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce vat gaps.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the vat collection revenue will increase and the level of risk detection among unreliable entrepreneurs will also be improved.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two SAIs on parallel controls of VAT management met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">The two SAIs have better understood each other's systems in the following areas: • intra-community transactions, • VAT risk management, in particular as regards the selection of risk-prone transactions, • assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT control for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in strategies for detecting VAT fraud cases as well as differences in the above areas of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany have been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and best practices were identified on the basis of them.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, the two SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to start a debate on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
