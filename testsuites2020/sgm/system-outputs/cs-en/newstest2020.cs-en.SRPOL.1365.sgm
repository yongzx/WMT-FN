<seg id="1">Report on the results of parallel inspections of the administration of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted material informs on the course and results of parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax administration and the use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) information system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so revenues from value added tax affect not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel auditing activities were mainly aimed at controlling the procedure of tax administrators when scrutinizing the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions carried out between individual Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of VIES has enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in the various Member States of the European Union and on the commercial transactions carried out by those payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the data in the VIES system and the data in the VAT return filed by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and enable the detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit of the parallel checks carried out consisted not only in the exchange of information on the procedures of the tax or tax authorities for administering value added tax, but in particular in the examination of the use of the VIES system in monitoring the exercise of the right to exemption from value added tax in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained during the implementation of parallel controls is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of other parallel controls in cooperation with the audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel inspections of the administration of value added tax for the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6th 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) closed on 12. 9th 2005 Agreement on cooperation in control activities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel auditing actions - Administration of Value Added Tax - included in the 2005 Audit Plan of the SAO, the Czech Republic under No. 05/19 and - Audit of the procedures of tax authorities in the administration, control and recovery of taxes from the added value and the fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between the member countries of the SAO - included in the Audit Plan of the SAO of the Slovak Republic under No. 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel control actions carried out were coordinated controls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated inspection was processed in accordance with European Enforcement Regulation 31 for INTOSAI inspection standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted in exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract concluded and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated audit was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious business transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "CR") and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SR").</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties contractually agreed to provide each other with information from public sources, from the electronic system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 financial authorities: the Financial Authority in Mladá Boleslav, the Financial Authority in Kolín, the Financial Authority in Teplice, the Financial Authority in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Authority in Tábor, the Financial Authority Brno III, the Financial Authority in Znojmo, the Financial Authority in Zlín, the Financial Authority in Šumperk, the Financial Authority Ostrava I, the Financial Authority for Prague 7 and the Financial Authority for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the Exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: Tax Office Bratislava I, Tax Office Komárno, Tax Office Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Office Zvolen, Tax Office Dolný Kubín, Tax Office Košice II, Tax Office Košice V and Tax Office Michalovce.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of inspections:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel auditing actions was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in administering value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "EU") and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, especially when controlling the application of the VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited period of the coordinated audit covered the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6th 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions The electronic VIES system is in place in the EU Member States, which allows tax administrations to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT, and in the country of destination to check whether the customer has properly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit revealed differences in national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The recapitulative statements indicate the values of deliveries of goods to other EU Member States; the values of services rendered are not included in the recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, data from summary reports submitted by Czech payers are processed at the level of tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States stated in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">Financial authorities transmit data from recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the Slovak Republic, data from summary reports filed by Slovak taxpayers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and the value of supplies of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT tax returns, which makes it possible to compare the values stated in summary returns with the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and to identify any differences between them.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the values of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on a common line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, in the Slovak Republic, the system does not allow for automatic identification of differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT tax returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the values of supplies of goods in VAT returns makes it possible to use the results of data comparisons to control the VAT exemption of supplies of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">Delivered data from summary reports filed by payers in other EU Member States are processed on the CLO and compared with the value of acquisition of goods stated by payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the Slovak Republic, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax administrators themselves decide which cases of differences to check.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of supplies and acquisitions of goods must be verified by the tax administrators and submits a list of these cases to the locally competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that, for the most significant deviations, it is verified whether the VAT on the acquisition of the goods has been declared correctly.</seg>
<seg id="43">The audit also highlighted some problems in the VAT administration system complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">In the EU, recapitulative statements are submitted for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">The reduction of the period covered by recapitulative statements to one month, together with the reduction of the processing period, would allow earlier access to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">This would allow tax administrations to check more effectively whether VAT on intra-Community acquisitions has been declared in the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, filing VAT returns and recapitulative returns for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer declared identical values of supplies of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative return and the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="48">Differences between the values of deliveries of goods reported by EU payers and the values of acquisitions of goods reported by payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia were caused, among other things, by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in summary reports or the reporting of intra-Community supplies in the supplier's summary report in a different quarter than intra-Community acquisitions in the purchaser's VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="50">Harmonising the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the tax administrations of individual Member States more effective.</seg>
<seg id="51">Cooperation between the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also aimed at examining selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicions of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic found the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax subjects have declared in their VAT returns for the purpose of unduly obtaining excess VAT the carrying out of intra-Community transactions which have not actually taken place;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax subjects declared intra-Community supplies in carousel transactions where the value of supplies was deliberately reduced several times in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers declared in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">suppliers have made intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to taxable persons who have not been registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than that declared by the purchasers of intra-Community acquisitions, in some cases VAT was declared at an incorrect amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">The findings of the audit showed that VIES provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrations should pay particular attention to the rigorous examination of the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES data and to the use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="62">The issue of value added tax after the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1. 5. In 2004, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became members of the EU.</seg>

<seg id="68">In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the delivery of goods in the Czech Republic means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">A supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is a supply of goods that have actually been dispatched or transported to another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="70">According to the provisions of Section 64 of Act No.235/2004 Coll., it is an exempt taxable supply with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are delivered to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">In accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., the supply of tangible property in which the right of ownership is changed is considered a supply of goods in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="72">The transfer of goods which are in the possession of the taxable person from the territory of the country to another Member State shall also be regarded as a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under Article 43 of Law No 222/2004 Coll., the supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the customer is a person identified for VAT purposes in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="74">According to the provisions of Section 16 of Act No.235/2004 Coll., the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods that are dispatched or transported to the customer by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>

<seg id="76">In accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., the acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic from another EU Member State means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property sent or transported to the purchaser by the supplier or purchaser or on their behalf to the Czech Republic from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">Tax liability in the Slovak Republic arises for the payer when acquiring goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State pursuant to the provisions of Section 20 of Act No.222/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="78">Under the provisions of Section 49 of Act No 222/2004 Coll., the payer may deduct VAT if the tax is applied by him on the acquisition of goods within the country from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of Sections 11 and 11a of this Act.</seg>

<seg id="80">Intra-Community transactions are supplies and acquisitions of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="82">VIES system</seg>
<seg id="83">In order to monitor the application of the right to VAT exemption on intra-Community supplies of goods, a VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows the tax authorities of the EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable supply from VAT and, conversely, whether the purchaser duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State is developing its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">National systems operate on a common principle and are interconnected through the EU's common communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was connected to the automated tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "ADIS") and in Slovakia to the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "APV DIS").</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by the tax or tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and duties.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU Member State obtains information on tax subjects that it would not have been able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is the fight against tax evasion and tax losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State shall establish a central unit within the internal organisational structure in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the administration of VAT, the so-called "central unit." CLO (Central Liaison Office).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the tasks arising from international cooperation are performed by the Ministry of Finance - the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (hereinafter referred to as MF CLO) was established.</seg>
<seg id="95">The function of the CLO in the Slovak Republic is performed by the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic, Department of International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as "DR CLO").</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments, among other things, communicate with EU foreign administrations in particular in the field of information exchange within the VIES system, exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, verification of tax identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as VAT numbers) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communication with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to examine a certain intra-Community transaction or to obtain other information relating to a particular tax entity, the tax authorities send requests for information to the EU through the MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use to determine VAT correctly.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information are sent mostly in electronic form between the Customs of the EU Member States, using a standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was focused mainly on the examination of selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two countries and on the level of use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">The SAO, the Czech Republic required the SAO of the Slovak Republic to examine in 30 cases commercial transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">In 10 cases, the SAO requested the SAO to scrutinize commercial transactions between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">Examination of intra-community transactions revealed, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO of the Czech Republic asked the SAO of the Slovak Republic to examine the procedure of the tax administrator to which the reply to the request for information was sent.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak tax office applied through the SCAC form for verification of the delivery of the goods (footwear) at 3. quarter 2004 from the Slovak payer in the value of 2 847 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="108">The Financial Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer stated the acquisition of goods in this value only in the additional VAT tax return and delivered the same goods back to Slovak tax entities in the value of CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">On the basis of international cooperation between the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the locally competent tax authority fully acknowledged the Slovak supplier's right to an excessive deduction of VAT arising, among other things, from this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">This tax office did not provide information about the suspected re-export to the tax authorities of the locally competent purchasers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">This will trigger further examination of business activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC form to examine the supply of a technological line to Slovakia worth CZK 4,850 thousand in 2. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax proceedings carried out in Slovakia showed that only part of the technological line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395 thousand were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">During the examination of this case, the SAO SR found that VAT on the taxable supply was declared by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850 thousand in the VAT return (hereinafter referred to as "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO, CR also found that the Czech payer reported in its DAP an excessive VAT deduction in the amount of CZK 655,000 for the quarter, which was incurred by applying a VAT deduction from the purchase of this technological line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">On the basis of the results of the investigation, the Czech Financial Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax subjects had established a business relationship for the purpose of unduly obtaining an excess VAT deduction, disputed the taxable performance and did not grant the Czech payer a part of the tax deduction entitlement in the amount of CZK 647,000.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">In 2004, the Slovak tax administrator applied through the SCAC form for an examination of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer in the value of SKK 24,246,000 made in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">These goods were purchased by the Slovak payer in November 2002 in Slovakia from another tax entity worth 29,667,000 Sk and subsequently sold to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity applied an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="122">In a tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and DAP for 4. did not file for the quarter of 2002 or thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO SR found that the Slovak tax administrator, on the basis of the results of the tax audit, did not recognise the right to an excess deduction in the amount of SKK 5,541 thousand applied in the DAP for the month of 11/2002 and set the tax liability at SKK 1,750 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, that taxable person was not granted an exemption from VAT in respect of the export of the goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the acquired goods for 3. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to purchase from Slovakia goods (diluent) worth 3,767,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax subject did not cooperate with the tax administrator, did not file a DAP and was charged ex officio VAT of CZK 0 for the months 7 to 12/2004.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC form to verify whether deliveries of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic took place, in what amount and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In reply, the Slovak Tax Office sent a copy of the invoice, the bills of lading and the demand for payment of the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with the right to deduct VAT for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, CR found that the Czech tax administrator evaluated the response to the request for information delivered from Slovakia as evidence that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the basis of further investigation, the Financial Office in the Czech Republic will ask the superior authority to review the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (particle board products) inter alia to an American company which stored these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone of customs.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of that free zone was indicated on the invoices as the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, for example, an American company purchased particleboard tiles worth USD 57 600 (at a unit price of USD 100 per piece) from a Slovak payer and placed them in a free zone of customs.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred ownership of the goods to a Swiss company, with a value of USD 14 400 (unit price of USD 25 per piece), and the goods were exported back to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the area of the free zone on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax authority initiated tax inspections of individual tax periods in 2004 and 2005 at the supplier of goods suspected of carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="141">Examination of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech locally competent tax authorities via several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">The individual answers gradually created a picture of the trades and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from Slovakia and the Czech Republic in carousel trades.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO and the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO of the Slovak Republic, found that in these business relations there was a deliberately severalfold decrease in the value of goods.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the information obtained, the Tax Directorate of Slovakia concluded that the carousel trade in this case is free pricing (i.e. import of undervalued goods and their overvaluation by domestic companies that are in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a violation of the VAT Act in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="145">Under the current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be prevented as they fulfil all the conditions of the VAT exemption law.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">The Czech payer was 12. 7th 2005 VAT registration cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="148">On the 27th. 10 a.m. In 2005, on the basis of a voluntarily submitted application for VAT registration, this entity became a tax payer again.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Czech tax entity entered in the DAP for the month of 8/2005 (i.e. the period when it was not a VAT payer) the value of the acquisition of goods (printing press) from Slovakia in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and exercised the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to the delivery of goods from the Slovak payer in the amount of 1,530,000 Sk, which the Slovak payer stated in the DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax authority requested verification of that supply by means of a SCAC form because the Slovak supplier had not proved how he had acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech payer does not cooperate with the tax administrator and is not registered at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax administrator in order to verify the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer said in the summary report for 3. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth 956 thousand Sk to a tax entity from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">The VAT number of the Czech entity was identified by the VIES system as incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="157">Verification in the payer database revealed that such a TIN has never been allocated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it concerned the execution of electrical installation works on real estate in the Czech Republic, not the delivery of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax authorities requested verification of these facts by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, the Czech Republic inquired with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the tax subject listed on the invoices as a customer had never been registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not declare the tax on received services from the Slovak entity and did not declare the tax on acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">No local investigation or tax inspection was carried out at the Czech entity, its current residence is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity had become a VAT payer by virtue of its acceptance of the service.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak tax entity will be tax audited for 1 to 4. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">The Slovak payer said in the summary report for 3. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth 1,055 thousand Sk to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it concerned the execution of electrical installation works on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">It was not a delivery of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but a provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax authorities requested verification of these facts by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, Czech Republic enquired with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the supply and in order to examine the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States at 3. In the quarter of 2004, an on-the-spot investigation was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of this on-the-spot investigation, it was found that the present case did not indeed concern the acquisition of goods, but the acquisition of services, which were also reported by the Czech entity in the regular DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">The Financial Office also found that the Czech entity did not pay 3 for the tax period as a result of the wrong VAT calculation procedure. 2004 quarter VAT in the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tax subject submits an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">When asked by the local tax office, the SAO SR found that the Slovak payer had incorrectly stated the provision of the service in the summary report and would be subject to a tax audit for 1 to 4. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech tax entity voluntarily registered as a VAT payer from 10. 3rd 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For 1. quarter 2004 filed DAP with a high turnover in both input and output.</seg>
<seg id="178">The locally competent tax administrator initiated tax proceedings, the subject did not cooperate with the tax administrator, therefore due to the suspicion of involvement in carousel trade, he was charged VAT in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="179">This payer has not filed another DAP.</seg>
<seg id="180">On the grounds of non-compliance with his obligations under the law, his VAT registration was cancelled as of 4 April 2004. 1st 2005.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to data from the VIES system, this entity should have acquired from the Slovak payer in 3 and 4. quarter 2004 goods worth 7 846 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the realisation of those transactions, the Czech tax authorities sent two requests for information to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="183">In an inquiry to the local tax office, the SAO SR found that the manager of the Czech company denied the execution of the transactions and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">On the basis of the tax proceedings carried out in Slovakia, the intra-Community supply to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be recognised as entitled to VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer should have purchased at 1. quarter 2005 from Slovak goods (work clothes) in the total value of 39 970 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="188">In this quarter, the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only in DAP for the month of 3/2005, in the value of CZK 11,292,000.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax authority carried out an on-the-spot investigation of the entity in order to verify the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">Since the company did not provide any documents or otherwise prove that the taxable transactions had taken place, he assessed it on 9. 6th 2005 VAT administrator in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to doubts about the realisation of the acquisition of the goods, the tax administrator sent two requests for information to Slovakia in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the response to the requests for information, the tax administrator in Slovakia had doubts about the implementation of business cases as well as about the implementation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the premises of the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated audit, the locally competent tax administrator carried out further investigations concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic and an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was carried out at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of involvement in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions with goods (work clothes) were carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia at 4. 2004 quarter and 1. 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak payer No. 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No. 3, who delivered them back to payer No. 4 (see diagram No. 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">(A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech payer No. 2 was to acquire from Slovak payer No. 1 at 4. 2004 quarter goods (work clothes) worth 4 847 thousand CZK and 1. quarter 2005 goods worth CZK 17,050,000.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the locally competent tax administrator sent the taxes to Slovakia on 25. 5. 2005 request for information.</seg>
<seg id="203">In reply, the Slovak tax authority expressed doubts about the implementation of the business cases and about the implementation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8. 6th 2005, a request for information was delivered to the Ministry of Finance (MF CLO) from Slovakia concerning goods worth 16,575,000 Sk, which were to be delivered by Slovak payer No. 1 to Czech payer No. 2 in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side demanded to verify whether Czech payer No 2 had actually received the goods, declared them in the DAP and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">The official record prepared by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that Czech payer No.2 has not been registered at the address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax year, he filed the DAP for a quarterly tax year.</seg>
<seg id="208">In view of this, the Czech tax authorities could not charge VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The realisation of the taxable supply between the Slovak payer No. 1 and the Czech payer No. 2 stated in the application in the amount of 16,575,000 Sk could not be verified due to the above mentioned facts.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel business in order to draw an excess VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="211">(B)</seg>
<seg id="212">Czech payer No. 3, engaged in the purchase and sale of passenger cars, submitted DAPs for the tax period of months 1 and 2/2005, in which he declared the delivery of goods (work clothes) to Slovak payer No. 4 with a total value of CZK 21,935,000.</seg>
<seg id="213">These work clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No.3 from Czech payer No.2 between December 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic, the object of which was mainly to verify whether Slovak payer No.4 had acquired goods worth CZK 1,025 thousand from Czech payer No.3 in December 2004 and at 1. quarter 2005 in the value of 21 935 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="215">The response to this request for information received from Slovakia showed that in the DAP for the month of 12/2004 Slovak payer No.4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for the months 1 and 2/2005 the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only amounted to 1,193 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="216">Slovak tax payer No 4 did not respond to the request to submit tax documents for the tax period from 10/2004 to 3/2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The on-the-spot investigation carried out in Slovakia revealed that the company was not located at the registered address.</seg>
<seg id="218">The response also stated that this payer meets all the characteristics of the so-called "lost society" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the premises of the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax authority collected documents which would confirm or deny the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be assessed according to the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Czech Police are also investigating the case.</seg>
<seg id="223">Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of parallel auditing events, a coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO SR took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants of this meeting got acquainted with the VAT legislation in both countries and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The outcome of the meeting was the specification of the scope of cooperation and the determination of the conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: a) verification of the validity and correctness of VAT registration numbers of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic or Slovakia in intra-Community supplies; b) verification of data on intra-Community acquisitions listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of payers from Slovakia contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia on business transactions carried out.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax subjects for inspection will be carried out in relation to the volume of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and Slovakia via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The following diagram shows the procedure of information processing by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia during intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intra-Community supply</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he is obliged to file the SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic provides summary information on supplies of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT in the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in the Slovak Republic is obliged to state the value of goods that have been exempted from tax and delivered from the Czech Republic to other EU Member States during the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">The information on the value of the delivered goods is always given in the SH in Czech or Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities, stating their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Service data shall not be included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has entered incorrect data in the SH, he is obliged to file a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">In the event that the payer in the SR finds that the data provided in the SH were incomplete or incorrect, he submits a correction to the SH before the expiry of the deadline for filing the SH, after which he is obliged to file an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">VIES allows the exchange of information on VAT-registered payers" registration data in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can check whether the VAT number of the respective purchaser is registered in the given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">The data from the submitted SH are grouped on the MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual DIČ of the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The aggregate value of all deliveries for each purchaser's VAT number and the code of the method of performance from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, are created.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-community benefits between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from L1QD files) is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If VIES in another Member State detects an erroneous originator's TIN in the sent L1QD files, it generates an O_MCTL message containing all erroneous TINs indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is then sent to MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL message may contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect TIN, TIN is not registered in the given state or has never been allocated, the customer with a certain TIN was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, VAT registration of the customer was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, the MF CLO transmits data from the received O_MCTL messages to the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the wrong VAT number of a payer from the EU is used in one of the sent SH lines or subsequent SH lines, the so-called "Notification of doubts about VAT ID" is generated at the relevant tax office by the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office will check whether the supply to a VAT-registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In SR, the DR CLO processes all O_MCTL messages in the VIES system and sends them electronically to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of the taxpayers who have entered the wrong TIN in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">Subsequently, the tax authorities invite the payer to submit an additional SH and provide valid VAT numbers, or the tax office will verify the delivery of goods to the respective payer when reporting an invalid VAT number in the submitted SH.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of erroneous VAT numbers relating to intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Of the total number of 41 728 VAT numbers of Czech payers listed in the Slovak payers" SH in the period from 2. quarter 2004 to 1. In the 2005 quarter, there were 929 erroneous TINs, i.e. 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number of 62 997 Slovak payers" VAT numbers listed in the SH of Czech payers in the same period, 416 were incorrect VAT numbers, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-Community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="257">During the examination of the activities of the tax and tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although at the request of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity at 4. The O_MCTL message was subsequently generated due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation revealed that the termination of the marketing authorisation did not take place until Day 1. 1st 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO SR also found that 6 tax subjects filed SHs in which the incorrect TIN was stated, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain these TINs.</seg>
<seg id="262">In Slovakia, the submitted SH is transferred to the tax authorities in electronic form and the data from it is sent to the DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">After subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the DR CLO sends to the relevant tax authorities so-called breakdowns of errors in the SH filed by tax entities for the respective quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH to 26. 7th 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and at 2. 2nd 2006 (i.e. data processed after completion of the inspection).</seg>
<seg id="265">The following table provides a comparison of the data.</seg>
<seg id="266">It can be seen from the above data that the SAO SR audit had an impact not only on the decrease in the number of SHs with erroneous TIN (on average by 199 SHs per quarter), but also on the decrease in the number of uncorrected errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-community supplies stated by the payer in the respective DAP lines is compared with the value of intra-community supplies stated by the payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">ADIS automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should check the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the obtained data when determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO of the Czech Republic found that the audited financial authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">In these cases, the total difference between the values stated in the SH and DAP amounted to CZK 537,231,000.</seg>
<seg id="272">From 3. In the quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values stated in the SH and DAP in the amount of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-Community supplies according to the SH as a match and to set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">In the case of payers with a large volume of intra-Community supplies per quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a not insignificant amount, therefore the tax administrators should not set the correspondence of SH and DAP in these cases without clarifying the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, the tax administrator set a consensus in case of a value difference of CZK 1,561,000 without verification.</seg>
<seg id="275">Examination of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH for each calendar quarter was filed by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">In the case of payers with a monthly tax period at the time of filing the DAP for the first two months of the calendar quarter, the tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-Community supplies specified in these DAPs with the values according to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax administrators became aware of any discrepancy between the data in the DAP and the SH only at the time when the tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was assessed, or. returned.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, delivered data from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) are processed by the MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, the data are converted with the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the respective period and then compared with the value of the acquisition stated by the Czech payers in the DAP for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the acquisition of goods reported by the payer in the DAP should be between the minimum and maximum converted value of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in the DAP is lower than the L1min value, an authentication command is generated for payers with the most significant discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax subjects and are handed over to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders concerning audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that in 33 cases the audited financial authorities did not examine discrepancies in the values of intra-community acquisitions referred to in the delivered verification orders.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the values stated in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases was at least CZK 148,319,000.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, the Czech Republic selected for audit 533 files of tax entities, for which the audited financial authorities received an order for verification from the Ministry of Finance CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The audit found the following most common causes of differences between the values stated in the DAP of the purchaser and in the SH of the supplier: on the side of the purchaser (Czech payer) in 263 cases the purchaser did not indicate the acquisition of goods in the regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer declared the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than in which he was obliged to declare the tax, in 6 cases the purchaser stated the value of the goods in the wrong DAP line, on the side of the supplier (payer, from the EU) in 88 cases the payers from the EU entered the value of the Czech goods into their SH in other cases. 5. 2004, in 5 cases suppliers included in the SH the value of advances received.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the part of payers from the Slovak Republic, the erroneous inclusion of the value of services provided in the SS occurred most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were found at audited financial offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, during the investigation of the verification order, it was found that the difference worth CZK 10,974,000 arose from the fact that the Slovak payer entered the SH for 1. quarter 2005 provision of services (construction works and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of received advances in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers reported received advances from Czech payers in the SH, as a result of which an order to verify the difference in the amount of CZK 3,580,000 was generated.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to verify the goods acquired are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where the data from the SH subsequently changes in the EU Member States, such as a change in the purchaser of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES system does not automatically warn of these changes, the locally competent tax administrator of the person acquiring the goods may not, without any other incentive, become aware of the relevant facts for the correct determination of the tax liability of the acquired goods and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">The SAO audit of the Czech Republic revealed that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer said in SH for 2. the value of the delivery of goods for the Czech payer in the amount of 1,504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1. 2nd In 2005, the local tax office sent a request for information to the Czech payer in Slovakia because the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of goods in the amount of CZK 425,000 only.</seg>
<seg id="301">As a result of the tax proceedings, the Slovak payer filed on 1. 3rd 2005 additional SH, in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand Sk and by increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from 194 thousand Sk to the value of 1,160 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers said in their SH for 2. quarter 2004 intra-community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic in the total amount of 10 240 thousand Sk (i.e. CZK 8,183 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech purchasers did not report intra-community acquisitions in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of an international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer who was not mentioned in the SH filed by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">Over the course of 1. quarter 2005 increased Slovak payers in additional SH concerning 2. the value of intra-community supplies for this Czech payer by a total of 10 240 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for 2. quarter 2004, even though the actual purchaser failed to comply with the obligation to declare an intra-Community acquisition for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, CR found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the above-mentioned Czech payer was additionally charged VAT for the tax periods 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640,000 and 3. quarter 2004 in the amount of 3 305 thousand CZK from the acquired goods in these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">It is clear from the above that tax administrations had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences caused by errors in the DAP of the purchaser, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">Unification of the conditions for reporting these data would lead to more effective control activities of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="311">In SR, the APV DIS system makes it possible to compare the data on the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU Member States with the data entered in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which the data is compared is called the "MIN-MAX method".</seg>
<seg id="313">This method is used to convert the values of the delivery of goods shown in the SH of payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">A MIN-MAX interval is created, which is used for comparison with the acquisition values given in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CLO sends the tax administrators information on the values of intra-Community acquisitions specified in the DAP and the values of supplies from the EU in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator will decide for which persons registered for VAT the difference will be checked, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of the data provided by DR CLO, the SAO selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for audit at the audited tax offices, of which 25 payers purchased goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in the DAP were found.</seg>
<seg id="318">The audit carried out by the SAO SR confirmed the fact that the tax administrators did not thoroughly verify the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the correctness of the data contained in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations of specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic at tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies, where the VIES system showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States, the following facts were found:</seg>
<seg id="322">At the DAP in 4. 2004 quarter, the Slovak payer did not state the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that a company from the Czech Republic reported 4. quarter 2004 by mistake the VAT number of this payer, while the goods worth CZK 19,184,000 were actually delivered to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, the Slovak company had 4. quarter 2004 to acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the value of MIN 682 692 thousand Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company submitted DAP for the given periods in which it stated the value of acquisitions of goods from the EU of only 480 599 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation and found that the tax subject purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and DAP did not indicate intra-Community deliveries according to the date of issue of the invoices, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">Due to further irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax administrator will ask for the value of the delivered goods to be checked by means of SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">Acquisition of goods from EU Member States at 4. quarter 2004 the Slovak payer did not mention in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this payer should have purchased goods with a value of MIN 11 286 thousand Sk and MAX 11 845 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax subject at 4. did not procure any goods from EU Member States in the quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO recommended the tax office to request verification of the delivery of goods from EU Member States using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">The VIES system reported the delivery of goods for the Slovak customer in the value of MIN 557 thousand Sk and MAX 565 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the DAP for the tax period from 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not declare any acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax subject received on 10. 12. 2004 from a supplier from the Czech Republic invoice for materials consumed during the repair of a hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO recommended a tax audit of the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the audit of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO asked tax administrators to carry out a tax audit of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections shall be submitted by the tax authorities to the SAO SR after they have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="340">Examples were:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak purchaser did not indicate in the DAP for 4. quarter 2004 acquisition of goods from EU member states and did not declare any tax for the tax period 10 to 12/2004 and claimed a refund of excess VAT deduction in the total amount of 1,236 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax subject acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth EUR 683,000 (approximately SKK 27,080,000).</seg>
<seg id="343">These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Slovak payer issued an invoice for EUR 683 thousand for customers in the Russian Federation, which he did not mention in the submitted DAP.</seg>
<seg id="345">The tax administrator carries out a tax inspection of the tax subject.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the acquisition data shown in the Slovak payer's DAP for 3. quarter 2004 to 1. The total amount of deliveries reported by payers from EU Member States in individual quarters was 4 800 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the tax subject purchased goods from suppliers from the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold these goods to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by single export declarations.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of the goods in the DAP was not stated by the tax subject, according to the statement of the company's manager, the goods in transit were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The tax subject did not submit any VAT records during the on-the-spot investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">A tax audit has been initiated on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International information exchange L3</seg>
<seg id="353">The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by locally competent tax administrators, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "ŽOI') or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as "SPI') relating to a particular tax entity or transaction via the MF CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="354">DR CLO to another EU Member State. The aim of the LI is, for example, to prove the implementation of a given transaction within the framework of intra-Community performance, to verify a certain VAT number, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of SPI, it is a communication of information important for tax administrators in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for replying to the RES was set out in Art. 8 of this Regulation for 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions governing the admissibility of applications are laid down in Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15. 11th 2004, which stipulates that, unless otherwise agreed by the Participating States, the SPA must cover commercial transactions of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">Where the BOI relates to a commercial transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to reply in view of its workload.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure of the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of internal time limits set for processing at individual organizational levels, illustrates the following scheme.</seg>
<seg id="361">In Slovakia, the deadline for the processing of the LI by the tax authorities was set at 2 months so that the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 could be met.</seg>
<seg id="362">MF CLO received from the Slovak Republic from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6th 2005 a total of 29 ZOIs and 3 SPIs.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 RES received, 26 (i.e. 89,7 %) dealt with within the deadline of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were discharged after this deadline.</seg>
<seg id="364">In the same period received DR CLO from the Czech Republic a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 RES received, 64 (i.e. 90,1%) completed within the deadline of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were dealt with after this deadline (for the other 2 cases it was not possible to determine the processing deadline from the materials transmitted).</seg>
<seg id="366">The following graph contains more detailed data on the time of processing of LIs received by MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="367">The following table contains the reasons for sending the RES, as set out on the SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and the use of the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States were examined, especially when controlling the exercise of the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intra-Community transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="371">Examination of selected transactions revealed that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries detected cases of companies carrying out fictitious intra-Community commercial transactions in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions, as well as cases where purchasers did not declare VAT on the correct amount of goods received.</seg>
<seg id="372">The audit also revealed differences in the processing and use of VIES data by tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also pointed to problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">Harmonising the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the tax administrations of individual Member States more effective.</seg>
<seg id="375">An examination of the procedures of the tax or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system revealed that the tax or tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="376">Furthermore, it was found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information in all cases on the supply of goods and on the validity of VAT registration of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SA, processed before the start of the audit, with data processed after completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="378">It was clear from the comparison of these data that the SAO SR audit had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with incorrectly stated VAT numbers, but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In case of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such a possibility under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The findings of the audit showed that VIES provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Given that there is still scope for tax evasion in this area, increased attention needs to be paid to intra-Community transactions when administering VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material provides an overview of the course and results of parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which focused on the area of value added tax and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the SAIs of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement on control activities concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel control actions was chosen with regard to the fact that indirect taxes significantly contribute to the revenues of the state budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The structure of value added tax, which allows the refund of excess deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise duties, in particular on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation through the illegal sale of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively throughout the European Union, the VAT Working Group was created by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, in whose activities the supreme audit authorities of both countries are actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The acquired experience and knowledge will be used in the planned inspections of indirect taxes, aimed primarily at the involvement of the tax administrations of both countries in the VIES system, which allows the control of the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the audit of the administration of value added tax and excise duties for the years 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1st Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Inspection number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Control of the tax administrator's procedure for administering, controlling and enforcing value added tax and excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="18">On 11.2. 2004 The Agreement on Cooperation in Audit Activities between the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO SR) was concluded. The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel auditing operations "Value Added Tax and Excise Tax," included in the 2004 Audit Plan of the SAO under No. 04/07 and "Inspection of the Administrator's Procedure in Administration, Control and Recovery of Taxes from Added Value and Consumption Taxes," included in the Audit Plan of the SAO of the Slovak Republic under No. 18/2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract concluded and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the contract, both parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from the files of tax entities maintained by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the parties could not obtain when controlling the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the respective State.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were carried out in parallel from January to August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of South Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected financial authorities: Financial Authority for Prague 1, Financial Authority for Prague 3, Financial Authority in České Budějovice, Financial Authority in Frýdek-Místek, Financial Authority in Hodonín, Financial Authority in Jihlava, Financial Authority in Kostelec nad Orlicí, Financial Authority in Kroměříž, Financial Authority in Písek, Financial Authority in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Financial Authority in Ústí nad Orlicí, Financial Authority in Velké Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SR") was carried out by the Section of Tax and Customs Administration of the SAO SR in cooperation with the Expositions of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">Tax Office Bratislava before selected tax entities, Tax Office Bratislava III, Tax Office Trnava, Tax Office Pú-chov, Tax Office Banská Bystrica I, Tax Office Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Office Žilina I, Tax Office Žilina II, Tax Office Košice I and Tax Office Košice IV.</seg>
<seg id="26">Objective of control</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the auditing activities was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of financial or tax authorities and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise taxes with a focus on the collection of these taxes in the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of the international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the relevant financial or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2nd Recap of control results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">Within the framework of international cooperation, the SAO handed over 22,206 items of the Uniform Declarations on Imports and Exports of Goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, while the SAO handed over 30,221 items of the JCD from the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison of selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was performed.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of the 5,883 selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 12 343 selected JCD entries from the SR Customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were attributed.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the basis of the unassigned items of the JCD, a selection of files of tax entities was carried out at the tax or tax authorities, where the reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the financial or tax authorities, the implementation of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the territory of the other state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO of Slovakia carried out a joint pilot inspection at the Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma border crossing, during which both parties cooperated closely in verifying the correctness of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not detect any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both countries and highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="42">In the area of international cooperation, the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic focused on imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, or other goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of an audit of the files of tax entities at selected tax or tax authorities, the SAO requested verification of the implementation of exports of goods declared for 40 JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 15,301,093 and the SAO requested verification of exports with a statistical value of CZK 56,989.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic found the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="45">- trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic,</seg>
<seg id="46">- errors in data entry in customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports/exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- for some exports from the Czech Republic, there was no evidence of corresponding imports to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="48">In such cases, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming deductions of value added tax,</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax entities failed to comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="50">- Weaknesses have been identified in the activities of the tax authorities in administering value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of value added tax and excise duties, attention will continue to be paid to international trade in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrators when administering value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">Effective control of excise duties is based on control of the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information during import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3rd Description of the situation in the field of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax ("VAT") was levied by the tax or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out within the country and by the customs authorities on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">Tax revenues were determined at the tax or tax authorities by the difference between the collected own tax liability and the refunded excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="58">The VAT revenue at the customs offices was determined by the amount of tax collected by them.</seg>
<seg id="59">In accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, the tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the tax deductions applied to the tax or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most tax authorities, the excess VAT deductions exceeded the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the key taxes in terms of state budget revenues, as it accounted for approximately 31% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and approximately 42% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Total VAT collection in the Czech Republic reached CZK 162.9 billion in 2003. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2003, the tax and customs authorities collected a total of EUR 394.3 billion in VAT. CZK and refunded excess VAT deductions totalled CZK 231.4 billion. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="64">Total VAT collection in Slovakia amounted to EUR 83.8 billion in 2003. The Sk.</seg>
<seg id="65">In 2003, the tax and customs authorities collected EUR 187.0 billion in VAT. Sk and refunded excess VAT deductions totalled CZK 103.2 billion The Sk.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise duties</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as "SpD") was carried out by the relevant tax or tax authorities and, when importing products subject to the SpD, by customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="68">The share of SpD in tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic was approximately 16% in 2003 and approximately 19% in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total collection of SpD collected in the Czech Republic by the financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to CZK 85.6 billion. CZK and reached CZK 38.0 billion in Slovakia. The Sk.</seg>
<seg id="70">4th Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage, a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out; in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used in the mutual verification of the implementation of selected trade transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and in inspections carried out on the territory of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel audits of VAT and SpD was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, a coordination meeting took place at which, inter alia, a selection of commodities was agreed - types of goods which posed a significant risk in complying with customs and tax legislation: - alcohol and spirits, tariff headings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out: a) from unassigned items determined by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, b) from entities carrying out imports and exports on a regular or one-off basis in large volumes, c) on the basis of findings from inspections carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, the mechanism of mutual allocation of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, the part of exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports to Slovakia in 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatured, of any strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol. ; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco refuse,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other manufactured tobacco and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences,</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus:</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus:</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">JCD items from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were mutually assigned on the basis of the conformity of individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle transporting freight, date of crossing the state border, customs tariff item, etc.). ).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are shown in the following tables and charts.</seg>
<seg id="92">The mutual allocation of individual imports and exports was hampered, among other things, by the fact that trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic, declared on one export JCD, were declared on the territory of the Slovak Republic on several import JCDs, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that influenced the success of the assignment were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at audited financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, for the verification of business transactions reported in the VAT tax returns, some tax entities were selected for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot inspection at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing for the performance of pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="100">On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the use of checklists has been introduced at border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and Slovakia since 1 June 1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate, as far as possible, customs and tax evasion, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport of goods of a commercial character in the customs area and to create conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">A joint pilot inspection was carried out on 8. 3rd 2004 to 26. 3rd 2004 and aimed at verifying this customs control system.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of check sheets at the border crossing point Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Weighing the Audi A6, issuing the checklist and handing it over to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Parking in the marked sector in the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs clearance in the clearance hall by the Police of the Czech Republic, the Police of the Slovak Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The check-in was confirmed by the various components by stamping the control sheet.</seg>
<seg id="108">(3) Presentation of the vehicle in the physical inspection area.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the inspection sheet, JCD, or other documents to the customs administration employee - checking the execution of all prescribed acts and documents.</seg>
<seg id="110">Physical checks by the relevant services.</seg>
<seg id="111">Release of the vehicle from the customs area.</seg>
<seg id="112">Attention: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the vehicle was weighed directly by employees of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When importing goods into Slovakia, the vehicle was weighed by employees of an authorized legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">The vehicles were recorded in computer records after weighing.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Control sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="117">The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Control sheets and their registration Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="120">When exported from the Czech Republic to Slovakia, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in the electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">From the number of 453 JCD items, the SAO of the Slovak Republic traced 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 items of the JCD were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the workers of the border customs crossing Drietoma.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">When exported from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">From a total of 339 items of the selected audit sample, the SAO, in cooperation with the border customs crossing staff of Starý Hrozenkov, assigned the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets to 295 items of the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by employees of the border customs crossing Drietoma and the export of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The SAO and SAO SR did not detect any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the basis of customs administrations and financial or tax authorities in the territory of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="130">For selected tax subjects, the following were verified:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,</seg>

<seg id="133">The verification of commercial transactions revealed:</seg>
<seg id="134">1st The SAO SR requested verification of the implementation of alcohol exports with a statistical value of 56,989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="135">The SAO identified the corresponding import in the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 42,624.</seg>
<seg id="136">2nd The company engaged in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories applied an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in the VAT return for the month of December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="137">In order to audit reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCDs (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.</seg>
<seg id="138">The SAO SR identified 3 corresponding import JCDs (17 items) with a statistical value of 1 724 321 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="139">The VAT was paid in Slovakia to the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="140">3rd In 2002, the company, which mainly traded in optical instruments, claimed a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4 1 36 000 higher than the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="141">To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.</seg>
<seg id="142">The SAO SR found that this JCD corresponds to import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9,653,827 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="143">The VAT was paid in Slovakia to the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="144">4th A company engaged, inter alia, in the purchase of goods for resale and sale did not record any export of goods in the VAT returns submitted in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports totalled CZK 3,439,888 in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="146">Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) with a statistical value of 1,012,656 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="148">The audit of the SAO SR at the relevant tax office proved the realization of the declared imports and the payment of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="149">5. In 2002, the company, whose subject of business was, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and the sale, manufacture, installation and repair of electrical machinery and appliances, reported in its VAT returns the export of goods worth CZK 12,966,706.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the total value of exports amounted to CZK 14,474,381 in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="151">The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO SR identified in the customs database SR 13 JCDs (50 items) with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the Slovak customs database, it was not possible to identify the corresponding import JCD for 4 export JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 399,776.</seg>
<seg id="154">The competent tax office in Slovakia verified these imports with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer to Slovakia, stated in the minutes of the local investigation that it had not made imports declared on the Czech export JCDs.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO therefore asked the local tax authority to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="157">6th According to the Czech Customs Database, the company engaged in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco labels with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and CZK 12,228,545 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="158">In the VAT returns, the company did not report any exports in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected for verification 5 export JCDs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.</seg>
<seg id="160">For 4 export JCDs (4 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,246,860, the SAO SR identified in the customs database SR 7 JCDs (7 items) with a statistical value of Sk 2,919,514.</seg>
<seg id="161">It was not possible to assign the corresponding import to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the Slovak customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7th The software company did not declare exports of goods in the VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of goods exports in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630,198.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected 9 JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the customs database of the Slovak Republic, the SAO of the Slovak Republic identified 8 JCDs (8 items) with a statistical value of 915 601 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="166">It was not possible to assign the corresponding import to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of 68 286 CZK in the Slovak customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In these cases, it was not possible to identify in the Slovak customs database the corresponding imports for 6 JCDs with a statistical value of CZK 692,800.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- for 2 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the corresponding import JCD could not be identified in the customs database of the Slovak Republic (see points 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to some error in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered imports, e.g. in cases where the importer's name was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="171">Therefore, it cannot be established with certainty that these exports were not made.</seg>
<seg id="172">- for 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia with a statistical value of CZK 399,776 were not proven (see point 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, there is reason to suspect the fictitious export of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming a VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the control of selected financial or tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between financial and customs authorities, the files of tax entities were selected at the audited financial and tax authorities according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. Tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: a) with the highest volume of imports, b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">2. tax entities were selected from the records of the tax or tax authorities according to the amount of: a) applied VAT deductions on import, b) applied excessive VAT deductions, c) claim for SpD refund, d) applied VAT exemption on export,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. taxable persons subject to a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="180">Sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic of risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Control of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="184">At the audited financial offices, the SAO focused mainly on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of the tax authorities for verifying the correctness of the VAT declared,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at tax offices with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparison of data on JCD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- comparison of data from VAT returns on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- the method of verifying the right to VAT exemption when exporting goods or services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax offices contained only records of those imports and exports for which tax entities were obliged to declare imports or exports in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited tax authorities scrutinized the files of tax entities that reported imports in the total amount of CZK 60,396,379 thousand and the corresponding VAT in the total amount of CZK 12,644,052 thousand in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the files of tax entities reporting exports totalling CZK 47,323,111,000 in the tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were scrutinized.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were examined carried out in 2002 and 2003 imports into the Czech Republic from Slovakia with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT of CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.</seg>
<seg id="195">The observed differences between records in the JCD database at financial offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items that were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- for JCD items that were missing from the IRS database, it was verified that they were not cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items where different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of financial authorities, the relevant JCD was requested from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form, including the attached invoices.</seg>
<seg id="199">The audit revealed that the JCD database at financial offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total VAT value of CZK 3,622,000 and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences found</seg>
<seg id="201">A comparison of the JCD database at the tax authorities and the cumulative tax liabilities for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT tax returns of a selected sample of tax subjects revealed the following differences:</seg>
<seg id="202">Differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time lag between the realisation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT charged on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The tax subject could exercise the right of deduction for the importation of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the goods were placed under the relevant procedure or, in the case of the temporary importation procedure, within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the procedure ended.</seg>
<seg id="205">- Time difference between the realization of the export and the moment when the tax subject received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The tax subject was obliged to include data on realized exports exempt from the obligation to apply output tax in the VAT tax return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods left the country, if he also had a tax document, which was JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure of taxpayers to comply with their obligations when reporting imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax subjects did not provide correct data on imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">As tax subjects did not have to attach lists of JCDs to the submitted VAT returns, the control of the right to deduct VAT or the exemption from VAT by the tax authorities was made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Interaction between financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the audited period, import or export duties and VAT were reimbursed or remitted on the basis of customs decisions.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax subjects were required by law to reduce the previously claimed right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax offices received this information, but irregularly or with significant time delays and only from some customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information about changes in the amount of duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data necessary to check the fulfilment of the legal obligation of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, the customs authorities refunded VAT in the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of more than CZK 398 million.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax administrators, some systemic errors in the cooperation of tax authorities with customs authorities and non-fulfilment of some obligations of payers filing VAT and SpD tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="219">Deficiencies in the administration of VAT and SpD were found in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">a) in the event of cancellation of VAT registrations, the fulfilment of the obligation of payers to pay VAT on the registered business assets, or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration, in respect of which the payer applied the tax deduction, was verified only sporadically,</seg>
<seg id="221">(b) the tax authorities did not consistently make use of the possibility of carrying out a tax audit or on-the-spot investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">This led in some cases to insufficient verification of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">c) official records and minutes of the oral hearing did not contain all the necessary data demonstrating the legitimacy of the excessive VAT deductions applied,</seg>
<seg id="224">(d) the tax authorities have not sufficiently verified the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Control of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For a selected sample, the SAO verified or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analyzing the submitted tax returns and applications for tax refunds at selected tax entities, the SAO SR asked the tax office to secure the relevant JCDs documenting import and export, invoices and tax payment documents.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO scrutinized whether the submitted JCDs registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of decisive facts and legal conditions in the application of the input tax deduction in respect of imports, in the refund of excess VAT deduction, in the application of export tax exemption and in the refund of SpD.</seg>
<seg id="230">At 10 audited tax offices, the SAO verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the number of JCD items and the sum of statistical values given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports with a statistical value of 856.2 million Sk were audited, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were audited in the total statistical value of 176 million Sk, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from Slovakia to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">Furthermore, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white technology, packaging technology and software) from EU countries to Slovakia were audited with a total statistical value of 532.8 million Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Interaction between tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO SR found discrepancies between the data registered in the Slovak customs database and the data reported in specific VAT tax returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax subjects (natural persons) declared in their tax returns imports of goods with a total value of SKK 1 589 261, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">During local investigations carried out on the initiative of the SAO SR, tax entities were unable to prove to the tax office the legitimacy of applying input tax with relevant documents on importation and VAT payment,</seg>
<seg id="238">- tax entity (s.r. (o.) in the tax return for the tax period January 2003 declared the received taxable supply in the value of SKU 77 167 576, the export of goods in the value of SKU 18 006 041 and claimed an excess VAT deduction in the amount of SKU 17 157 101.</seg>
<seg id="239">It is apparent from the VAT returns submitted for 2003 that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports, amounting to SKU 59 161 535, which arose in January 2003, was not corrected during the whole of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above-mentioned cases, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excessive VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s.r. (o.) for the tax period January to June 2002, declared in the VAT tax returns the export of goods with a total value of SKK 87,199.</seg>
<seg id="242">Verification in the Slovak customs database revealed that the tax subject carried out an export with a statistical value of 296 747 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax office carried out a number of on-the-spot investigations at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's manager (a UK citizen) had departed and the company had left the rented premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the SAO audit, the tax administrator filed a notice with the criminal authorities on suspicion of committing the crime of non-payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO of the Slovak Republic states that the biggest problems in the management and control of VAT and SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- not making use of the possibility to carry out a VAT tax audit on problematic tax subjects, in particular in cases of application of a high value of excess VAT;</seg>
<seg id="247">- tax audit reports did not include an inventory of audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient verification of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy procedures for tax administrations to take decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, including the loss of the right to impose penalties;</seg>
<seg id="251">- failure to comply with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals,</seg>
<seg id="252">- non-compensation of VAT arrears by the refund deadline,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">On the basis of the shortcomings detected by the audit, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of VAT with a focus on the legitimacy of excessive VAT deductions applied to 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">At all audited tax offices, measures were taken to eliminate the deficiencies detected by the audit, the fulfilment of which will be monitored and audited by the SAO of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="256">6th Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both countries and highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The audit also revealed persistent shortcomings in the fulfilment of obligations of VAT and SpD payers, in the activities of tax or tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the effectiveness and efficiency of tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="259">The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have at their disposal basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic as part of the tax information system. In Slovakia, there is no similar system for the transmission of information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of the administration of VAT and SpD was not the same in view of the different legal regulations and conditions in the territory of both States.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained from the Czech Customs Administration and from documents available at audited financial offices. The SAO audited commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel audits carried out in the area of VAT and SpD assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period before accession to the European Union and pointed out the necessity of further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further deepened in the control of the activities of the tax or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This declaration must be submitted by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from summary reports into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) system, to which tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union have access.</seg>
<seg id="268">The tax or tax authorities then have the opportunity to compare these data with the data contained in the submitted VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is also used to verify the validity of the VAT registration number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied when goods are delivered to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel audits showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these audits will be confronted with the results of the upcoming audits, which will focus, among other things, on the verification of the VIES system, which is supposed to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-Community supplies."</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SPD for budgetary revenues, control activities should focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of inspections in asylum facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State property and funds earmarked for securing the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Control action No. 04/23 - State property and funds earmarked for securing the activities of the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="4">Inspection action No. 15/2004 - Inspection of the economy with the property of the state and financial resources intended for the provision of asylum and temporary refuge for foreigners in Slovakia"</seg>
<seg id="5">1st Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the phenomena that has a global character and has become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, it is caused by the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, in particular for racial, religious, national, political reasons, as well as from the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to gain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of Europe's advanced democratic countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">A large group includes foreigners whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the Geneva Agreement of 1951 and the New York Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, by which the governments of the signatory countries undertook to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation, brought about the establishment of specific principles for refugee assistance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federal Republics ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with adopted international documents and confirmed their binding force within the framework of national legislation by means of a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have also enshrined the provision of asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are contained in the joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of both countries was implemented on the basis of the "Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activities" (hereinafter referred to as the "Contract") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Treaty, both Parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the State of the other Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences for population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooperation consisted in harmonising the programme of control actions, exchanging information to the extent provided for by the Treaty and drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the controls.</seg>
<seg id="20">During the first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, the same areas of audited issues and control procedures during the preparation of auditing events were determined.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, the common points for the control action programme were clarified.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the third joint meeting, which took place during the auditing operation from 8.11. to 10.11.2004, the experience of the ongoing audits was exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="23">The modalities of the control outputs have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was drawn up between 14.2. and 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audits were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by auditors from the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited bodies were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MoI') and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ').</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic carried out an inspection of the section of defense, interior and štátnych úradov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "MÚ").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data covering a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2nd Recap of control results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Assessment of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subjects of the parallel checks were: - the asylum process, - asylum facilities, - the management of funds and state property, - the internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of experience between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place in the phase of preparation and implementation of audit actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange allowed for a more thorough evaluation of the submitted documents, to analyse the causes of the identified differences in the security of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, it was possible to focus on the decisive problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ultimately, this had a positive impact on the quality of the implementation of the control activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of the results of the audit</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with the documents of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "EU") was the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">Legislation in this area continues to be adopted after the accession of both countries to the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has steadily increased, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security for asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the length of the asylum procedure until asylum is granted or refused, as well as the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some levies collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="48">In asylum facilities, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, food, health care and basic material equipment and sanitary supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organized as part of leisure activities and the conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, and in the Czech Republic also integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one day of stay depends on the occupancy and facilities of the centre and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is broadly stable.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1 000 jobs in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, whose increasing numbers are expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the provision of services. Crucial expenditure under this heading was the cost of lodging and boarding applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, the cost of health care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service to protect asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant share of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the migration policy and asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures addressing legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services accounted for the bulk of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial and state property management.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were shortcomings in particular in the area of the use of state budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were designated by the Act on the State Budget, when current expenditures were used to cover actions in the nature of technical appreciation of long-term tangible assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The law on accounting in the area of inventory and non-compliance with the chart of accounts was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor shortcomings were also found in the handling of state property when it was left to another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in the Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act and the Waste Act was violated by leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not authorized to handle the waste.</seg>
<seg id="64">Furthermore, in the Slovak Republic, weaknesses were found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for the purchase of electricity and natural gas, in public procurement and in the management of state property when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of liquidating unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system was ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation in force governing the method of financial control.</seg>
<seg id="66">No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some shortcomings, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic positively evaluate the progress of SUZ and MÚ in providing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the findings obtained during the audit, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic state that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organizational units of both countries have managed the tasks associated with the care of asylum seekers to an appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is operational and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the audit were discussed with the interested statutory representatives of the relevant state organizational units on both the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience from the audit be used in other joint audit actions within the framework of international cooperation of SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="72">3rd Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 New York Protocol).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legal regulation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic it is from 1. 1st 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and on Amendment to Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended five times (by Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process and the adoption of other amendments will be tied to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No.325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were political documents in their binding nature.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already during the adoption of this law, efforts were made to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">An important change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became part of Community law from 1 May. 1999 under the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has also necessitated the development of appropriate legislation, i.e. the creation of legal instruments with appropriate legal force.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the Supreme Audit Office audit, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">Once they have been transposed into Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission how it has transposed them.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge on the territory of the Slovak Republic was laid down with effect from 1.1.1996 by the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No.480/2002 Coll. on Asylum and on Amendments to Certain Acts, which incorporated the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20. 7th 2001 on minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to Act No. 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, the third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a Slovak language basic course during their stay in the integration centre, the appointment of a guardian by the courts for minor foreigners if they are staying on the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, and the possibility for applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances specified in the amendment to the Act.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU law in the area of migration and asylum process was evaluated in the European Commission's regular reports on preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report drew attention to the insufficient staffing capacity of the MoA, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4th Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters concerning refugees have been the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior.</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective from 1. 1st In 1996, the Ministry of Interior established an organizational unit of the state of SUZ. The reason for this was the separation of the performance of the state administration in the area of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry of Interior, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services for the MoI to participants in asylum procedures and asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, the MoA performs decisive tasks in the field of the asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by special regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to deciding on foreigners" applications for asylum in the first level of administrative proceedings and complex operation of asylum facilities in the field of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it prepares concepts for the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the development of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have been significantly influenced by the cooperation and support provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A particular benefit was his financial participation in the reconstruction of the housing stock for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Evolution of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is illustrated in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increased number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the audited period, asylum was granted in 394 cases, including 83 cases in 2001, 103 cases in 2002 and 208 cases in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">During the audited period, a total of 22 731 cases were not granted asylum and in 22 636 cases the asylum procedure was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties to the proceedings as at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been the subject of a decision and those to whom the decision has not been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="108">It also includes persons who have been waived for missing the time limit for lodging an appeal or whose previous decision has been annulled and a new one has not yet been issued.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has steadily increased.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, it was 10 358 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="111">A significant increase in the number of applicants occurred in 2001, when 8 131 applicants were registered, which represented an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1 556 persons applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are presented in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylums were granted in the audited period and their number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in individual years.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum procedure was halted in a total of 23,088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">The bulk of the applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without permission, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003 it was more than 94% of persons.</seg>
<seg id="118">The duration of one applicant's stay in an asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The findings of the Ministry also show that the majority of applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which is not supported by documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In such cases, the asylum system is used for a purpose by the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic considerations, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not a ground for granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an application should be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 par. 1 (a) 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, is considered to be manifestly unjustified and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognised principles to identify economic migrants have not yet been developed to distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and to speed up the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country in terms of international migration and the countries of destination of migration were and remain Western European countries.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple purpose-built applications for asylum from being made in several EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants return to the country of first registration after a positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the external border of the EU countries, so the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create the conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until a decision is taken on whether or not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Use of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security for asylum seekers in accordance with international agreements and national legislative arrangements based on them.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the length of the asylum procedure until the final decision granting asylum, as well as their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The increasing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social allowances.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some levies collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, meals were CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per one day of residence was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to pocket money, an allowance of up to a minimum subsistence allowance may be granted to asylum seekers accommodated in self-catering accommodation centres and to applicants accommodated privately outside asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="138">Paragraph 84 of Act No 325/1999 on Asylum, as amended, grants municipalities the right to a contribution to cover the costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility in its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period amounted to CZK 7 per person per day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">In the audited period, the amount of the contribution was CZK 120 per pupil per month, provided that the person attended the school for at least 10 days in the given month.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, meal allowances were 70 Sk per person per day, 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per day of stay was on average 442 SKK in 2001, 447 SKK in 2002 and 445 SKK in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">In accordance with Act No 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, municipalities in whose territory an asylum facility is situated are granted a contribution towards the partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and operation of the asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">So far, municipalities have made only partial use of the possibility to apply for a contribution, which is set at SKK 1,500 per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries provides for a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure for issuing asylum decisions, while allowing for an extension of this period in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is the lodging of appeals against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of application for asylum (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications had been finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to MÚ data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum make use of the statutory possibility to extend the time limit by lodging an appeal with the courts.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and at the time of the inspection the court proceedings had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="154">A certain benefit in the shortening of the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of common workplaces of the ÚÚ and the Border and Foreign Police of the Police Force in reception centres in Adamov-Gbelochy, Opatovskej Novej Ves and Liptovské Vlachochy, which took place at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This envisages simplifying procedures and shortening the time limits for procedures between the two parts of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created appropriate conditions for the provision of services to persons subject to asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="158">In asylum facilities, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, food, health care, pocket money and basic material equipment and sanitary supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organized as part of leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is competent to manage the state property in the premises of the reception centre Vyšní Lhoty, the reception and accommodation centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the buildings of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ also ensures the operation of asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of § 80 para. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the accommodation centres is 1 977 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities which asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception operations referred to in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violation of the obligation to stay in the reception centre is considered a misdemeanor.</seg>
<seg id="167">The accommodation centres to which asylum seekers arrive from reception centres shall be used to accommodate asylum seekers until a final decision on their application for asylum has become final.</seg>
<seg id="168">Provided that certain conditions are met, asylum seekers have the possibility to leave the accommodation centres, or alternatively. to be in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Applicants for asylum shall be entitled to accommodation, meals, other services and pocket money free of charge in the reception and accommodation centres in which they are registered for their stay, provided that they have endured the acts necessary to establish their financial and financial situation and that such circumstances are such that they cannot reasonably be required to reimburse even part of those services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for the temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or they can arrange it themselves within the framework of the state integration program.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients cover all accommodation costs and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with recognised refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">In order to compare asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best indicator of the level of costs per physical day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of persons who were actually provided with the services provided by the asylum facility on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, facilities operated by SUZs identified as own and facilities operated by legal entities on the basis of Section 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one day's stay in the SUZ's own asylum facility decreases as the capacity of those facilities increases. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of running the objects are allocated to more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionally with the increasing number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, applicants were accommodated in their own asylum facilities in a crisis capacity.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to address the capacity crisis of asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">Expenditure per applicant per day of stay was lower in those years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, it is not possible to maintain a high level of filling of these devices in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="185">The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated requirement for higher accommodation capacity should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of contracted asylum facilities allows for the adoption of operational solutions to the capacity of asylum facilities where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and accommodation centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The MÚ has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residence centre Brezová pod Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 seats and the residence centre 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">The growing number of asylum seekers was solved by the MÚ by establishing a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University Bratislava with a flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 places.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the concluded contract, the lessor also provides services connected with the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the MÚ solved the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Reception centres had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% in the audited period and an average occupancy rate of 33% to 50% in the residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="197">The occupancy rate varied according to the season and was highest in the last months of the year, when a much larger number of applicants applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 places will be possible after the reconstruction of resorts in Opatovská Nová Ves and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">With the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006, the number of places will increase by a further 550 persons.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">The cost of operating asylum facilities is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity, which will provide premises and ensure the operation of the facility, including the related activities, is one of the ways to ensure, at reasonable cost, the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6th Management of funds and state property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of management</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, the approved budgeted expenditures of SUZ were increased by thirteen budgetary measures by CZK 103,077,000 in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of this, CZK 89 979 thousand (87.29%) were earmarked funds. Most of it was earmarked for dealing with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538 thousand) and ensuring health care provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, expenditures of the SUZ were increased by CZK 88,362 thousand by twenty budgetary measures.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of these, CZK 62,282 thousand (70.48%) were earmarked funds, of which the bulk (CZK 53,200 thousand) was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, expenditures of the SUZ were increased by fourteen budgetary measures by a total of CZK 88,078,000.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of this, 82,000 thousand CZK (93.99%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51 000 000 was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24 000 000 for dealing with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7 000 000 for the humanitarian evacuation programme of the disabled inhabitants of the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the utilisation of selected SUZ expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the above overview that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenditure incurred for the purchase of services ranged between 37,07% and 38.23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">Excessive expenditure under this heading was the cost of housing and boarding applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, the cost of medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing security in individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) accounted for a significant share of SUZ's total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, material purchases accounted for a significant share of SUZ's total expenditure (approximately 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest share (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the MoA to safeguard migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures addressing legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">The draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part was characterised, especially in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the requirements of the MoA, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the needs to finance their legal entitlements, and the resources provided mainly in the main category of current expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter addressed the disproportion in the course of the year by several budgetary measures, which increased the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by up to 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the utilization of selected expenditures of the Ministry in the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on salaries, salaries and insurance premiums, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51%, and expenditure on materials and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure, accounted for the bulk of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% was spent on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% on food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Expenditure on accommodation and catering services accounted for another significant part, with a share ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">Capital expenditure accounted for a relatively low proportion, ranging from 1.03% to 6.25%.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Deficiencies identified</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and property.</seg>
<seg id="228">These shortcomings were mainly in the following areas: a) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were designated by the Act on the State Budget, when current expenditures were used to cover actions in the nature of technical appreciation of fixed tangible assets; b) the violation of the Act on Accounting in the area of inventories and non-compliance with the guiding chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor shortcomings were also found in the handling of state property, where it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not authorized to handle waste violated the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="230">Furthermore, in the Slovak Republic, weaknesses were found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for the purchase of electricity and natural gas, in public procurement and in the management of state property when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of liquidating unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7th Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, the SUZ was as of 1.7. 320/2001 Coll., on Financial Control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, ongoing and follow-up checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal auditor of the SUZ was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Each year, the SUZ is issued with a plan of financial, social and operational technical inspections aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of funds and state property in individual asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">42 management checks were carried out in 2002 and 54 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct performance of control activities in departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations is ensured by the Institute of Control of the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="237">During the audited period, the performance of tasks in the field of asylum policy was not audited.</seg>
<seg id="238">The MÚ's internal control system is focused primarily on carrying out preliminary and ongoing financial control in accordance with Act No.502/2001 Coll., on Financial Control and Audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of financial control is also regulated by the internal regulations of the IO Director.</seg>
<seg id="240">The factual focus of the audit activity as part of the management of individual departments was determined in the framework of the annual plan of the MoA.</seg>
<seg id="241">Directors of departments have been designated as responsible for exercising control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the written documentation submitted, no deficiencies were found.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the entry into force of Decree No 28 of 23 of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic. 4th 2004, the IO is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.</seg>
<seg id="244">The organisational security of this task will need to be finalised in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel audits of expenditures on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of the trans-European transport networks, it would be difficult to imagine a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating the conditions for rapid, safe, reliable and inexpensive transport of people and freight is an important task for the state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a very demanding task, both organisationally and technically and financially.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts at sustainable mobility often find it difficult to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction of transport infrastructure, also thanks to the necessary measures in favour of the environment, is costly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considered procedures and decision-making by the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings in public financial resources that can be used in other ways for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the roles of audit institutions is to actively seek out deficiencies that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures on transport infrastructure constructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit institutions should not only draw the public administration's attention to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">The two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as Germany and the Czech Republic) the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH") and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as "SAO") carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (the D8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A17 motorway in Germany) in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">The highways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to the cooperation with the SAO, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough audit of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the basis of close cooperation with the BRH, the SAO obtained for comparative purposes the necessary data on the level of German bridge and tunnel costs.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction process, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">The </seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and to ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, as a result, RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit work, the prices of bridges on the D8 and A17 motorways were compared on the basis of a conversion per m2 of the bridge structure area.</seg>
<seg id="24">The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per m2 of area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase was also attributable to the delay in the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the tunnel construction costs, the auditors found that the tunnel prices on the D8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">The BRH and the SAO now have a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which they will be able to rely in future efficiency checks of funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, both audit institutions recommend: standardization of bridge constructions and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The main features of the cooperation were its team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel check, auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report informs on the course and results of parallel audits of funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The audits focused on economy, efficiency and effectiveness of incurred expenses.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel audits were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel controls took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures in the amount of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately EUR 690 million) on the border section of the D8 motorway, which has the number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million of European funds (ISPA) were planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to the parallel audit carried out together with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A17 motorway amounted to some €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden - central and southern part of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 motorway runs from the state border of the Czech Republic/Germany to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, the border sections of both motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">I'm going to get to the end of the road, to the end of the road, to the end of the road, to the</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, the section No. 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of České středohoří.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts carried out in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity of 22 940 vehicles per day should be in 2008 on the border section No 0807 of the D8 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic to connect the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway on the common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, therefore the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of parallel inspections carried out by both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two SAIs have discussed close cooperation in the control of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1st</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany contributes financially to the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction rests with the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, the BRH did not itself have the opportunity to carry out an inspection of this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2nd</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically as regards the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3rd</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to make sure of the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should enable the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory discussions, the Agreement on the Coordinated Inspection of the D 8/A 17 motorway was signed by the Presidents of both SAIs on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint working meetings of auditors of the BRH and the SAO took place throughout 2006 at intervals of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The meetings dealt with current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a unified methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">Continuous exchange of information was an important feature of the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH carried out most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the procurement procedure, the SAO prepared for the most part a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for control in the civil service differ in the way control actions are concluded in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, both SAIs drew their own audit conclusions on their findings during their audits.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved in parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Border bridge construction</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 agreement, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a possible completion date for the construction of the border bridge in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">Both sides then agreed to postpone this date to the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany accounts for 42.13% of the bridge's construction.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD approved the coupled steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of double pillars from seven to five and the consequent ecological benefit of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">Moreover, the comparative calculations carried out by the RMD indicated that the coupled steel-concrete structure should be a less costly option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was stated that the new steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it's 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">In the course of awarding the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="85">It did not prepare contract documents adequately describing the evaluation criteria and the sub-criteria for comparing tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the tender evaluation committee and the Director-General evaluating the tenders in a subjective and problematic manner.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful tenderer challenged the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition resulted in the contract for the award of the construction contract being signed later than originally planned.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after evaluation of the bids, was wasted and the construction time was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in less time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The procedure offered included a double assembly of the bridge superstructure, a change in the structure of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of the assembly areas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Moreover, the construction company was not able to procure the originally designed type of steel within the required timeframe.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel - at a cost of approximately EUR 4 million more, which had to be fully paid by the RMD - made it possible to shorten the time for anti-corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to shorten the total construction time of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other financing adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced time allocated to the works resulted in an increase in the price of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">At present, the net cost is around €25.9 million, not taking into account the automatic price increase (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Price comparison of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">The two SAIs analysed the prices of bridges on the D8 and A17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, the tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify precisely the relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two supreme audit institutions have set the following principles for comparing bridge prices: start from the actual price paid for the bridge excluding value added tax (VAT rates differ in the Czech Republic and the SNR and are subject to changes); do not take into account prices for special bridge foundations; convert prices in CZK into € according to the rate of the European Central Bank valid as of 30. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On both D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various constructions (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the homogeneity of the examined structures, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the abundance of the set allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The inspections revealed that the prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the dependence of price on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">To find these bridges, a method was used to detect atypical values in the set of numbers, as well as a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (the distance from the regression curve upwards is decisive for determining atypically expensive bridges).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypically high price of those bridges should only be taken as an indication of which bridges should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the reasons for the high price in each identified case should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental requirements or any other plausible reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">In view of the fact that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see the table below), the proven negative dependence of the bridge price on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on the D 8 are higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During the joint meetings, two possible causes of this were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1st</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for a part of the motorway route that is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too large for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2nd</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic there is greater variability in bridge construction than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is taken at the time when the RMD submits the planning application.</seg>
<seg id="129">Although the RMD selects bridge types from several variants at this time, economy plays a minor role in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond the scope of this auditing operation.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel-concrete bridge on the D8 and A17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, the prices of tunnels on D 8 were found to be twice as high as those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with those in Germany did not show any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden motorway - Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved a concept for the development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">The section No 0805 through České středohoří should have been acquired earlier than the border section No 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic is procuring the D8 motorway as part of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme No. 327 220 - Construction of the D8 motorway Prague - Ústí nad Labem - state border of the Czech Republic/Germany - set two objectives for the construction of the D8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1st</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem - a national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2nd</seg>
<seg id="146">improve connections between Prague and Berlin in the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin - Istanbul - international destination.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through České středohoří was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section no. 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the completion date is not the same as the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through České středohoří is now in the stage of an official zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">The actions do not have the force of res judicata.</seg>
<seg id="152">It cannot therefore be excluded that the section leading through the České středohoří will be completed several years later than stated in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of section 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD carried out an estimation of capital expenditures for the border section D 8 No. 0807 and the section No. 0805 through České středohoří in 1999-2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">In these capital expenditures, the investment costs included are estimated at about €639 million combined for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">All considered motorways and expressways opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section the traffic intensity of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All considered motorways and expressways opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section the traffic intensity of 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All considered motorways and expressways opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section the traffic intensity of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through České středohoří would be completed in time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section through České středohoří will not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections excluding VAT, calculated at 31. 12. 2005, were €897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level used in the 2001 economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more costly route, which would affect the above-mentioned threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable with a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but the study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for the missing section through České středohoří calculates the traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="171">With a higher load on bypass routes for the missing section through České středohoří, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above-mentioned reduction in revenues and cost increases mean that the already low EIRR expected to be achieved by the construction of the D 8 frontier section will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">The construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 also involved similar cost overruns as those two sections on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany envisaged costs of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost-benefit ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have soared to about €670 million, reducing the cost-benefit ratio by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to the parallel audit carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">The BRH found that the competent State approval authority had requested an off-road tunnel for Section A 17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the inspection, the BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">This resulted in savings of around €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">During the assessment of the first section A 17, the BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example illustrates this:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not carry out a survey of the conditions of the bedrock in the Dölzschen rocks because the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was done only after the tunnel cutting machine hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks inside were more weathered than anticipated during the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">As a result, costly measures such as anchoring, grouting and stone-falling safety nets had to be taken, costing about €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">It's not going to be e</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), further training of drilling staff (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to the overrun of the project duration (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">As a result, the cost overrun amounted to around €10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">Based on the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, the BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter leadership in its supervision of road construction works.</seg>
<seg id="192">In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Roads and Motorways Directorates the necessary impetus to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH obtained audit findings on the preparation, assignment and course of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both SAIs have built a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future inspections can rely.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the D8 motorway did not differ from those of A17.</seg>
<seg id="197">Auditors of both institutions participating in the cooperation gained new experience which they can use during further audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects implemented under the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007 - 2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The developing community of Europe's people is driving cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let us allow this community to give the opening word to this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of the neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">185 million EU citizens (or 37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often remnants of the darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover sea basins, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programs are bilateral, but some involve more than two neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes run for seven years and have a total budget of €5.7 billion from the EU budget. EUR.</seg>
<seg id="11">The programmes include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investment in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, advice on employment issues, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funding is provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four features: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint funding.</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of the project activities are clearly defined and allocated to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: the joint selection of the lead partner, the joint preparation of the project and the application, the conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, the assumption of overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, the total payments of support are received by the lead partner and transferred to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out in the territory of regions and voivodeships adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic-Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS ČR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">€258 187 467 was earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from the European Funds (ERDF) totalling €219 459 344 (85%), which must be spent by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the use of EU funds from the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007 - 2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The cooperation agreement between the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both SAIs on 27 February 2013 after previous mutual negotiations at the meeting of the heads of supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to examine whether the implementation of the operational programme is carried out in accordance with legal regulations and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system works reliably, whether the objectives of the operational programme are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the conditions of the support provided.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel check, in which the audit authorities independently examined, on the basis of their statutory mandate, subjects the content of which had previously been jointly discussed.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit also included elements of a performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">Selected topics were tested on a sample of projects by project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">As a result of the checks carried out, the audit conclusions were published in the usual manner by both offices.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the basis of the two audit conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report has been produced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected common control sample comprised six projects (Annex 1) which fall under aid area 1.1 - Strengthening transport accessibility and support area 2.2 - Support for tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the utilization of funds from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to the beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the whole OPIE CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to the audit of a common sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and the NIK audited two others (all from the support area 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">Funds paid to ERDF beneficiaries audited by the SAO and the NIK amounted to a total of € 25 362 174 (SAO) and € 8 450 784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited volume of funds represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries of aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both audits carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and the NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the materiality level.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of the OPIE CR-POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The auditees, who were part of the management and control system, took steps to limit the risk of incorrect use of funds and non-use of ERDF funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the Operational Programme is the high level of fulfilment of the set objectives, which was supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of project implementation.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS</seg>
<seg id="44">The A. Evaluation of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out an audit of the management and control system of the OPPS CR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development POL) and the auditors (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the JTS and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in connection with the setting up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of the progress achieved, the evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the use of programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on grants, the control activities of the managing authority, the setting of the performance of the activities and the results of the audits of the delegated audit body and the system of coordination and monitoring of irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the establishment of control plans at the site of project implementation were examined and the evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The examination of the control system included a review of the administrative and on-the-spot checks carried out, which allowed the approval of e.g. supplies of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, as well as the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant shortcomings were detected by the SAO audit in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on the provided subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of project evaluation and approval, the risk of non-transparency of the process was identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other weaknesses were found in the setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) assessed the control and management system implemented by the MA as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Irregularities identified by the NIK concerning the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of the applicable laws and rules were not assessed as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These discrepancies had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the whole OPIE CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the irregularities identified, the NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit did not show any discrepancy between the indicators and objectives set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all audited projects, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the operational programme project applications were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are in line with the results of the survey of the social evaluation of project implementation described below.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect to which the SAO and the NIK paid attention in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the fulfilment of the expected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects as well as the objectives of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, a public opinion survey was carried out in the summer of 2013 in the place of implementation of projects selected for the joint audit sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both among the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and among the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey mainly covered the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and the societal function of the projects, including the investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents per project is shown in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The examination of the survey responses indicated that the overall social evaluation of the projects was good at 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both in terms of objectives and other parameters specified in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents, the projects examined met the criteria expressed in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and the re-establishment of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall evaluation of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by the respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the opinions of the participants of the panel discussions (target groups) carried out in the framework of the NIK audit on the Polish side, who pointed out the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive reception by the public and the fulfilment of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">The C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">In the case of the beneficiaries, the compliance of the factual and timely implementation of the project with the timetable and content of the project application was examined, the fulfilment of the set objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in projects, the handling of any project revenues, the fulfilment of the obligation of separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the prohibition of financing projects from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, the fulfilment of the mandatory publicity concerning, in particular, the dissemination of awareness of the sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions for the eligibility of project expenditures, the selection of contractors and the verification of the delivered performances on the basis of public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the shortcomings of the SAOs and NIKs qualified as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found to be €85,094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the established materiality level related to the total audited amount of funds for a sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the discrepancies, the SAO and the NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects by the beneficiaries positively.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the commitments under the terms of the aid were properly implemented by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds earmarked for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">However, seven of the eight beneficiaries audited by NIK were found to have irregularities in the fulfilment of material and financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned in particular inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, but did not affect the choice of contractor or the delivery of contracted works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of all projects audited by the NIK can the irregularity found, which concerned non-compliance with reporting obligations, be classified as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which EUR 8 231 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditures amounting to CZK 2,098,053 in three of the 19 audited projects (of which EUR 76,863 were financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included non-delivery of paid materials and works or expenditure for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system, especially with regard to the consistent determination of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, efforts should also be made to establish indicators at programme and project level that allow more reliable verification of the achievement of the impacts identified.</seg>
<seg id="88">Comments and recommendations resulting from inspections carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate audit conclusions of the SAO and the NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICATIONS</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was prepared in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public works procurement and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel audit carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private spheres.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the State is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the Single Economic Area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its rules, the EU has set thresholds above which the contracting authority must comply with certain requirements to ensure a broad and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts below EU thresholds, the regulation of their award remains a matter for individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with a consequent high potential for damage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair advantage (corruption prevention).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits in the area of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The audits included the awarding of contracts below European thresholds in order to cover the area of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit findings of the two SAIs are summarised in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Areas of control and institutions audited</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH evaluation is based on area-based inspections of the above-mentioned areas carried out at the German building administrations responsible for federal transport and land constructions between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, highway construction and large-scale building construction projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The BRH included findings from past audits in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO's evaluation is based on audits carried out between 2008 and 2012, which focused on road constructions, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other constructions in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, federal public procurement is mostly carried out by the Land Building Administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, state institutions for road and rail construction are responsible for awarding public contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of building construction, public procurement is carried out by the beneficiaries of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used in the various stages of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation should take into account the differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and subordinate standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts .</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details concerning the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called federal government procurement manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail in the light of legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation concerning contracts with a value above and below European thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Procurement law underwent substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up scope for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and restricted procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European threshold are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for competition, negotiated procedure), but these are practically identical to the above-mentioned conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and when calling for competition, any candidate may submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific lots and subdividing it into subcontracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">By awarding contracts divided into these lots, as many candidates as possible are given a chance to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested instruments for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, it is necessary to apply the conditions of European procedures also in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception is the simplified below-threshold procedure, where the contracting authority may use less onerous procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting entities and share of each type of procedure in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">CZK, of which CZK 1 138 billion. CZK (15%) accounted for the share of public contracts, which in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of federal road and land construction projects (excluding railway and water construction) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal contracts for land works and transport works was as follows: 80.7 % open procedures and calls for tender; 12.7 % restricted procedures and calls for tender;</seg>
<seg id="55">6.6% negotiated procedures and direct procurement; 33.2% is the proportion of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached CZK 118.6 billion in 2011. CZK , which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 it amounted to EUR 194.0 billion. CZK, which was 37% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of types of procurement procedures in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14,3 % restricted procedures; 9,5 % negotiated procedures; 8,4 % simplified procedures for below-threshold contracts; 2,7 % other procedures.</seg>
<seg id="59">These figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; the prevention of corruption, which must always be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open importance. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and the BRH carried out parallel audits of European public works contracts with an emphasis on preventing corruption in their respective countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The audits focused on the comparison of legal regulations in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public contracts in the field of land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="64">The following are the key findings:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national laws of both countries (points 1. and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Preventing corruption is not only an objective of the EU directive, but of the two countries" national procurement rules, which differ partly in focus and detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the basic requirement to be met by the tender documents is the inclusion of all the information needed for the preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, insufficient definition of the subject matter of the contract is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, the division of contracts into lots is required wherever possible in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement is complied with in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO audits proved that in the Czech Republic, public works in the field of road construction are awarded without being divided into parts or subdivided, but only into very significant parts. This method may distort competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Such restrictions on market potential may result in significant cost increases and risk improper price negotiations and impermissible agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting entities, under certain conditions, to additionally award additional works if this need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for correct determination of the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, according to the applicable regulations, contracting entities are free to designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely the open procedure or the restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">German procurement and budget law rules enshrine the primacy of open procedures for both European and national tenders, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a wider range of candidates to submit bids and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it more difficult to negotiate prices illegally between candidates.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best value for money is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">For large contracts with an estimated total price reaching or exceeding the thresholds set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited have always launched a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Correct determination of the expected value of the contract plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective instrument.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are only used in the field of road construction but are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish preliminary information and a contract notice in order to strengthen competition by allowing candidates to prepare themselves in good time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Beyond EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should rotate as often as possible the candidates they invite to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to prevent the risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the contracting authorities audited did not comply with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting entities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between those candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must, as far as possible, be prevented from restricting competition by means of illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the German contracting authorities audited did not meet this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">The labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements for tenders are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (paragraph 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of bids is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive but have not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities transmitted their tenders to third parties for inspection without their prior assessment, without adequately documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The tenders were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (section 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">For reasons of legal protection enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule is also designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The procurement documentation of the audited contracting authorities in both countries was not always complete or fully credible.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always properly respected in the minutes of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="113">Moreover, some of the weaknesses identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly complied with their reporting obligations (paragraph 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of guiding principles of European procurement law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts with a view to ensuring the free movement of goods and services and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures for the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), which were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general EU procurement principles include in particular: the requirement for a competitive environment; the requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; the requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include In addition, the Directive on the coordination of public procurement procedures includes provisions for construction projects with a total estimated value of €5 million or more.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the content of the specifications; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the procedure; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Remedies Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of the procurement right, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In neither country is there a legal definition of what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">Corruption is generally understood as the abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is encouraged by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">Overall corruption-related damage is estimated to amount to 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or allowing unfair conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, capability and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">This is why preventing corruption is a key task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">In particular, practices and procedures need to be checked in areas particularly susceptible to corruption in order to take adequate measures to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective checks can substantially reduce the vulnerability of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">Public works procurement is generally considered to be an area particularly vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures in the field of prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, in particular active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis: the priority of open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; the separation of the planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete procurement documentation.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other preventive measures against corruption have become part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor procurement for the construction of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">With this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed in order to identify any discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, including on the level of labour and civil law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were set out by the government in the "Government Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2012," which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of these measures was incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and related implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: reduction of the thresholds for small-scale contracts; obligation of prior notification by the contracting authority, including the reasons for the contract; prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in the restricted procedure and abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of inspections relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender documents</seg>
<seg id="150">The specifications shall contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documentation must make it possible to process the tender price.</seg>
<seg id="152">For this to be possible, candidates must not be exposed to risks which they could not have anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="153">The specifications shall include, in particular, the specifications, the requirements for demonstrating the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">European law contains, in particular, requirements concerning technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must restrict competition as little as possible and all candidates must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">The specification shall be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific specific products are admissible on a very limited scale in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of preventing corruption is that tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data which create scope for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that specifications should be given in general terms without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specifications shall define precisely the supplies and services required and detail the number of units of work and supply.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be given by unit of labour or supply (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases is it permissible to define the required works in terms of their functionality.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, specifications must be drawn up in a complete and unambiguous manner.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies the necessity of which is not entirely obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or time worked should be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documents shall exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare its tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender must be published only when the specifications are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for the contracting authority to award construction contracts in instalments.</seg>
<seg id="176">A contracting authority may divide a contract into several separate lots where the nature of the subject-matter of such a contract so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule of dividing works into lots is required, either quantitatively (sub-supplies) or according to specific considerations (specialised lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows SMEs to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is usually considered to be the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, procurement documents must include evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the tenderer comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria against which its tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to include evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European calls for tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">Where the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion of any information which would help to identify specific interested firms, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other impermissible competitive advantages without the contracting authority's knowledge through contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents relating to tenders and to make them available for screening.</seg>
<seg id="187">The client is a one-stop shop for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional work or modification of existing works after the conclusion of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries allows the award of a multi-works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of additional work under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">Moreover, the additional work must be necessary and must be specific to the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the award of additional works.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may risk a greater time lag in the implementation of the contract and the possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where an additional works contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of the modified works or additional works.</seg>
<seg id="196">The calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to additional work, less work may occur during construction, i.e. jobs that weren't needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, less work and more work cannot be compensated for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">The BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In isolated cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have since been replaced by EU standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications included particulars requiring a particular brand name, e.g. for a public sign resistance system, to prevent water penetration or for noise protection cladding, although this was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications divided into items</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH did not observe non-conformity with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services according to the quantity specifications divided into lots in a single case of inspection of the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, the tender documents were fully prepared before the call for tenders was launched.</seg>
<seg id="209">However, in various cases, documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in appropriations or in the timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, the tender documents included works and supplies whose need was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Division of the contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for not splitting deliveries into lots has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">The BRH did not find any shortcomings in the criteria for evaluating tenders prior to the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of the names of authorised independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Interested authorised experts were mentioned in many of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names appeared on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or annexed opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the case of ground construction projects, these cases were found mainly in the tender documentation, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the processing of the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities indicated that they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to examine the tender documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 flats, reference was made directly to specific manufacturers and product brands.</seg>
<seg id="224">The sponsor did not accept the use of other similar product types or justify why it required the supply of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of university facilities, the tender documentation included references to specific business companies and specific product designations.</seg>
<seg id="226">General overview of specifications and partial specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">In the case of the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not unequivocally define in the tender documents the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the statement of assessment and set only the built-up area in cubic metres for each building as a unit of measurement.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the ring road, the specifications for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the contract and the change in technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">In the case of the construction of social buildings, the tender documentation had defects that forced the creation of additional works (there was a lack of precise focus, insufficient structural and technical survey was carried out, drawings were missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">In the tender documents for the construction of the large library, the interior elements were mentioned only in a descriptive manner, without specifying the qualitative requirements for the products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of the interior equipment of the building was provided by subcontractors who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award the contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">An analysis of three large road constructions during the construction of the ring road showed that their award in an open procedure in parts (separately for selected buildings) could achieve savings of up to CZK 790 million from the achieved price of public contracts of CZK 15,508 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, with the award of six construction buildings as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 62.5 million could have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">CZK, i.e. 25% of the contracted price and if 20 bridges were awarded as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 287.8 million could be achieved, i.e. also 25%.</seg>
<seg id="239">When constructing the roads, the contracting authority set out in the tender documents qualification criteria which limited the participation of small suppliers in the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the terms and conditions of the open procedure per supplier for one construction of the motorway, the contracting authority required, among other things, the contractor's practice of implementing at least three road constructions with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million each, completed or put into operation within the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of constructions over CZK 700 million in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the delivery of another motorway construction in an open procedure included six separate constructions for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of construction works in the last three years of CZK 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. €2.5 billion out of €3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of EUR 13.2 billion There were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Multitask Area</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of additional works and did not assign additional works to any of the procedures specified in the Act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of unapproved additional works in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million without VAT (21% increase) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million without VAT (91% increase).</seg>
<seg id="249">The cause of the additional work was mainly an ambiguous definition of the amount and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of the construction of university facilities, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documentation some works and supplies whose necessity for completion and final approval of the construction was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and supplies, he concluded amendments to the contract for work with the construction contractor with an increase in price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices of the additional works determined without competitive tendering were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same contractor.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On a selected sample of constructions, the SAO found that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 355.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre section of the four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions on tender documents are almost identical in both countries and are in line with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and fair competition and prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable candidates to calculate costs and prepare their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and protects the contracting authority against the need to award additional works.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by additional rules to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and engaging in manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries the specification requirements are mostly met.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases shortcomings have been identified which could lead to a restriction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The currently applicable rule in Germany requiring bulky construction projects to be subdivided into lots seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-scale projects without partial award or division into large-scale parts may limit the range of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">The result of the strict requirement for references of candidates, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of candidates for road construction works, is the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small group of applicants and therefore small and medium-sized companies have no chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixing and other illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">As regards the award and payment of additional contracts for additional works or modified works, regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, the additional works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its announcement.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit of 20% is exceeded, additional works must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dividing works into parts can avoid restricting competition and the consequent adverse consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU thresholds</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers that will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting authority may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited or may limit the scope according to the criteria specified.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of major project works with a value reaching or exceeding the thresholds set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must comply in particular with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million (CZK 125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is admissible.</seg>
<seg id="288">If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by launching a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below the threshold of €1.0 million (CZK 25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the estimated value of the entire contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Splitting a building project or deliberately estimating its cost too low with the intention of avoiding the fundamental obligation to launch a European call for tenders is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">The choice of management type is very important for preventing corruption, as restricting competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law, is an important part of the tender documentation.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and thresholds in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures also for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of procedure are allowed only if the conditions laid down by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech legislation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of corruption prevention prefers open procedures or a public invitation to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted proceedings, are admissible only exceptionally, where permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exemptions shall be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference for open procedures is intended to ensure that restrictions of competition are avoided as far as possible and that opportunities for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) are limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimation of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">In estimating the costs of building projects, contracting authorities in Germany can rely on the budget and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of construction, construction units, construction parts and partial construction works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the contract value of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, it is expected that the database will be extended at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate by the entity financing the project or on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures for standardisation are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the basis of the Anti-Corruption Programme 2011-2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database on customary prices for standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of a price system to determine the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering that the subject-matter of the contract be specified in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a collection of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and to establish unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport constructions for the purpose of their control, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of the preparation of construction works.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation and thus complied with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of civil engineering was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, the share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">The BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of a blanket check, the BRH found, on the basis of information collected from more than 16 000 proceedings, that a restricted procedure has a clear disadvantage compared to a public procedure and a public challenge, and limited procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, the bid prices in the restricted and negotiated procedures were between 6% and 10% higher than in the public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Provincial Audit Court confirmed the differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="327">A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as prices in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total contract value was estimated at more than €5 million (CZK 125 million), the audited contracting authorities usually prepared procurement plans stating which works would be awarded in the European tender and which in the national tender.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the proportion of works awarded under European rules has always exceeded 80% of the total works.</seg>
<seg id="331">There has been no circumvention of the requirement for European management in the form of an exorbitantly low cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases the minimum share for pan-European management was not reached due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of carrying out the works, some contracting entities have illegally amended the contract allocation plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not provide any justification for these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of European proceedings would subsequently be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="335">The proportion of European procedures based on project accounts was generally lower than that provided for in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected contract values of the construction projects exceeded the European limits, the contracting authorities did not use the European procedure for all individual partial parts exceeding €1 million (CZK 25 million).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure without giving valid reasons for the need to derogate from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of the type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. the construction of a road section, facilities for a major sporting event and the construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several lots, although these subcontracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The split reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the estimated price</seg>
<seg id="343">To date, the price standards applicable to road construction projects have not been an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on prices reported in completed proceedings, which were, however, burdened by inefficiencies as well as excessive profits of suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that actual prices for three parts of the ring road were approximately 37% lower than these price standards.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to prices from the past, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For buildings, the projected price was based on the project budget carried out by the architects or on an estimate by the investor.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then differed significantly from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price of the construction of the large library was twice as high as the contractual price, but during the implementation it increased by CZK 54 million, i.e. by 27 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33% lower than the anticipated price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the estimated price and increased further in the course of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">In the case of the construction of a large library, it was by CZK 400 million, i.e. by 22%. In the case of the construction of the palace of justice, the actual price increased disproportionately during the construction (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (by only 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and on respecting European thresholds in their national legislation, so that the respective national regulations of both countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public proceedings in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a restricted procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public call for tenders gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the pool of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives scope for manipulation and price fixing between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech law allows contracting entities to award contracts in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition for contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">The restricted procedure has now come very close to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the requirement of preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition is largely met by contracting entities, while in the Czech Republic some projects have been subdivided in breach of the law in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, for some projects carried out in Germany, the European thresholds were not respected, resulting in a minimum share not being reached in pan-European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, a satisfactory system has not yet been put in place to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive checks, that the requirements for the choice of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met or should create the conditions necessary to allow the correct calculation of expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded under a European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a report on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="369">Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">By means of indicative notices, the contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="372">Prior notices are required for projects where the estimate of the total cost is equal to or greater than the European threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority is obliged to publish a contract notice with detailed information for all public contracts requiring a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">Once published, the information shall be binding on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="375">The notice shall include, inter alia, specifications, time limits for the management and completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common procurement vocabulary must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">In the EU, preliminary information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting entity.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notices at national level are not to contain any additional information and are not to be published before the text of the notice is sent to the Publications Office of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate pre-notification information may distort competition or even facilitate manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully transposed the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">The procurement procedure may not be initiated earlier than one month after dispatch of the indicative notice.</seg>
<seg id="386">Disclosure of prior information may be waived only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, prior information is not required in cases where there is no need for a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the federal government website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted procedures without competition from participants, the notice must be published if the estimated price of the contract is equal to or higher than €25,000 (CZK 625,000).</seg>
<seg id="390">Prior notifications must explain all the planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement in view of the number of small orders in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">The division of projects into smaller parts is not so frequent in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="395">Prior notification</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities published a pre-notice of projects which included works to be awarded under the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they reduced the time limit, although the number of days between the sending of the pre-notice and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other accelerated procedures, the annual time-limits for prior information had expired and should have been renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the pre-notification did not indicate the envisaged division of the works into several parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Contract notices</seg>
<seg id="401">Some notifications contained codes from the common dictionary which deviated from the content of the prior notification or did not specify precisely the work to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="402">In rare cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on deadlines, or were published before a notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting entity hired an external company to publish a national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">It posted a notice on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the sponsor did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to send a notice to a free online government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of the notices were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">SAO</seg>
<seg id="409">Contract notices</seg>
<seg id="410">At the time of the construction of the waste water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not lay down in the contract award notice the criteria according to which it would reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The method of selection (reduction) of tenders for evaluation was not substantiated by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="412">The number of bids was reduced by previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the construction of the ring road, the contracting authority did not define in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documentation the values according to which it will assess the degree of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of tenderers to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority evaluated the fulfilment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the restricted procedure met it, but excluded one of them, saying that it met only the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the sponsor was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on which of the qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of calls</seg>
<seg id="417">In the case of building modifications in former military retreats, the contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to tender in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations/summary</seg>
<seg id="419">A two-stage information process with prior information and the publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements of transparency and strengthening the competitive environment in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Unlike an open procedure, restricted procurement procedures do not allow all potential interested tenderers to participate.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the procuring entity shall first select potential suppliers to be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow limiting the number of candidates in European restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, the restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory and shall be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control so that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting entities should replace the tenderers they invite to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor is it permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three candidates are required to be invited in the restricted procedure and several suitable candidates in the negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="441">With the exception of two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of candidates addressed in the case of a restricted and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the "four-eyes principle" must be respected when selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes a list of candidates, another must substantially modify the list, e.g. by deleting the proposed candidate or by installing another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is intended to avoid a situation in which an individual can definitively determine the pool of candidates to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching illegal collusion between the parties is possible.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers invited to submit a tender must be confidential and must not be divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, there is no similar measure or measure for the confidential treatment of the list of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German provisions, they may not designate candidates from an external company, but may submit proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">Apart from a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of candidates was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7 000 contracts for works with a value up to the national threshold showed that in the case of restricted procedures the contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential bidders and in the case of direct negotiated procedures an average of 4.4 bidders.</seg>
<seg id="456">Switching suppliers and regional constraints</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in the area of building construction, the contracting authorities did not change the range of interviewed bidders because they had good experience with those with whom they had cooperated so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee to approach tenderers whose suitability they had already ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the pool of bidders in the closed procedure included a larger proportion of regional bidders than in the case of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="461">This was explained by the low level of the contract compared to the public tender and the high travel costs for potential bidders.</seg>
<seg id="462">Principle of cross-checking and suggestions of self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">For the most part, contracting authorities ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">They argued in particular that there was a lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of the suitable tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who had proposed the candidate who had been asked to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="466">A check of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was drawn up by self-employed professionals and accepted by the contracting authority without changes.</seg>
<seg id="467">As a result, the contracting authorities did not sufficiently protect themselves against potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of the treatment of lists of potential candidates</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority maintained a list of candidates for invitation to tender in a database to which all staff had access at all times.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of the presumed or accepted bidders, who could then agree on a price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation gave reasons for the selection of candidates only in a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for selecting candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the ring road, candidates did not have information about which of the data on their qualifications would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For the action relating to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the tender notice did not set criteria for limiting the number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight candidates met the qualifications, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority limited participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then selected the tenderers by random selection - by drawing lots - which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">That procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion in the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent the illegal restriction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (four-eyes principle), by keeping the list of candidates confidential and by prohibiting proposals for the selection of candidates to external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit found that a part of the above-mentioned rules was not applied to a sufficient extent and that an inadmissible restriction of the range of candidates was not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contracting authorities are obliged to completely eliminate the mentioned deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase, in which potential tenderers can draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents they have received, begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and/or an invitation to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the date on which the envelopes are opened, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to bid for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting entity must follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and avoid potential tampering.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those provisions relate in particular to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers prepare their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Design offices that are involved in the management should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply information to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices responsible for drawing up the specifications may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Throughout this phase, any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing contact with them may adversely affect competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Tenders submitted electronically must be encrypted.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may instruct insured external service suppliers to print and distribute documentation, and their employees must be bound to observe confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and handed directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official responsible for their safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This worker must have no involvement in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">Tenders received must be locked until the date of opening of the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall issue a report with details of the competition, including the tender number and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no specific rules on the safekeeping of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="512">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="513">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="514">The BRH audited the assignment of the administrative building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Sending procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The audited building administration contracting authorities distributed the tender documentation either directly or commissioned an external company to print and distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="517">The self-employed did not send any documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to tenderers</seg>
<seg id="519">For the questioning and information part of the tender documents, the contracting authority did not follow the separate planning rule from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his liaison officers in the documentation, but rather those of the project management unit.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, candidates who raised questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Marking of quotations</seg>
<seg id="524">For contracting entities, all tenders received were stamped and acknowledged receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, tenders were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-building rule on the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting entity, tenders were temporarily placed in an open mailbox to which all employees had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed the box in the corridor without constant supervision and part of the bids thrown into the box stayed there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">SAO</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices cooperating in the procurement process, throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all candidates.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, the control records collected showed infringements in certain areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These irregularities can easily be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of the envelopes, tenders which have been closed so far are opened, their contents are read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period during which the tenderer is bound by his tender shall begin when the deadline for the submission or opening of the envelopes expires and shall end on the date specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect both bids and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of "more eyes," transparency and credibility of the opening process are intended to prevent the manipulation and modification of tenders already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">Compliance with the "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from secretly manipulating bids.</seg>
<seg id="552">Candidates may be present when opening the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="553">When opening, all envelopes must be placed in front of the Chairman of the Commission and are opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Tenders received late shall not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this stage, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the prizes offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minutes must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The minutes may also be signed by the tenderers present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a commission is established for opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts shall be permitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Members of the Commission may also be entrusted with deliberations in subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting entity.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of building construction, the registrar must not be involved in the preparatory phase (creation of tender documents), must not decide on the award of the contract and must not be a member in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">The German rules require that the minutes of the opening of the envelopes contain not only the bid prices but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, e.g. damaged envelopes on receipt or late tenders.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the tender prices, the minutes must also contain an indication of the tenderer's language and signature authority.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require all parts of opened envelopes to be marked to prevent subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked with a perforation stating the date, must be kept confidential (secret) after the opening of the envelopes and may only be made available to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified without delay.</seg>
<seg id="571">In Germany, they do not have this arrangement and, if a single tender is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="574">Principle of cross-checking</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities followed the four-eyes principle.</seg>
<seg id="576">There was always a supervisor and a recorder who was not assigned another role.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in rare cases, for small negotiated procedures, natural persons have opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Envelope opening progress</seg>
<seg id="579">Envelope-opening notes did not always document progress.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, tenders submitted late were not identified and in some cases signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Marking of incoming bids</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities marked the perforations with a date, which was in line with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Some of them had mislabeled bids in the past, but changed their practice after being warned by the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="584">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="585">SAO</seg>
<seg id="586">Time limit for receipt of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">In the case of road repairs, for one action, the tenderer's tender was transmitted to the contracting authority with a delay of one month and was nevertheless accepted by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">Substantial parts of the provisions for opening envelopes are identical in both countries with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, and thus make it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">The marking, secure storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent amendments to the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the staff responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities connected with the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules on opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the time limit set.</seg>
<seg id="596">It must also award the contract to the tenderer which best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating bids in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to check the suitability of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must be in a good economic and financial position and have the requisite professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Candidates who have ever been finally convicted of bribery or fraud must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Tenders from candidates who have not been eliminated must be evaluated for numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically advantageous tender and in particular examine all significantly low price offers.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be retained in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The outcome of the evaluation may be improperly influenced by the preference or disadvantage of a tenderer, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions when selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of good repute and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They also need to make sure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the examination and evaluation of bids in stages.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for demonstrating the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or in the tender dossier shall not be altered during the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria laid down for assessing the suitability of candidates may no longer be applied.</seg>
<seg id="614">A further evaluation may only be carried out on the basis of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view to ensure that they are complete or do not contain suspicious elements which might encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">Where the evaluation of tenders results in the finding of an unreasonably low tender price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before any elimination of its tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision shall be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, tenderers must observe confidentiality and only authorised persons may participate in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may examine the mathematical accuracy of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only staff who are not involved in the decision-making phase of the selection of the contractor or in the implementation phase of the project may be entrusted with the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">Where external companies are entrusted with the examination and evaluation of tenders, they must be aware that tenders are confidential and respect this fact honestly.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for a decision to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a committee appointed by the contracting authority, which draws up a report proposing the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries the final decision is up to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their tenders must be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to fill in the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the tenderer fails to prove them, he must be expelled.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, it is necessary to examine not only the total price but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">Where the price structure of the tender shows that prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated excessively high or low, tenderers must be asked to explain.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide explanations and if the contracting authority can demonstrate that the tender contains countervailing prices, such tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to the different parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of a work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Valuation compensation is not a reason to exclude a bid.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">Where they are unable to do so, the sponsor should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with unreasonably low prices have been received and the tenderers have not substantiated those prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is substantially higher than the contracting authority's estimate, that does not justify a refusal to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If conduct intended to restrict competition is suspected in Germany, the contracting authority is obliged to notify the competent authority immediately.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter must decide how to proceed and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">They must also approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="650">Examination of suitability and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some self-employed recommendations from potential suppliers, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, insufficient documentation was provided on whether the contracting entity had taken into account all the published evaluation criteria when making the choice or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting entities used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be performed exclusively by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contracting authorities tried to justify this fact by their insufficient human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to examine the offers of services of persons who were not formally bound to respect the confidentiality of tenders and to perform their obligations under the contract with due diligence.</seg>
<seg id="660">As regards contracting authorities, there was generally no conclusive evidence as to whether tenders in the custody of self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Examination and mathematical control of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed examination of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of those examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention to manipulate, third parties could make changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">Examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately identified or where information on prices and products was missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement procedures, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the pre-estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One in 20 procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation of the screening of tenders or of discussions with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was also missing, e.g. on the unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as reasons for the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contracting entities argued that it was difficult to identify and demonstrate countervailing prices.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the circle of ordinary contracting authorities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">Data on closer examination of cost or identification of the reasons for deviations were not recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping by the tenderer to which the contract might have been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the original cost estimate was inflated or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Subsequently, the contracting authority rated the tenderer as a "low-cost company" which was unable to meet either the qualitative requirements or the deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the tendering procedure, arguing that the tenderer could be presumed not to have based its pricing on unreasonably high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting entity and they were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one call for tenders, two tenderers submitted tenders containing identical price calculations, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The checks did not reveal any substantial deficiencies in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction projects, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority specified in the specifications, or did not substantiate qualifications to the required extent, or, conversely, one contracting authority failed to substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of a candidate who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Rating</seg>
<seg id="687">In the case of the construction of a waste water treatment plant, the various evaluation criteria of the tendering procedure were imposed on the contractor, but the contracting authority did not comply with them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For the rail infrastructure development action, the weightings of the evaluation criteria were not set at the start of the procedure when the contract was awarded, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the evaluation of the criterion "reduced construction time" was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For the second and third place bidders, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in construction time than indicated in their bids.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of reasons for candidate selection</seg>
<seg id="692">In the case of three actions connected with housing support, the contracting authority did not demonstrate on the basis of which criteria it assessed the accepted bids and how it selected the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">Correct selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts connected with the construction of a ring road with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand CZK</seg>
<seg id="694">It was not possible to verify the CZK, as the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of performance, but the documents of these negotiations were not prepared.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of tenders comply with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the choice of the individuals involved.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike in the Czech Republic, these steps of the procurement process in Germany are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the fairness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some cases of inspections, it was found that substantial steps in the process of verifying and evaluating tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the examination and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">The inspections showed serious defects, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate screening and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased monitoring of measures against the increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In checking the legitimacy of the prices, the audited German contracting authorities did not in all cases use the full set of tools available and did not look at their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, weaknesses were found in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the use of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">Following the examination and evaluation of tenders, the award process shall be concluded by the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its review where appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The deadline of 10 days applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the outcome of the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement right reviewed by an independent tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting entity will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by implementing procurement decisions quickly.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting entity shall adequately document the progress of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries implemented the management information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily depart from the results of a properly carried out verification and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within a specified period.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is due to the fact that, after this period, the tenderer is not bound by its tender.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed of the outcome in good time, stating the reason why their tender has not been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">Cancellation of the procurement procedure is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not correspond to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of a contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before a decision is taken on its EU provision and review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only one tender meets the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions laid down in the tender dossier and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="735">The audits found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases of European proceedings, companies received empowerment letters before the notification period expired, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also in several cases of open procedures, the empowerment letters contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting entities did not meet the time limits for the award of contracts.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because a bidder offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">During the reconstruction and construction of the university, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor for work in accordance with the draft contract contained in the bid of the selected tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some of the road repair and maintenance actions, the construction of the motorway and the ring road, the contracts were concluded later than provided for by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the case of building modifications in former military retreats, the contracting authority sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers only after the statutory deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented EU rules on the closure of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for contracting was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This may cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings when concluding a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its different stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental requirement of the EU-wide principle of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Appropriate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed reasons for individual decisions and their merits significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the EU Publications Office within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and this fulfils the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the essential details of its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics to provide an overview of the development of the single market in the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the provisions of the European Act on Documentation and Notification Obligations into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for European statistics are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notice period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those mandatory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the limit of €25,000 (CZK 625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 (CZK 375,000) including VAT.</seg>
<seg id="771">Only the parties are informed below that limit.</seg>
<seg id="772">Key control findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of entries have not been fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notification did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for the delivery specifications and national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain the mandatory requirements.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some of the required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="780">In some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in publishing a notice.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of several awards, evidence of publication of the notice was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="782">Notification obligation</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistically examined files included the required minimum of information and were produced and sent in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="784">Prior transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the contracting authority published information on the outcome of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one contracting authority, the contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the sponsor six months to spot the error.</seg>
<seg id="788">Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not published during that period.</seg>
<seg id="789">SAO</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant shortcomings were found in the documentation on the conduct of the procurement procedure, such as incorrect information on bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation committee meetings.</seg>
<seg id="792">Moreover, some of the documents opening the envelopes were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="794">In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, motorway construction and ring roads, public procurement notices were sent after the deadline or were not published.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures the transparency of procurement and final selection procedures.</seg>
<seg id="798">Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.</seg>
<seg id="799">The audits revealed weaknesses substantially reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel audits of the SAO and the BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU with a view to creating a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Prevention measures aim not only to avoid or at least reduce corruption, but also to prevent financial damage and possible losses of confidence in the integrity of government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of both audit institutions - SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of common and different elements that can help both countries in further development and application of this law.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">There is thus an important common basis in both countries for public procurement and the fulfilment of basic requirements in the areas of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting entities reinforce these requirements partly through very far-reaching measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has extended the provisions on public procurement requiring a European procedure to procedures below EU thresholds and is therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, inspections have shown that contracting entities do not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate these inconsistencies, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the audits identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">These include, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the public contract, which resulted in additional works, which were often awarded in breach of the law, the insufficient definition of the expected price, and the required qualifications, which narrow down the possible range of tenderers and thus reduce competition, particularly in the field of transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint inspections did not aim to detect cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that the BRH and the SAO do not have sufficient tools for this.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they may examine whether the competent authorities of both countries take measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">As regards the prevention of corruption, the two countries focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German provisions allow for broad and unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as a central element in the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations aim primarily at strengthening the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRHs</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles on the prevention of corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been included in public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes very precisely, ways of complying with the requirements to prevent corruption during the procurement procedure and to select the persons included in it.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the cross-checking principle), transparency requirements, procurement documentation and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms for preventing corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">The BRH therefore sees no need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting entities should provide further training to their employees in order to make them aware of anti-corruption requirements and to further raise their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the weaknesses revealed relates to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls on the delegation of powers increases the risk of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level, which also significantly affect the area of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO audits took place in the period when one of the most important parts of the strategy was implemented, namely a significant change in the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of related implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The strategy adopted and the new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">According to the new regulations, the contracting authority must, for example, justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the expected value of the public contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualification prerequisites, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluating tenders, and duly document and publish everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, the SAO and the BRH have a favourable opinion of the ways of implementing EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their wide application in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency constitute an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The transnational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential for material and non-material damage incurred as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to the practice in Germany, it has emerged that the proportion of open procurement procedures in the Czech Republic, which give room to competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour, should increase.</seg>
<seg id="848">Procurement in instalments may also have a positive impact on the price obtained, where this is permissible and appropriate for the contracting entity. A higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The organisation of the procurement procedure also has an impact on its progress.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and the BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where appropriate and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for guaranteeing that public contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and honest competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel controls of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint Final Report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>

<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The submitted joint report informs on the course and outcome of international cooperation in parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the performance of parallel audits focused on excise tax administration, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel controls was chosen on the basis of the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at the national level, how the system of excise tax administration is set up and how the systems in Slovakia and the Czech Republic differ.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out consisted in the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practices.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, it was beneficial to note that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise administration is very limited without parallel controls.</seg>

<seg id="18">on the results of parallel inspections of SPD administration in Slovakia and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legal regulation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration is in accordance with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been found between the regulation of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.In the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils and some other oils contribute to the effective administration of excise duties.In the Slovak Republic, the distribution of stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against excise tax evasion, the supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials, the implementation of the fuel distributor institute and the register of retailers of consumer packaging of alcohol have proven to be good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Excise tax revenues in Slovakia and the Czech Republic are growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, among other things because there is no indexation of excise duty rates in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, of reducing the tax burden on excise duties in real terms.</seg>
<seg id="26">The introduction of environmental measures has been financially supported by the State in the long term, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenues, which will therefore need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure spent on the administration of excise duties in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been growing in the long term, mainly due to wage growth, and its effectiveness is declining.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the computerisation of excise tax administration (IT expenditure) and expenditure on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses per alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The e-administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic did not significantly affect the reduction of the number of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend the SAO to reconsider the justification for the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditure was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period that would have led to a reduction in the personnel demands of the excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic was similar in the individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax subjects in the Slovak Republic is about one third lower than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical performance of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">Administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and more costly due to the ratio of the number of tax transactions to the number of entities.</seg>
<seg id="35">Electronic administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise tax returns is fully computerized; in the Czech Republic, documents proving taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of computerization support effective administration of excise taxes and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend their application not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure for the implementation of EMCS could not be compared as FS SR provided data on expenditure only for the upgrade of the system in 2011-2015, but expenditure was still incurred before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenditures spent in this period only on the upgrade of EMCS in Slovakia were approximately 20% higher than those spent in the Czech Republic both on the introduction of EMCS and on the upgrade of this system in more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in Slovakia the administration of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of the electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duty (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but to a lesser extent in Slovakia, as significantly higher expenditures were spent on the implementation and modernisation of the system than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation of the two audit institutions took place on the basis of the Cooperation Agreement in carrying out parallel inspections aimed at the administration of excise duties of 18. 8th 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic agreed to carry out parallel audits, which will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and the results of which will enable analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the established facts.</seg>
<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel controls were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the subject matter and objectives of the parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the parallel checks was to compare the performance of excise administrations, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did the excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has the introduction of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient and has the expenditure to implement it been spent effectively?</seg>
<seg id="52">The parallel audits should have identified the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of legal regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.</seg>
<seg id="53">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The General Directorate of Customs (DG) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (FŘ SR) have joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries, the objectives of this declaration include, among other things, the fight against fraud, exploring the possibility of harmonising legislation and seeking harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, exploring the possibility of joint activities to increase the effectiveness in detecting fraud and sharing experiences and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 The EMCS is operated pursuant to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and monitoring of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of the audit performed by the SAO of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="57">Inspection number: 15/33</seg>
<seg id="58">Subject of the audit: Excise Administration</seg>
<seg id="59">Objective of the audit: The aim of the SAO audit was to examine the procedure of customs authorities in the administration of excise duties, especially in the monitoring of transport in the system of conditional exemption from excise duties and in securing the tax (customs debts); to examine whether the system of excise duties administration is set up in such a way as to ensure the efficiency of the collection of state budget revenues.</seg>
<seg id="60">Inspected period: years 2012-2015 and, in case of relevant connections, previous and subsequent periods</seg>
<seg id="61">Controlled entity: Directorate-General for Customs</seg>
<seg id="62">Identification of the audit carried out by the SAO SR</seg>
<seg id="63">Inspection number: KA-023/2016/1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Subject of the audit: Excise Administration</seg>
<seg id="65">Objective of the audit: The aim of the audit was to independently and objectively examine whether the FS SR and the Customs Offices (CA) were operating economically, effectively and efficiently in accordance with generally binding legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="66">Audited period: years 2012-2015</seg>
<seg id="67">Audited entity: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">The legislation on the administration of excise duties is divided into EU legislation (see Annex 1) and national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines the excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the administration of taxes and the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This Directive makes it possible to levy taxes on consumption on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">In particular, EU legislation regulates minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for individual types of selected products, the production, storage, processing and holding of taxable products, the chargeability of tax, tax exemptions and refunds, the supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the maintenance of registers of economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation allows for control procedures and institutes at national level, provided that they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Excise Tax Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, the regulation of excise duties is concentrated in the Act on Excise Duties (Act No.353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of the tax on mineral oils, the tax on alcohol, the tax on tobacco products, the tax on beer, the tax on wine and intermediate products and the tax on crude tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="77">This Act defines the forms of treatment of products subject to excise duties, the tax payer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for the transport of products, the tax declaration and the penalties for breach of legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="78">The Act and related decrees further regulate certain other conditions for the disposal of mineral oils (labelling of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and the storage of crude tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No.261/2007 Coll., on the Stabilization of Public Budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are contained in special legislation. Fuel Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulate the conditions for the sale, dispensing, distribution of fuel and keeping records of fuel put into free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">61/1997 Coll., on alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No.307/2013 Coll., on mandatory labelling of alcohol, and the relevant implementing regulations stipulate mandatory labelling of alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for handling control tapes and conditions for handling alcohol (i.e. for the manufacture, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, acceptance, use, possession, import or export of ethyl alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">Procedures in tax proceedings, which are not specified in special regulations, are regulated by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Sanctions are imposed in accordance with the procedures of Act No. 500/2004 Coll., Code of Administrative Procedure.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for the issuance of a trade licence (concession) for the pursuit of a trade, namely the production and processing of fuels and lubricants and the distribution of fuels, and the production, treatment and sale of fermentation alcohol, alcoholic beverages and spirits, are governed by Act No.455/1991 Coll., on Trade Licensing (Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has made use of the authority to establish control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to supervise compliance with legal regulations in the handling of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as in the handling of selected products for which tax has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These include monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and crude tobacco, labelling of certain other mineral oils, labelling of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic made use of the right to apply excise duty to other products and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">On the basis of the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 No. 735, to implement the "zero tolerance plan for the black market in spirits," major legislative adjustments were made in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, introducing a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on spirits.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were also fundamental changes in the legal regulation of the tax on mineral oils, the tax on tobacco products and the criminalisation of the preparation of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="92">Protection of tax revenue by criminal law</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective from 1. 7th In 2016, the criminalisation of the preparation of a crime - the reduction of tax, fee and similar compulsory payment - was introduced. The modification should enable police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. the deployment of operative means of investigation.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions for the administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="95">The issuance of a permit for the disposal of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is effective from 1 January 2013. 1st 2015 subject to: reliability; non-debt; economic stability; authorization to conduct a trade enabling the performance of an activity related to the permit; a situation where the petitioner is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of tax arrears by reducing entities authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability newly allows the tax administrator to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both in the permitting procedure and after the permit is issued.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent operators who do not have sufficient financial resources to properly discharge their tax obligations from disposing of the selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">In order to assess the economic stability of the proposer, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax administrator depends on the individual conditions of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Act stipulates the periodicity of the verification of the fulfilment of the condition of economic stability due to the up-to-dateness of the data - the verification takes place once a year in connection with the deadline for filing income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax administrator also has the possibility to set other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the permit holder does not meet the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the permit or cancel it with a delay.</seg>
<seg id="104">Of the total number of 2,609 entities for which the Czech Customs Administration examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of tax security (e.g. repeated recipient).</seg>
<seg id="105">The permit was revoked for ten entities, the other applicants increased the security of the tax, capitalized their contribution to the company or documented current accounting data, according to which they already fulfilled all the conditions for issuing the permit.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the applicant, the conditions of reliability and debt-free status must also be met by a natural person who is a statutory body or its member, or by a natural person who, although not a statutory body of the applicant or its member, carries out this activity (a chain of legal persons in the capacity of a statutory body or its member, so-called connected entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 associated entities had been screened.</seg>
<seg id="108">Records kept pursuant to the Excise Tax Act (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) contain information on:</seg>
<seg id="109">the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, received, delivered or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment (suspension arrangement, import, reintroduction, export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">the SEED ID of the consignee or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of occurrence of the event and the entry in the register;</seg>
<seg id="111">transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carrier, transport number);</seg>
<seg id="112">the registration numbers of the related documents;</seg>
<seg id="113">notification of the release for free fiscal circulation of ethyl alcohol in immediate packaging marked with a control band and details of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="114">A record of receipt after transport must be made without delay after its completion.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of records kept electronically, the records must be kept or allow output in the format xls, xlsx, ods.</seg>
<seg id="116">Ethyl alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a set of measures aimed at ensuring a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, Diagram A) from the production of raw alcohol through the labelling with control tape to its distribution to the final seller or the authorised user of exempt alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, the production facility for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation, is also subject to supervision by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the handling of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure permanent supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are: Records of production, intake, stocks and issue of alcohol contain information on the quantity of alcohol according to the individual stages of production and processing of alcohol with the document numbers.</seg>
<seg id="121">Restrictions on the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and the number of packages with broken control tape at the point of final sale or release to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging with a capacity of max. one litre or three litres if the container is made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Prepackaged spirit drinks shall be considered as unlabelled and prohibited to be disposed of.</seg>

<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has set up a comprehensive supervisory system (see Annex 3, Diagram B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty are subject, but also selected mineral oils not subject to excise duty which have been misused for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil through storage, transport, labelling and colouring of selected mineral oils, labelling of certain other mineral oils up to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">Customs supervision includes the manufacture of markers for the marking and handling of mineral oils.</seg>

<seg id="162">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils, which are a group of mineral oils under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion) whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and having at least one of the following characteristics: the flash point is less than 150 °C, at least 20 per cent of the volume is distilled during the distillation test, including losses up to 350 °C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils were misused as admixtures in finished fuels, in particular diesel, or were directly used or sold to power engines, as the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres must register with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="167">For the issue of registration must be fulfilled the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative, which applies throughout 2 Except for beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.</seg>

<seg id="180">As in the case of failures to fulfil obligations in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration as a fuel distributor is compulsory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Only persons meeting the following criteria may be registered fuel distributors:</seg>
<seg id="183">Mandatory Trade Licensing Office concession (specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The opinion on the application for a concession and, where appropriate, on the appointment of a responsible representative shall be given by the customs office, which shall examine whether the applicant for a concession, the statutory body or members of the statutory body of the applicant-legal person and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">If these persons fulfil the condition of reliability, the customs office shall give a favourable opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person is a person of good repute in terms of criminal property, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">Professional competence is a condition for the award of the concession.</seg>
<seg id="188">Debtlessness of the same group of persons as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">A debt-free person is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will properly and timely discharge his payment obligations towards the State, i.e. does not have arrears to the state budget and general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">A fuel distributor may not be prohibited by a court or an administrative authority from carrying out an activity which renders his activity impossible.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fuel distributor shall not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>

<seg id="196">The claim for a refund of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">Reimbursement of excise duty on mineral oils may be claimed only in respect of an activity which is clearly linked to an activity carried out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were approximately 64,000 claims for tax refunds in the total amount of CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e. €43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the Government of the Czech Republic has also introduced a refund of fuel excise duty to livestock farmers.</seg>
<seg id="200">Farmers or breeders who, for example, are engaged in cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will now be able to exercise this right.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products at the old rate of duty</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term under-achievement of budgeted revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced, with effect from 1. 12. 2014 restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate in the event of a change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on manufactured tobacco shall be paid by the use of tobacco labels.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco label means placing it on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Duty Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">The manufacture of a tobacco product in a condition intended for the final consumer shall be decisive for the application of the rate of excise duty and need not be removed from storage, delivered, dispatched or sold or sold to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet characterising the excise duty rate appears on the tobacco label together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, and the label indicates the number of items in the package or the quantity of smoking tobacco in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">The tobacco label has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the resale of ready-to-eat unit packets of cigarettes bearing a tobacco label with the previous (old) tax rate was fixed until the last day of the second calendar month following the entry into force of the new excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">The development of the collection of tobacco labels in 2014 and the comparison with the development in previous years show that manufacturers of tobacco products significantly frontloaded each year with tobacco products with the "old" tax rate, effectively delaying the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Tax on raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the manufacture of tobacco products without the authorisation of the tax authority and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as anti-tax fraud measures.</seg>
<seg id="213">Effective from 1. 7th 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, has been delivered to another Member State or a third country or for which the origin, purpose or person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved shall be subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on the disposal of raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as the supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, the marking of unit packets with a control tape and restrictions on sales at designated locations have been supplemented by restrictions on the disposal of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">Manufacturing establishments for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or processed.</seg>
<seg id="218">The registered person may only be a person meeting the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative, which applies throughout the registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions of registration are: a) authorization to conduct a trade enabling the performance of the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, b) reliability, c) debt-free, d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been banned from carrying out his activity, e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, f) provision of a security deposit of CZK 20 000 000 (i.e. about €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="220">The electronic register shall contain the date of receipt or delivery of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the trading partner, the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be given to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours before receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">The details of the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of use and the details of the carrier shall be reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">Notification of the estimated quantity of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the year concerned shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the calendar year concerned.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications shall be submitted electronically by data box in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco shall be accompanied by a document with the prescribed particulars.</seg>
<seg id="226">Excise tax legislation in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating the area of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its unified tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Individual types of excise duties are exhaustively determined by the legislation of the Slovak Republic, which is similar to the legislation of neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="230">The legislative regulation of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to the individual subjects of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonization was achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No. 98/2004 Coll., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No. 106/2004 Coll., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No. 530/2011 Coll., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No. 609/2007 Coll., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All laws on excise duties constitute provisions of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No. 563/2009 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework transposed the individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC and transposed the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European Community.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, the legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several fundamental changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS system, the monitoring of the transport of selected excise products under suspension of excise duty has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where these transports are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">As part of the electronic EMCS system, the suspension of tax subjects" access to the EMCS was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The Customs Office has the possibility to suspend access precisely in the event of a well-founded fear of an unpaid or undetermined tax from previous tax periods and its unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This concerns the payment of the tax, since the movement of excise goods requires the lodging of security, which is released by the termination of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A fundamental change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the option to use so-called red diesel was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">Designated gas oil, also commonly called red diesel, was a mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific statutory purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of the abolition of red diesel was to reduce the public deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden on the business entities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel retailer.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this statutory amendment was to introduce an obligation to keep records for all petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The clarification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">New institutes of tax subjects, namely fuel distributor and fuel consumer, were introduced in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="252">This amendment has contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and has made the movement of these fuels clearer (see Annex 4, Figure A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">In Slovakia, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to be labelled with an indicator substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on manufactured tobacco</seg>
<seg id="256">As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Materials Act was extended and a new tax entity - a trader in tobacco raw materials - was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movements are not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, an obligation to register technological facilities for the manufacture of tobacco products has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The control mark shall refer to cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the purchaser of stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of stamps electronically, through the stamp collection information system.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax subject and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state stamp printer was established in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system of printing stamps strengthens the system of control of goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the stamp to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">Unique 12-digit identification number (1.ç2. place is a checksum; 3rd place is whether the code belongs to a checkmark or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th place is 8th place. place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9. place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes must also indicate the price of the cigarettes, the sign indicating the validity of the rate of excise duty, the number of cigarettes in the consumer pack and the length of the cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three provisions of substantive law were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The Act was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxing alcoholic beverages, addressing their production, monitoring movements, securing the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline the performance of tax administration, and reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">The new way of dealing with the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a uniform rate of excise duty on an alcoholic beverage and took into account the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="273">For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The beer concentration shall also be expressed as a percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household in quantities of not more than 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the purchaser of stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of stamps electronically, through the stamp collection information system.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax subject and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state stamp printer was established in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Diagram B) and the elimination of falsification of postage stamps.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system of printing stamps strengthens the system of control of goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the stamp to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">Unique 12-digit identification number (1.ç2. place is a checksum; 3rd place is whether the code belongs to a checkmark or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th place is 8th place. place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9. place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common Act No.353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">The tax on solid fuels, the tax on natural gas and certain other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In contrast, in the Slovak Republic, each excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the Act on Excise Duty on Alcoholic Beverages, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic is from 1. 1st 2015 the issuance of a permit to deal with products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is subject, among other things, to the proof of applicants" economic stability, which the customs authorities verify annually by conducting a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the Slovak Republic, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding on the waiver or reduction of the tax security.</seg>
<seg id="292">FF SR performs tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of stamps for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in a printing works and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of stamps is ensured by the state-owned company Mincovna Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco labels and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not supervised by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken from the printer by the authorized territorial office of the Customs Office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco labels are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, control tapes for alcohol marking are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">Czech legislation does not define manufacturers of tobacco labels and control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Slovakia there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its part, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco label carries excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when tobacco labels are collected from the authorized customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">In Slovakia, on the other hand, the stamp does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the audited period in the case of their use for primary agricultural crop production, the so-called green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In Slovakia, such support for farmers is not in place (it existed until 31.12.2008). 12. 2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of CZK 20 million (i.e. €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors was reduced from 1 891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">In Slovakia, a similar institute of fuel distributor is in place, but without the deposit needed to secure excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">There were 303 registered distributors in Slovakia in 2014 and 407 registered distributors in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In Slovakia, there is an institute of fuel sellers and fuel consumers, which is licensed by the locally competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils are subject to labelling; in Slovakia, after the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the control tape for the marking of alcohol contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and a twelve-digit registration code indicating the spirit content of the spirit drink, according to which the control tapes are kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape shall notify their use within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the Slovak Republic, a control stamp intended for the marking of alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax administrator and serves to verify the authenticity of the control stamp.</seg>
<seg id="315">The records contain the number of collected, used and claimed control marks.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of alcohol distributors.</seg>
<seg id="317">In Slovakia, registration is subject to the fulfilment of conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least €100,000 or paid-up registered capital of at least €100,000; minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is subject, among other things, to a deposit of CZK 5 000 000 (i.e. 185 000 €) for the benefit of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In Slovakia, the permanent presence of the tax administrator is required for the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of a person obliged to label alcohol with the condition of lodging a deposit for the benefit of the tax administrator in the amount of CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) up to £5,000,000 (i.e. 185 000 €) depending on the amount of control tapes taken and the installation of a tracking device with continuous access by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia greatly exceeds the minimum EU requirements for the subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as to risks identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrators to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw materials (e.g. leaves), an excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials was introduced in addition to EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although neither raw tobacco nor tobacco raw material is a harmonised tobacco product, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia monitor their movements.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic may recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability of applicants for permits under the Excise Tax Act has proved successful because it reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such audits also under the conditions of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="330">Distribution of stamps is more efficient in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with costs related to transport between the printing works and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco labels.</seg>
<seg id="331">The financial administration of the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the existence and location of technological facilities for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more effective, because the ordering of the tobacco label itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">The financial administration in Slovakia has a better overview of fuel sales points thanks to the introduction of the "fuel seller" and "fuel consumer" institutes.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of mandatory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic enables simpler control of misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014) a new control tape or stamp containing an identification code was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in Slovakia the new legislation has waived its inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="337">It is not yet possible to evaluate the impacts due to the short effectiveness of the legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic may recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The position of the Slovak Republic on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterized by a pro-client approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive, because it introduces a deposit burdening tax subjects" cash flow, but it reduces the risk of tax arrears more.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of excise tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State in order to increase the revenue of the State budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to individuals and/or society (regulatory function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Commission Communication: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3. 3rd 2010 under the Resource Efficient Europe flagship initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including through a revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should endeavour to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxation, among others, as part of a greater "greening" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">Collection of excise tax revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes collection of excise tax on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP is monitored, among other things, by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both SAIs used the following selection criteria to enter the query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties in connection with macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP declined slightly according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">To convert amounts in CZK to € at 31. On the 12th of the relevant year, the ECB rate of the European Central Bank was used.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against the euro in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25.140 to 27.425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of excise duty collection, excise duty rates and income per capita in euro decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant decrease in the share of excise duties in 2014 was caused by a one-off shortfall in excise revenues from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting sales of tobacco products with the old tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also affected by growth in income tax collection, which increased significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">Excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share in the total collection of excise duties (approximately 55.7% in 2015), but this declined despite significant growth in the economy compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as an anti-tax fraud measure.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels have a negative impact on the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">Natural gas, solid fuel and electricity taxes account for a negligible share, due to the low tax rate, which is close to the EU minimum rates, compared to neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the absence of an increase in rates, their share will decrease in the future in view of the ever decreasing energy intensity of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale case of tax fraud involving the introduction of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a number of measures against such behaviour and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the 2012 collection by €4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of the tax on tobacco products increased as a result of increasing rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duties changed between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on tobacco products, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in euro, excluding the tax on tobacco products, fell significantly. It rose only slightly for tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or the standard of living, the indexation of the excise duty rate is not set, so the function of excise duties to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">As the Czech Republic's economic growth and living standards rise, real excise tax rates are declining.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation - an automatic adjustment of an economic variable for inflation, based on a law or contract (in the case of state-paid income, this is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties in connection with macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="371">The current legislative regulation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic does not address the indexation of excise duty rates to consumer price developments, as they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all excise duties introduced in Slovakia, the excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the full-year tax revenues of the state budget, while its share did not fall below 52% in the whole audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">Excise duty on tobacco products accounts for the second largest share.</seg>
<seg id="378">On average, this tax accounts for around 32% of the total excise collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, the collection of excise duty per capita of the Slovak Republic increased.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to the rise in excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth of excise duty collection per capita of the Slovak Republic is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in euro per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention regarding the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is approximately 2.7 and 2.8 times higher in the Czech Republic respectively, but per capita of the Czech Republic the collection for these selected products is only about 1/3 higher.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK against € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">In the case of the mineral oil tax, the cause is also greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of the tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a significant impact.</seg>
<seg id="387">Assessment Real excise duty rates in the Czech Republic were falling as a result of the CNB's interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the achieved levels of the excise duty ratio are consistently above the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The total collection of excise duties is influenced mainly by a change in excise duty rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures subsidised by the State in various forms will have to be compensated by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="392">By not introducing the indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their regulatory functions are reduced and the EU's objectives of a Europe less dependent on environmentally unfriendly sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco are insufficiently supported.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic reflects higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by a lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure on excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of income (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of the tax administrator in the administration of the tax is influenced by the competence and organizational arrangement of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of computerization of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The determination of the efficiency of the administrative costs of tax administration using the conversion factor method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a linearly managed structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out in addition to other activities by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is an independent organisational unit of the state and an accounting unit.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the administration of the tax is ensured by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs administration is an internal organisational unit, the costs and revenues are included cumulatively for the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of excise tax administration, expenditures and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">Administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative acts performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial inspections are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">Excise duty administration is mainly carried out by the following departments:</seg>
<seg id="406">Directorate-General for Customs</seg>
<seg id="407">Department 23 TAXATION</seg>

<seg id="433">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="434">Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic from 1. 1st 2012 has undergone a difficult transition process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The establishment of the FS SR was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly established departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the context of the exercise of excise duties, the activities related to the administration of excise duties within the FSB organisational structure were integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.</seg>
<seg id="437">Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Tax Section FŘ SR Department of Excise Duties (all-Slovak competence):</seg>
<seg id="438">Guide and coordinate activities in the field of excise administration; draw up expert opinions; submit proposals and comments on legislative amendments; issue decisions on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax subjects; assign and cancel registration collection numbers;</seg>

<seg id="444">the Excise Remedies Unit shall review the decisions of the customs authorities on the basis of the ordinary and extraordinary remedies applied; the appeal procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="445">The Customs Section was created in the course of 2012; it directly integrated the various Customs Offices (9 Customs Offices), which have territorial competence determined by higher territorial units, with the exception of one Customs Office, which was set up, inter alia, to carry out tasks related to the external border of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">Excise tax department - the performance of methodological activities in relation to branches of customs offices and stations of customs offices; for selected entities, the tax administrator performs direct acts, i.e. decides on registration (tax warehouse, authorised recipient repeated, registered consignor), on the amount of tax security, determines and refunds tax, performs tax supervision and tax control; decides on the waiver of tax security; decides on the waiver of the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in the tax warehouse on alcohol;</seg>
<seg id="448">Legal department - decision-making activities in relation to tax infringements; activities related to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax execution proceedings;</seg>
<seg id="449">the branch of the customs office decides on the registration (with the exception of the tax warehouse, the authorised consignee for readmission, the registered consignor), the amount of tax security; prescribes and refunds the tax; carries out tax supervision and tax control; decides on the security and forfeiture of the goods;</seg>
<seg id="450">station of the customs office - exercising tax supervision over the holding and movement of excise goods; ensuring the performance of permanent tax supervision in a tax warehouse for alcohol; deciding on the security and forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">Expenditures of the Slovak tax administration on excise administration are steadily increasing as, with the exception of wage growth, investments in effective tax administration and the computerisation of financial administration are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although excise revenues increased, expenditure increased faster as a result of the IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure in the Slovak Republic is significantly influenced by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses per alcohol, which the Czech Republic does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on excise tax administration between 2012 and 2015 increased more significantly in 2015, this growth was caused mainly by growth in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties rose at approximately the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Compared to the Slovak Republic, wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by broader competences of the customs administration, e.g. weighing of trucks, control of fulfilment of obligations in connection with tolls.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly worsening trend year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenses per employee increased.</seg>
<seg id="459">Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditures per employee grew more slowly than in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wage growth is a significant factor in the worsening efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be assessed as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in the administration of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, as confirmed by the non-decreasing number of employees in the excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="463">In Slovakia, however, the administration of excise duties with lower revenues is significantly more demanding on staffing capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of excise tax administration</seg>
<seg id="465">Excise administration is a set of activities aimed at correctly determining, determining and securing the payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration of activities, supervision of transport, control and tracing of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="467">The number of administrative acts and managed entities are indicators of the tax administrator's performance.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the monitored indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the efficiency of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Licences and registration for activities are essential prerequisites for the handling of selected products for commercial purposes and their transport under suspension of tax.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to perform continuous administration for entities with a permit or registration, with a focus on supervising the fulfilment of legal regulations and conditions set by the tax administrator, for which adequate personnel resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The indicator monitored was the number of permits or registrations in force at 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of authorisations or registrations issued is not the same as the number of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in a case.</seg>
<seg id="474">The monitored administrative acts are the most significant acts of the tax administrator (tax confirmation, transport administration in the EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of acts culminating in a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Licence and registration to operate in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">Selected products may be produced, processed, stored, received or dispatched on the basis of a tax administrator's permission to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">Where the tax warehouse operator has several warehouses, the authorisation shall be issued separately for each warehouse, including the securing of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. physical presence of the official and securing the equipment with the conclusions of the tax administrator).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">The tax warehouse operator is also registered for tax pursuant to Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">Permission to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products conditionally exempt from tax from the place of import to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to a place of export in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replaces the status of registered consignor under Art. Article 4 (2) 10 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include tax-free permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.</seg>
<seg id="485">Growing distilleries produce alcohol at a reduced 50% tax rate (CZK 14,300/hl ethanol) - fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the permit to operate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced rate of tax may be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of the grower for personal consumption during the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The cultivation firing register kept by the operators of the distiller and made available to the tax authorities must contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate dispensed, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">The authorised consignee for the repeated acceptance of selected products and the authorised consignee for the single acceptance of selected products shall be entitled, on the basis of the authorisation of the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to receive once or repeatedly selected products under the conditional system shipped from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The authorised consignee is not a tax warehouse operator and may not store or dispatch selected products under suspension arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of selected tax-exempt products is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or sells selected tax-exempt products to another user pursuant to Section 52a or Section 53 of Act No.353/2003 Coll.; users have the status of tax subjects without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">Selected exempt products may be received and used only on the basis of a final authorisation and only from the supplier specified in the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of an authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of an authorisation for use or to a user authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Exempt mineral oils may be sold without authorisation in cases provided for by law, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if produced by the user himself or in the course of his activities,</seg>
<seg id="495">selected exempt mineral oils in unit packs of not more than 20 litres intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production and at the same time intended for sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">Selected exempt products may be transported with proof of exemption.</seg>
<seg id="497">After mandatory registration with the tax administrator, the distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled to sell or otherwise transfer alcohol put into free tax circulation.</seg>

<seg id="500">On the basis of the issued concession and the registration of the tax administrator, the fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel on the territory of the Czech Republic under specified conditions, with the exception of the sale of fuel from a petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="501">The transport of fuel must be accompanied by a tax document, a sales document or a transport document, or a distribution plan and bottling tickets.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent to the tax authorities before the start of transport.</seg>
<seg id="503">The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where, by permission of the Building Authority, the sale or dispensing of fuel is usually allowed to the fuel tank.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators broken down into: registered - ordinary sale or dispensing of fuel usually to the fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined approach - operating usually in various company premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, construction yards), the sale is carried out for the other party only on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel dispensing points only for the own consumption of operators.</seg>
<seg id="506">A service station is not a construction or installation in the form of an operational tank located in service (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is dispensed for own use only.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operational tanks are not subject to the tax administrator's permission and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free tax circulation for resale on the basis of the tax administrator's permission.</seg>
<seg id="509">They must also be authorised to purchase or obtain liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative acts in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">A tax audit is a set of actions. The subject of the tax audit are tax obligations, claims of the tax subject or other circumstances relevant for the correct identification and determination of the tax relating to one tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="512">A tax audit may be carried out jointly for several tax proceedings of a single tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">Repeated tax inspections may be carried out only under the conditions and justification laid down by law when the inspection is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tax audit is carried out within the time limit for determining the tax, which is three years, and the time limit is extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, initiating criminal proceedings in connection with the tax in question) or suspended (court proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The period for determining the tax shall expire no later than ten years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">The tax administrator is not obliged to carry out a tax inspection of each tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">Initiation of the tax audit imposes deadlines for the possibility of filing an additional tax return or an additional accounting by the tax subject (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the period for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">Its result may lead to an ex officio assessment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administrator searches for evidence and conducts an inspection of premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging at tax entities and other persons involved in tax administration, on a place outside the tax administrator's premises (e.g. at a tax entity, at a point of sale, on the way to transport).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and items, to take samples or to secure them.</seg>
<seg id="521">On the basis of the outcome of the local investigation, it is not possible to assess the tax separately, but the tax subject may be required to file an additional tax return (§ 145 para. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">The EMCS traffic data check is not a local survey.</seg>
<seg id="523">Only a registered person obliged to label alcohol can place an order for control strips for alcohol marking to the tax administrator of the locally competent place of marking and it is carried out by means of intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the register of alcohol markers.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the quantity of control tapes ordered and orders the production.</seg>
<seg id="525">It does not supervise the production of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">The production is provided by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">The purchaser of the control tapes receives the control tapes from the tax authority of the locally competent place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="528">The order of tobacco labels for the marking of cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco fulfils the function of a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco label corresponds to the amount of tax liability, while the purchaser of the tobacco labels is obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their collection from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate the value corresponding to the tax liability of the ordered tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period shall only apply if the value of the tobacco labels is assured.</seg>
<seg id="532">Tobacco stickers are ordered on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance in writing or via a data box with the possibility of using intelligent forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco labels is ensured by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorized tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (territorial office Kutná Hora), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, who distributes them and further examines their transport, storage and use at customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include regular tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco labels, filed by taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="536">Tax declarations under customs procedure on the basis of customs declarations and declarations of claims for refunds on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrols used in the course of business activities other than for the production of heat or the propulsion of engines, mineral oils used for primary agricultural production are not included.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with the infringements found, which are a series of consecutive administrative actions. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes the form of: requests for administrative cooperation, replies to requests for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, event reports, inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport carried out under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech Customs Office is the tax administrator of the receiving or dispatching tax warehouse or the authorised recipient.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="540">Licence and registration to operate in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="541">Administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is ensured mainly by customs offices and the Department of Excise Duties of the Customs and Tax Department of the Slovak Republic, whose procedure for administering excise duties is regulated by individual laws on excise duties and the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws stipulate not only the scope of authorization for CA and FC SR in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax subjects (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was caused by an increase in issued permits within tax warehouses, an increase in registrations of an authorised recipient for re-acceptance and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation clarified the transport of certain mineral oils in bulk, as well as the notification obligation if they are transported in bulk or in packaging of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to inspection and transport procedure to include other goods such as anti-knock products, oxidation inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, viscosity improvers, anti-corrosion products.</seg>
<seg id="545">A mandatory indication concerning the indication of their kinematic viscosity has been introduced for lubricating oils.</seg>
<seg id="546">An approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic is given in the following parts of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Within the framework of the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a tax warehouse operator within the scope of all subjects of excise duties, a person who wishes to operate a tax warehouse must also apply for registration and issuance of a permit to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is a certificate of registration for the relevant excise tax, by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CA issues a permit for the operation of a tax warehouse, which entitles the tax warehouse operator to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="551">If the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in more places, the tax administrator will issue a separate permit for each tax warehouse to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The transport of the subject of excise duty under suspension of excise duty is monitored electronically through the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each shipment.</seg>
<seg id="554">ARC code under which the transport can be monitored on-line and thus in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the tax warehouse operator is also a person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the date of its release.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">A registered consignor is a special type of tax entity which cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator, even if it dispatches the subject of excise duty under a duty suspension arrangement after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Within the framework of the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a registered consignor in the context of all subjects of excise duties, a person who wishes to dispatch an item of excise duty under the conditional exemption regime after its release under the "free circulation" procedure must also apply to the CA for registration and issuance of a permit to dispatch the item of excise duty under this procedure.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time also issues an authorisation to dispatch the subject of excise duty under the duty suspension regime after its release for the "free circulation" customs procedure.</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing distiller</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of the distillery is obtaining a permit for the production of alcohol in the distillery from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, a licence from the Ministry alone does not entitle the holder of a licence to operate a distillery.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order to operate a distillery, a person must submit an application to the CA for registration and issue of a certificate of registration of a distillery operator.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which also entitles the operator of the distillery to produce alcohol in the distillery.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of the distillery is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Growing distilleries cannot be tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislator allows a reduced tax rate of 50% of the basic tax rate, i.e. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced rate of tax shall be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in a growing distiller in quantities of not more than 43 litres a year per grower and per household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from 1. 7 of the current year to 30. 6 the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year, and therefore it is possible to apply a reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced several times within one calendar year, because the alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This is the production of ethyl alcohol outside the duty suspension scheme, which means in practice that the ethyl alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays not only excise duty and value added tax for the alcohol produced, but also the price for the services rendered.</seg>
<seg id="573">The growing distiller shall issue a removal certificate to the grower, which shall serve not only as proof of the origin and method of acquisition of the ethyl alcohol but also as proof of payment of the excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of alcohol produced in this way is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of consumer packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country and put it into free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of consumer packaging shall not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA shall issue him with a confirmation of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate authorises the importer to import consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing stamps, he must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the tax attributable to the quantity of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes which he wishes to put into free fiscal circulation.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of consumer packaging must release for free tax circulation only consumer packaging marked with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="581">To that end, they must submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the stamps exported to the territory of a non-member country.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer shall have the number of stamps reimported from the territory of a non-member country certified by the customs office of importation.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds in accordance with the customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">Where consumer packaging is released for free fiscal circulation, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the importer of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol is also a person authorized to distribute ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to notify the CA electronically of the trade name of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the day of its release.</seg>
<seg id="587">Vendor of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person wishing to hold a permit to sell must apply to the CA for a permit and fulfil the legal conditions (trade licence; good repute in relation to intentional economic crimes; his permit to sell has not been withdrawn for ten years; he is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As this concerns consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, an invoice which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation is sufficient to prove the method of obtaining the consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="592">The licence holder is obliged to keep for each establishment a calendar month a record of the number of items of consumer packaging of alcohol, the number of items of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol as of the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of consumer packaging of alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The licence holder is obliged to purchase alcohol in consumer packaging or otherwise obtain it in the course of business activities only from the person authorised to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislature introduced a new tax institute as a distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person wishing to hold a distribution licence must apply to the CA for a distribution licence.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must fulfil the legal conditions (trade licence for a trade; storage area exceeds 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of spirits of at least €100,000 or paid-up registered capital of at least €100,000; minimum number of 10 employees; no arrears with the customs office; no arrears on compulsory levies; good repute in relation to intentional economic crimes; no licence to sell has been withdrawn for ten years; no liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As this concerns consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, an invoice which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation is sufficient to prove the method of obtaining the consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="600">The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to keep, for each establishment, a calendar month record of the number of received items of consumer packaging of alcohol, the number of issued items of consumer packaging of alcohol, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol as of the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of received and issued consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of a distribution authorisation is obliged to purchase alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorised to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorised to distribute shall notify the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Fuel Seller</seg>
<seg id="604">In order to monitor fuels in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, namely a fuel vendor.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation governing petrol stations in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="606">Therefore, petrol stations are incorporated into the national legislation of the Slovak Republic as fuel retailers.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person wishing, in the course of a business activity in the tax territory, to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation is required, before the start of the sale, to apply to the CA for a licence to sell and to produce a document proving that the storage facility is verified and equipped with suitable certified measuring equipment enabling the quantity of mineral oil to be measured at reception and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">Where the fuel vendor is a tax warehouse operator, an authorised consignee or a registered consignor, the CA shall also issue an authorisation for the sale of fuel to automatically registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">In addition to other legal obligations, the fuel seller is obliged to keep records of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG per calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CA of the new fuel supplier (distributor).</seg>
<seg id="610">A fuel vendor is required by law to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As these are fuels in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when delivering fuel through a tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottle from a measuring device installed in the tanker when refuelling the dealer.</seg>
<seg id="613">That document shall contain, in addition to the quantities, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax administrator, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="615">When exercising tax supervision over mineral oils, the tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="616">First of all, this is an attempt to avoid roadside checks during transport, which is why hauliers use secondary roads, circumventing the toll collection system in order to make it more difficult to monitor actual transport operations.</seg>
<seg id="617">Transports of mineral oils are also carried out in converted double-bottomed tanks.</seg>
<seg id="618">It is often the case that illegal transport is accompanied by a vehicle which reports possible mobile patrols to hauliers in order to change their route and avoid roadside checks.</seg>
<seg id="619">Fuels are also mixed with light fuel oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel Distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">In order to monitor fuel in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced, namely the fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person intending to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in free tax circulation in the tax territory in the course of a business activity shall, before the start of the distribution, apply to the customs office for a distribution permit and submit a document proving that the storage facility is verified and equipped with appropriate certified measuring equipment, as well as a list of suppliers and purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="623">In addition to other legal obligations, the fuel distributor is obliged to keep separate records of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG per calendar month for each establishment.</seg>
<seg id="624">The fuel distributor is required by law to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">A fuel distributor may sell in the tax territory only to a fuel distributor, a registered person or a consumer of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when fuel is delivered through a tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottle from a measuring device installed in the tanker when refuelling the fuel dealer or consumer of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="627">That document shall contain, in addition to the quantities, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="628">As these are fuels in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">An invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor or registered person assigned by the tax administrator, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="630">Fuel consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">The fuel consumer has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases, for his own consumption, petrol, diesel or LPG in the tax territory and stores that mineral oil in a storage facility with a capacity of 15 000 litres or more shall notify the customs office at the latest before the first placing in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">The customs office shall register the fuel consumers.</seg>
<seg id="634">He is obliged to indicate, in addition to the legal facts, the address of the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage facility must be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the quantity of propellants (marker, measuring rod) to be measured at reception and dispensing.</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank shall comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must purchase the fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As these are fuels in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when delivering fuel through a tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottle from a measuring device installed in the tanker when refuelling the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">That document shall contain, in addition to the quantities, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the DMV.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax administrator, is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel.</seg>
<seg id="643">When exercising tax supervision over mineral oils, the tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the course of his business and meets the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Provided that the statutory conditions are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced tax rate, i.e. € 2,652 per hl/per cent by volume of actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to a quantity of up to 200 000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As the production of beer outside the duty suspension scheme is concerned, there is no need for an accompanying document for the transport as it is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family businesses which also operate restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own beer for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative acts in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter presents the performance of tax supervision of excise tax administration in selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was due to the implementation of more EMCS traffic.</seg>
<seg id="654">On the contrary, the biggest year-on-year decline was recorded in 2014, namely by up to 4.3%, which was caused by fewer completed tax inspections and fewer tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="655">This decrease related to legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax controls</seg>
<seg id="657">By carrying out a tax audit, the CA ascertains or examines facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">When performing a tax audit, CA employees present themselves with a tax audit mandate, which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject of the audit and the scope of the audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period may be one month or more tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The scope of audited tax periods is determined by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="661">The tax inspection begins when the record of the commencement of the tax inspection is drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="662">Acceptance of the documents shall be confirmed by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="663">The CA is obliged to return the loaned documents within 30 days of the completion of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="664">The CA employee draws up a report from the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="665">If a tax audit reveals a difference in the sum that the audited tax subject should have paid, declared or claimed a refund, the CA shall also send the audited tax subject an invitation to comment on the findings set out in the minutes.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax inspection shall end on the date of delivery of the report.</seg>
<seg id="667">The period for carrying out a tax audit shall not exceed one year from the date of its commencement.</seg>
<seg id="668">The tax inspection of registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once until the date of termination of the right to determine the tax, which shall be 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FF SR issued an internal management act modifying the above-mentioned deadlines due to the unified procedure of the tax administrator on the territory of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigation</seg>
<seg id="671">Local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator in which it searches for evidence, examines and establishes facts that are needed for the purposes of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">An employee of the CA draws up a report on the local investigation and gives a copy to the tax subject.</seg>
<seg id="673">When carrying out a local investigation, a CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places, including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The quantity of alcohol produced shall be accounted for by means of an on-the-spot survey.</seg>
<seg id="675">The established facts are the basis for the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="676">Similarly, when carrying out an on-the-spot investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples and to secure the case.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FF SR issued an internal management act regulating the performance of tax supervision and local investigation for individual subjects of excise duties in order to unify the procedures of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses per alcohol</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1. 5. In 2004, there was also a change in the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the administration of excise duty on alcohol, the improvement of the business environment in this area and the introduction of legislative instruments for more effective suppression of the shadow economy in this area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in connection with the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures introduced by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the area of excise tax administration from tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administrator to be present in the tax warehouse for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation defines exhaustively that it is possible to receive, dispense, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse only in the presence of a CA employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This shall not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches ethyl alcohol only in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CA is obliged to provide employees in the tax warehouse so that the receipt, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol is not restricted.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator is obliged to ensure the working environment conditions for CA employees.</seg>
<seg id="686">On the basis of a contract concluded with the FC SR for the premises provided, the CA pays the tax warehouse operator the rental costs.</seg>
<seg id="687">In a tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of ethyl alcohol, the production facility for the storage of ethyl alcohol must be adapted in such a way that the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced, processed ethyl alcohol, stored ethyl alcohol, including stocks of ethyl alcohol and the alcohol contained therein, can be ascertained at any time.</seg>
<seg id="688">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">Where ethyl alcohol is not received, dispensed, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee and shall be required to secure that area by sealing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this option is not used very often as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators make use of the legal possibility within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 Coll., on the production and marketing of ethyl alcohol, and use the production facilities for the production of ethyl alcohol in the distillery for growing burning and also for the purposes of the distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Around 250 customs officers carry out permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses per alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issuing vouchers for the collection of alcohol stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration collection number and to issue a voucher for the collection of stamps for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="695">An alcoholic beverage which is ethyl alcohol means goods of the combined nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1,2 per cent vol.</seg>
<seg id="696">The trade mark is intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol shall be considered to be sealed immediate packaging filled with ethyl alcohol intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packages falling within Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be put into free circulation for tax purposes in the tax territory only if they bear a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee and the importer of consumer packaging, who will put it into free tax circulation, may mark the consumer packaging of alcohol with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="700">The stamp contains, inter alia, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical digit. The identification number contains the registration subscription number (1.ç6. instead of a numeric digit), the volume of alcohol (7.- 11. instead of a numerical digit) and the concentration by volume of alcohol in consumer packaging (12.- 14. instead of a numeric digit).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original design of the stamp on alcohol:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration collection number shall be assigned by the CA to each purchaser of the stamp separately.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a control mark the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the consumer package, the volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer package and the customer's control mark may be used to indicate the immediate packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the end of 2014, the national legislation introduced a new information system for postage stamps.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new stamp information system was to simplify and computerize the system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of consumer packaging and the consignee (buyer) of alcohol may label the consumer packaging of alcohol with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="707">A stamp purchaser wishing to collect stamps under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of postage stamps is obliged to request their issue, to report data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of postage stamps.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.</seg>
<seg id="710">The tax administrator also communicates with purchasers of postage stamps through the electronic system of postage stamps, especially when announcing the number of postage stamps that the purchaser of postage stamps may withdraw, or when determining the date of receipt of postage stamps by the purchaser of postage stamps in the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="711">Before receiving the stamps, the purchaser of the stamps is obliged to deposit into the tax administrator's account funds corresponding to the price of the stamps which he may withdraw and the amount of which shall be notified to him by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the stamp takes into account the amount of refunds to the printer. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">The state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice is authorised to print the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="714">FF SR performs tax supervision over the handling of stamps and their liquidation in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="715">The FS SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when handling the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="716">FF SR ensures the sale of postage stamps to the purchaser of postage stamps in the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="717">The stamps may only be collected in a printing works from an employee of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issuance of vouchers for the collection of postage stamps for tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="719">The purchaser of the stamp must apply to the CA for the allocation of a registration collection number and the issue of a voucher for the collection of the stamp.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packages of cigarettes may be put into free circulation for tax purposes only if they bear a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="721">Only an undertaking which manufactures cigarettes may affix a control mark to the consumer packet of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee or the importer of tobacco products who wishes to put tobacco products into free tax circulation in the tax territory may be a purchaser of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only a stamp the particulars of which correspond to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of cigarettes, the sign of validity of the rate of duty and the registration number may be used to indicate the consumer pack of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="724">Consumer packages of cigarettes may be sold for final consumption only at the price indicated on the stamp.</seg>
<seg id="725">At the end of 2014, the national legislation introduced a new information system for postage stamps.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new stamp information system was to simplify and computerise the system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for the marking of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">A stamp purchaser wishing to collect stamps under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of postage stamps is obliged to request their issue, to report data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of postage stamps.</seg>

<seg id="735">A control mark may be affixed to the consumer packaging of cigars or cigarillos by the tax warehouse operator, the importer of tobacco products or the authorised consignee.</seg>
<seg id="736">Only a control mark the particulars of which correspond to the indication of the validity of the rate of excise duty shall be used to indicate the immediate packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos.</seg>
<seg id="737">A control mark may be affixed to the consumer pack of cigarettes only in the undertaking which manufactured them.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of stamps ordered may not be less than 500 or more.</seg>
<seg id="739">Within three working days at the latest, the CA shall notify the purchaser of the stamps electronically of the number of stamps it may withdraw, the price of the stamps and the account number of the FC SR.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CA may reduce the number of stamps ordered if there are circumstances on the basis of which it is reasonable to assume that there may be a breach of tax legislation.</seg>
<seg id="741">The FS SR will determine the date of receipt of the stamps by the purchaser of the stamps, but no later than within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The date of receipt of the postage stamps will be notified to the purchaser of postage stamps via the electronic system of postage stamps.</seg>

<seg id="745">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)</seg>
<seg id="746">In accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and SPD Systems Department of the Excise Tax Department of the FF SR is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information on the basis of a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent financial administration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="747">These are in particular requests for examination of entities within the framework of excise administration, requests for information concerning excise administration and also requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications shall take place in electronic form within the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States includes the following actions: requests for administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on excise administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEED); reply to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the Slovak Republic, permanent tax supervision is applied to tax warehouses for alcohol; in the Czech Republic, this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by the tax administrator via a tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouses, in Slovakia they are only registered by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="755">In Slovakia, there is an institute of registered consignor, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In Slovakia, with a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in the case of growing burning, it is possible to burn 43 l a.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can be applied only to 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">Growing distilleries in Slovakia must have a permit not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, cultivation distilleries are allowed only by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="760">In Slovakia, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is carried out in addition to the tax warehouse operator also by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The importer's authorisation shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise authorities.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol does not require any special permission from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="763">In Slovakia, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is subject to the issuance of a tax administrator's authorisation for the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records, inter alia, of purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the Trade Licensing Office; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In Slovakia, the fuel vendor must have permission from the tax authority to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">National legislation in Slovakia does not regulate petrol stations by any special regulation, all activities relating to petrol stations are regulated only in the Act on excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the petrol station is regulated by a special fuel law, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Slovakia, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of service stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In Slovakia, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was due to a legislative change during that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative acts</seg>
<seg id="775">In the Slovak Republic, the substantive legislation stipulates the obligation to carry out tax inspections of selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified in an internal management act issued by the FF SR due to the application of a uniform procedure of tax administrators in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, the substantive legislation does not provide for the obligation to carry out tax inspections; the procedural legislation provides only for the possibility of carrying out inspections no later than the deadline for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections and local investigations carried out in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal governing act of the FSR determines in which cases and within what time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to the increase in the number of transports in the EMCS system and also due to the increase in the number of tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the Slovak Republic, the number of administrative operations followed a slightly increasing trend between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the increasing number of traffic in the EMCS system and at the same time by the decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of taxpayers have resulted in different legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is approximately two-thirds of the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same number of administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="785">From the above it can be stated that the SR is focused more on carrying out administrative tasks by tax administrators, e.g. performing physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, more emphasis is placed on remote monitoring, e.g. monitoring devices, immediate sending of data via a web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronicisation of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronicization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be filed via a data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, which, however, can no longer be processed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must then be transferred to the taxpayer's personal tax account.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is the limitation of the error rate of the submitted tax returns (DAP), which saves the tax administrator's actions related to the procedure for corrections erroneously filed by the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="793">The DGC is working on a new application for electronic processing of DAP.</seg>
<seg id="794">Smart forms can also be used to: submit tax or registration applications and notifications of changes in data, claim refunds, comply with reporting obligations for the handling of special mineral oils, the handling of crude tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax subjects in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registered subjects for registration by the tax administrator of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">The transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption scheme must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">The transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic may always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, a document proving exemption from excise duty, a decision of the customs office on the placing of selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision on the assessment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is determined by legislation.</seg>
<seg id="799">In order to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent to the data warehouse via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, where each such document is assigned a unique twelve-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">The JIK serves for customs control purposes en route and prevents repeated transport on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">At the largest operator of a fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts roughly half of the fuel volume into free tax circulation, CS CR has on-line access to the electronic registration system, into which the entity automatically stores the issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for registering and monitoring shipments of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should use 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for both declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to the Global Guarantee Scheme, the Tax Entity Register or the Risk Analysis System.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of documentary evidence without registration and the sharing of reference numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current procedure of registration of transports of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the abuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronics of administrative tasks in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="810">When administering excise taxes, the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the regime of conditional exemption from tax, stamps, filing tax returns and also in the registration and registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, one-way electronic communication between tax entities and the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">Within the framework of electronic communication, after entering the access data, the tax subject has access to a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal box, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the tax subject has access to an electronic mailroom through which he lodges applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through the personal internet zone does not concern all tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are primarily value added tax payers, tax advisors representing the tax entity and attorneys representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">During the audit, the SAO also examined the scope of computerization of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic transactions, namely tax returns and electronic communication within the ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">Leaving aside the transports carried out in the EMCS system, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">In the Slovak Republic, fully computerized processing of tax returns is already in place, from its filing to the registration of tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set up.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, tax entities can enter mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation on the website.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation is prepared in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting transports in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thereby eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in Slovakia in the area of computerization of tax returns, the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend completing the computerization of tax return processing in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organizational structure and personnel security in the field of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organisational arrangements of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">Customs Administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1st 2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organizational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">The DGC is the accounting unit for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive excise tax administration since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS CR also performs:</seg>
<seg id="838">(a) control of:</seg>
<seg id="839">in the field of road transport (weighing of goods vehicles, payment of road charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">• management of waste and packaging materials,</seg>
<seg id="841">the safety of imported food;</seg>
<seg id="842">in the field of consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">b) customs administration - it is a complex application of customs regulations, commercial policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">c) collection and enforcement of pecuniary benefits imposed by other public authorities within the framework of divided administration,</seg>
<seg id="846">d) activities of the police authority (authorized customs authorities) in proceedings on crimes committed in violation of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the scope of competences (simultaneity of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are cost savings of scale as the public administration does not have to spend expenditures on the position of the control group for each subject of the control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden of the inspected persons is reduced by re-inspection.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also performs from 1. 12. 2016 competence to verify the fulfilment of obligations in the registration of sales (§ 2 para. 112/2016 Coll., on the registration of sales) and from 1. 1st 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and the conditions for the operation of gambling, including the imposition of penalties (Section 116 of Act No.186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">Within the project Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed with effect from 1. 1st 2013 a three-tier structure to a two-tier structure, with the abolition of the middle management link (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">The DGC spent approximately 51 million CZK (i.e. about €2,031,000).</seg>
<seg id="852">CS CR from 1. 1st 2013 consists of DGC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competences are determined by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial offices are internal organisational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to establish and abolish territorial workplaces and determine their material competence by decree.</seg>
<seg id="856">Legislation does not provide for any competences for the territorial workplace; the territorial workplaces exercise the competences of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure by 31. 12. 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organizational structure from 1. 1st 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Administration of excise duties by 31. 12. 2012 was performed by DGs, eight DGs and 58 CA units (including branches), i.e. 67 departments and departments in total.</seg>
<seg id="860">To 1. 1st In 2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the DGC and 51 departments at the CA and their territorial departments, as well as eight departments of the Legal Department of the DGC and the CA departments providing mobile supervision, i.e. Approximately 60 seats.</seg>
<seg id="861">The costs of the CS CR most significantly affect wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in the service of the Act on the Service of Members of the Security Forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the number of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to the provisions of Section 42 para. 361/2003 Coll., on the Service of Members of the Security Forces, they may be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of service posts as a result of organizational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure the allocation of adequate service posts within the corps, or to provide service posts with another security corps (e.g. the Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will be reassigned to the reserve for temporarily unattached, in which members of the security corps are entitled to 80% of the average service income by law.</seg>
<seg id="866">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="867">Organizational arrangement of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="868">As part of the Programme Declaration for 2012-2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic has identified as one of its priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will provide additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, customs duties and levies and suppressing tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">FS SR was established on 1. 1st 333/2011 Coll., on State Administration Bodies in the Field of Taxes, Fees and Customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization that has its seat in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">FŘ SR, CA and Criminal Office of Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No. 199/2004 Coll., the Customs Act and on Amendments and Amendments to Certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities if they perform tasks under customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="872">In accordance with Act No.333/2011 Coll., on State Administration Bodies in the Field of Taxes, Fees and Customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities they form the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organizational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competence Centre of Financial Operations, tax authorities, the Tax Office for Selected Tax Entities, branches of tax authorities, contact points of tax authorities, customs offices, branches of customs offices (CA Tax Branch, CA Combined Branch, CA Customs Branch) and customs office stations.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of FS SR is the effective collection and administration of taxes and customs, i.e. also excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the FC SR is the President of the Financial Administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The President of the Financial Administration is responsible to him for the activities of the whole financial administration and therefore also for the activities of the FC SR, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organizational structure of FF SR from 1. 1st 2012 in abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">Within all customs offices in Slovakia, activities and processes in the field of excise administration are ensured by the excise department (9 departments) and the legal department (9 departments) in addition to branches of customs offices (38 branches) and stations of customs offices (18 stations).</seg>

<seg id="883">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organizational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, in 2015, apart from the FSSR, the administration of excise duties was dealt with by 74 organizational units with a total number of 1 300 employees; these units manage almost 48 000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties in 2015 was handled by approximately 60 organizational units with a total number of 1,011 employees, which manage approximately 114,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of excise tax administration is divided between several personnel independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their mutual coordination and cooperation is solved through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax inspection) in the field of excise tax administration is divided between the excise tax department and the branch of the customs office, within which the same employees of the tax administrator often deal with this agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In the Slovak Republic, there is approximately one-third of the number of tax subjects per total number of employees in the area of excise tax administration compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the effect of a higher number of employees on the efficiency of excise tax administration is not obvious.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of selected products was to make it possible to obtain information on the movement in real time and to carry out the prescribed checks, to facilitate the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When setting up the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of the EP and Council Decision allows the inclusion in the EMCS of a national specification, a national database forming part of the system and such hardware or software as a Member State considers necessary to ensure full use of the system in its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionalities of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by the Selected Products Registration System (EVV), which operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1. 4th 2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">In the Czech Republic, the so-called customs module and declarant module were introduced.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">In addition to the Community system, in the Czech Republic the EMCS system monitors transports under the conditional exemption scheme initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">After approval of the notification of receipt of a consignment intended for an authorised consignee for a single acceptance, the system ensures the automatic sending of the information to the tax entity register followed by the invalidation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures the administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including the sending of replies with an attachment in any format and the provision of translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a manual export termination report in the ECS (only the transmission of an automatically generated report is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">EMCS will not allow the approval of an e-AD or receipt notification without a response from the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available for tax subjects free of charge, it takes the form of a web application, to which the user logs in with a username and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with the CS ČR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each operation in relation to the EMCS customs module shall bear a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The declaratory module allows tax subjects to directly record data on commenced and completed movements under the duty suspension regime, so that tax subjects do not have to spend money on the acquisition of the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module make it possible to retrieve and store data offline (saving time for frequently used data), to fill in data on the recipient on the basis of a SEED ID check and to require mandatory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows you to block in real time the securing of excise tax in the corresponding amount of taxable supply for each consignment sent from the Czech Republic until the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient security, it is not possible to send the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA of dispatch from the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each guarantee has a unique number and contains the ARC of the transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of EMCS was implemented on the basis of eight contracts with performance from 2006 to 2017 in the total amount of CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. 1 761 412,56 €) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. 1 640 401,10 €) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="920">In the audited period, expenditures amounting to CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547.438.99).</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade during the audited period and converted to one transport input into the EMCS is on average CZK 16.49 (i.e. Excluding national transport, these expenses per transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States amount to CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92).</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four contracts from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support in the amount of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. €281,389.77) including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport loaded into the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">The development and technical support invoices related to the national solution and developed the EVV application already operated by the DG before the EMCS system itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">Invoices were paid under programme financing from national resources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services and other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="929">EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document - SAD, which was used before the entry into force of this system, thereby ensuring better control and management of transport.</seg>
<seg id="931">In Slovakia, it has been introduced since 1. 4th 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport.</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which it is possible to monitor the transport on-line, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionalities of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by those tax entities authorised to use the EMCS system, thereby significantly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest evolution of functionalities occurred in 2011 when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The implementation of the EMCS system was implemented as another module of the SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of the EMCS was to replace the paper-based transport administration system.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefit of the EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU from the announcement of the start of transport to its termination - a significant reduction in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities for the processing, transmission and archiving of documents.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, national functionality enabling traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two points in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been introduced into the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, the automatic functionality of on-line monitoring and guaranteeing of excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">There is also a national functionality that monitors the risk of the tax subject or transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="946">Slovakia and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of transports within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, the expenditure spent in Slovakia on upgrading this system was €744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO SR obtained data on the upgrade of the EMCS system from the FS SR only for the period since 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Nevertheless, the expenditure spent on the upgrade of the EMCS system in Slovakia was 188,134.44 € higher than the expenditure on the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system in the ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the audited period, the volume of expenditures related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic per transport exceeds 2.3 times the expenditures of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">Cooperation between the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic met the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax administration system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences between the two tax systems which affect the efficiency of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel audits, examples of good practice were identified that could contribute to reducing tax fraud, and their importance will increase as tax rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures to reduce the costs of administering excise duties have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons unless mutually coordinated due diligence checks are carried out at the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of SAIs is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of a parallel audit of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The 1977 Lima Declaration stresses that supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Organisation The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be one of the most important parts of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 6th EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenues carried out by SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">The development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue is an important step towards optimising the control activities of SAI.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies in particular to taxation, which is the largest source of public revenue and the most prone to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of the SAI of another state.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the revenues of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat this crime, the competent authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAIs that carry out inspections in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea of carrying out an audit of the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") and VIES was conceived in cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors).</seg>
<seg id="14">Careful preparation followed, when both parties first had to get acquainted with the legal environment and procedures for VAT administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was made and included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving efficient and efficient VAT administration is a long-term problem and individual countries (particularly the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrations, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the international information exchange system.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel inspections of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Inspection number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Administration of value added tax after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in administering value added tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "EU") connected with the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, especially when controlling the application of the right to exemption from value added tax for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax, with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the above-mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">This should result in a report on the weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">Value added tax information exchange system The audit operations were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the SAO") and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH") in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected business transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Czech Republic") and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as the "German Republic"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT administration systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with the European Directive No.31 for the implementation of INTOSAI auditing standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 31. 12. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">A parallel audit in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to the main point - the exchange of information on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - the audit covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the audit included the legal situation in the field of international passenger transport by bus and a comparison of certain statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">A comparison of the VAT administration systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion for registration is (among others) exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, taxpayers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, which is used only for business transactions on the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different registration methods create problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU (cf. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus passenger transport is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (cf. 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic payers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany payers are obliged to file so-called provisional VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must file an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike in the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file provisional tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic payers file summary reports at tax offices, in Germany payers file summary reports at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="53">Financial authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have data from summary reports immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">The information from the recapitulative statements is available to the German tax authorities only after it has been processed at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">The fight against VAT fraud requires that updated information on intra-Community transactions be made available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">The monthly reporting of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the transaction date and the update of the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would in turn allow timely verification of taxation in the Member State of the purchaser (cf. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">However, this would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="59">(5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for incoming requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not keep track of the elapsed time.</seg>
<seg id="62">Consequently, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the prescribed period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Due to these problems, the BRH recommended to the German CLO the implementation of a permanent warning (cf. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">(6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has its own strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5. ).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, both SAIs examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions in which there were doubts about their implementation or suspicions of VAT evasion were examined using the Customs Duty legislation.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used the information obtained in the form of international cooperation and assessed the VAT liability of the payers.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers either improperly exercised the right to exemption of the supply from VAT or did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases were found where payers erroneously reported business transactions in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the VIES data were incorrect and the tax administrations had to examine these cases (cf. 6th ).</seg>
<seg id="78">Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="79">Progress of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the State Budget Revenue Department II and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited bodies were: Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as "MF") and 10 Financial Authorities - Financial Authority in Humpolec, Financial Authority in Jihlava, Financial Authority in Kadaň, Financial Authority in Liberec, Financial Authority in Nymburk, Financial Authority in Otrokovice, Financial Authority for Prague 1, Financial Authority for Prague 4 Financial Authority in Sokolov and Financial Authority in Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The audit conclusion of the auditing operation was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Progress of the audit operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Audit Group for Indirect Taxes and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The audit was part of the control plan for 2006 and was therefore reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">Following the test phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to cases selected by the BRH and later chosen by the SAO, the BRH had to notify the inspection to a number of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following Länder:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FC for corporations/legal entities (München-Körperschaften), München II, IV and München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Central (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Schweig), Habsburg (Hamburg-Schwein-Bonn) and Leipzig (Hamburg-Schweinfeld), Haupt-Bonn (Haupt-Bonn)</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, negotiations were held with the Augsburg-City Tax Office (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old Town (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A report on the audit findings was submitted by the Ministry of Finance in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between both SAIs</seg>
<seg id="95">As part of the preparation of parallel audit actions, several meetings of representatives of both audit institutions took place in the period prior to their launch.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants of these meetings got acquainted with the organization of tax administrations, with the legislative regulation of VAT issues and with the VAT administration system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">The topics of the test phase were agreed at a meeting held in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">During this meeting, a timetable for the further progress of the work was agreed and the following topics of parallel controls were identified:</seg>
<seg id="100">1st VAT payer registration.</seg>
<seg id="101">2nd</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus passenger transport - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3rd International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators in handling requests for information and examining selected problem cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4th VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6th</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7th Risk management in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the joint audit day of the SAO and the BRH, which took place in December 2006, both parties got acquainted with the course of the audit in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="111">A report on the results of parallel inspections of VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4th Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 337/1992 Coll."), a taxpayer, a tax payer and a legal successor of a natural or legal person who is defined as a tax subject by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31. 12. In 2004, a total of 421 865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">To 1. 12. In 2005, the number of tax entities registered for VAT increased to 457,590.</seg>
<seg id="118">A taxable person who has a registered office, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) in the preceding 12 consecutive calendar months becomes a payer from the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 para. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter referred to as "Act No.</seg>
<seg id="119">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he/she exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legal regulation does not allow registration of a taxable person so-called retroactively in cases where the reason for registration is exceeding the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to deduct may become a tax payer even if it does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) if it fulfils any of the other conditions specified in Act No.235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down by law may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">The delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator initiates the registration procedure under Act No. 337/1992 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="124">The voluntary VAT payer shall also state on the VAT registration application the date on which he/she applies for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">Tax administrator data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed registration form with all attachments will be verified.</seg>
<seg id="126">If it has doubts about the information provided, it shall ask the tax subject to explain, supplement or substantiate the information.</seg>
<seg id="127">After verifying that the tax subject meets the conditions for registration, the tax administrator issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the tax subject is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as "TIN").</seg>
<seg id="128">The tax administrator shall indicate on the certificate the effective date of VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT tax period.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year did not reach CZK 10 000 000 (EUR 335 750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the preceding calendar year reached CZK 10 000 000 (EUR 335 750), the tax period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">A payer whose turnover in the preceding calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the VAT number in the registration certificate is always of a constitutive nature and the tax subject is obliged to indicate it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No.235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The TIN contains the code "CZ" and the master part, which is a generic identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number, or. another general identifier, if provided for by a special law, and in the case of a legal entity, an identification number (provision § 33 para. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax entity has not fulfilled its registration obligation even on the request of the tax administrator, the locally competent tax administrator shall register it without delay.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issuance of an Ex Officio Registration Certificate, which is served on the tax subject.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has been authorised to conduct business activities is assigned a TIN at the moment of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The tax subject uses the same VAT number even if he is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No.235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1 January 2004. 1st 2005, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, the tax administrator may charge the taxable person a refund of up to 10% of the total revenue or income for taxable transactions that the taxable person has carried out improperly without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been a registered payer by law to the date on which he became a registered payer by virtue of the tax administrator's decision (Section 98 para. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount determined in this way is considered as a tax payment (§ 98 para. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. is not a sanction.</seg>
<seg id="142">Cancellation of VAT registration if the statutory conditions are met is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">(1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, primarily due to the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (§ 106 para. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer is entitled to apply for deregistration no sooner than 1 year after the effective date stated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of registration ex officio (§ 106 para. 235/2004 Coll.), if: a) the payer has failed to perform for 12 consecutive months without announcing the reason to the tax administrator, b) the payer fails to fulfil his obligations under Act No.235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Payers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who carries out a transaction with a place of performance in the Czech Republic and is a person obliged to declare and pay tax on this transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No.235/2004 Coll. (the so-called "non-established payer") becomes a payer on the day of such transaction.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the Financial Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of performance.</seg>
<seg id="149">It is required to indicate in the registration application all the TINs allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If the "non-established" payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively, because according to Act No.235/2004 Coll., the tax subject became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">When registering retroactively, the Financial Office for Prague 1 requires tax entities to provide proof that the transaction has been performed (invoices or invoices). explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a "non-established" tax subject applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable supply is made, then the Financial Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the supply will take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">At the Financial Office for Prague 1, as of 31. 12. In 2004, 473 unsettled payers were registered, including 124 payers from Germany, and as of 31. 12. In 2005, 951 unsettled payers were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106 para. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the "non-established" payer as of 31 January of the following calendar year if the payer did not incur any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SAO audit revealed that if the "non-established" payer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. In accordance with the legal regulation by the deadline for filing the tax return, it is often not available to the tax office on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant for the possibility of deregistration to the tax authority are known later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel VAT registration in the Czech Republic in a given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as "AO"), anyone who carries out business activities is obliged to inform the municipal/municipal authority or the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the municipal/municipal office for the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax office identifies a business that has started but has not registered, the competent tax office may register that payer ex officio - even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both resident and non-resident for tax purposes in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria laid down in Paragraph 2 of the German Law on VAT ("the UStG").</seg>
<seg id="163">That obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover which they generate.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax offices for entrepreneurs permanently residing abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those established in the Czech Republic, the competent tax authority is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">The BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">As work permits for employees from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UStG because they are normally dependent on a single employer, which determines their working time and the manner in which they carry out their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant tax authority in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form which is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by departments with a general focus, which are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form is used to assess the risk of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last being always a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intra-Community supply.</seg>
<seg id="178">The CLO assigns a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="179">The CLO assigns VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when the payers indicate an intra-Community supply in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Entrepreneur's registration may be revoked: (1) at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activities), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all business years) and (2) if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of a VAT identification number is normally linked to the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the validity of the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not required to pay VAT if (1) the turnover plus the corresponding VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and (2) it is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small business owners (the "Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other business owners for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not liable for VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur may declare that the provisions of Section 19 para. 1 UStG to apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The trader can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For non-resident taxpayers, it is possible to appoint tax representatives (Paragraph 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is a prerequisite that they carry out exclusively exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of the tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">Invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion for registration is (among others) exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the stipulated limit, it has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure is standardised in Germany, but differences may arise as a result of different organisational models in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the tax identification number is assigned to the payer at the moment of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same VAT number for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the tax number assigned to the payer when registering for VAT is used only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH found out, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax authority about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, in particular the accurate estimation of VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different registration methods create problems, the conditions should be levelled across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Taxation Office will allocate the TIN at birth to a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This TIN will be valid for the entire life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will ask for an economic VAT number, which will be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the implementation of an IT device to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus passenger transport</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1. 5. 2004 Passenger transport between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax.</seg>
<seg id="216">That transport is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by traders who are registered for tax purposes in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return transport is considered to be a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out any other economic activity besides international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, ch. Article 5 (1) 1 (a) (b) where it is stated:</seg>
<seg id="220">For the purposes of Art. Article 28 (1) Article 3 (a) Pursuant to Article 5 (1) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt from value added tax the international transport of passengers referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Art. Article 28 (1) 4 of the Directive or for as long as the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier.</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of legal regulation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in § 3b para. 1 of the German VAT Act is the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) route (i.e. place) where the shipment takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore, the German tax system does not distinguish between domestic and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">Nor does the German tax system distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxable person transports passengers through Germany, the part of the route which takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable supply of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">A non-resident taxpayer must declare his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent tax authority before carrying out his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The IRS registers this non-resident taxable person (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is required to declare his taxable supplies of transport in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers who were engaged in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">Where the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person liable for VAT, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the VAT himself to the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity liable to pay VAT to the tax authority and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxable person is the tax resident receiving the services; this process is known as reverse charge and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the declaration by the non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have a number of means of assessing the accuracy of the declared taxable supplies of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="234">Customs office mobile inspection teams audit the certificates of buses with a foreign transport permit (licence) which are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, the mobile control teams send an inspection report to the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile inspection group is entitled to demand payment of VAT from the bus driver before continuing onward transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident taxable person may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may declare its intention to carry out an audit, which must take place in the office of the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If there is to be a review of the VAT return or the fulfilment of the obligations of a non-resident taxable person, the BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour-intensive in comparison with the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable supplies of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer entails disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration must audit foreign accounting, which means not only knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than a resident tax audit, but this audit is limited to those passenger transport services that take place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer is not only required to accept the right of inspection enjoyed by his national tax authorities, but also the right to have an audit carried out by other Member States in which he transports passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">Moreover, in any Member State in which only one supply of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is required to comply with all the tax obligations applicable to him in those Member States, in all the languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">Effective taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of passengers between individual EU Member States, i.e. between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport is provided for the first time in Germany by a non-established payer, he is obliged to give advance notice of the provision of transport to the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable supplies of part of the transport in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">The implementation of the law in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are active in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the efforts, the tax revenue, when realised, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive outcome.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate VAT costs, the supply of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the State where the transport starts or where the provider is based.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require an adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT tax returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to file a VAT tax return on a form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is due within the deadline for filing a VAT tax return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the importation of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No.235/2004 Coll., for which the due date of the tax is determined by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a refundable overpayment arises as a result of the assessment of the excess deduction, the payer shall be reimbursed without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings concerning the payer's tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of Section 73 para. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct may be exercised in the regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">After this period, the right to deduct may be exercised up to 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct could be exercised at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible by submitting an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1 January 2004. 1st 2005 allows the filing of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT tax return if (a) by means of a summary of corrections he/she increases the tax liability, (b) he/she makes a correction in which the last known tax obligation does not change, but only the data previously claimed by the tax subject, (c) he/she corrects the rate and amount of the tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No.235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the totality of the corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The submission of a VAT return in electronic form may be made either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">Internet submissions may be made as submissions with a data message bearing an advanced electronic signature or as submissions with a data message bearing no advanced electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of filing with a data message not bearing an advanced electronic signature, filing in written form is also required, i.e. delivery of a computer report to the tax administrator (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">Acquisition values of services are reported on separate VAT return lines.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated control within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of supplies of goods to other Member States to persons registered for tax purposes in other Member States shall be compared with the data contained in the recapitulative statements submitted by the Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from persons registered for tax purposes in other Member States shall be compared with the values obtained through VIES from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The tax office is carrying out a credibility test of VAT returns under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is carried out automatically, as VAT returns cannot be assessed without a test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test includes the calculation of credibility criteria and the evaluation of risky types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of Section 37 para. 337/1992 Coll., the Financial Office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply within a specified period with an obligation of a non-monetary nature arising from this or a special tax act, or imposed by a decision pursuant to this Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system used by the FCA for technical support of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The SAO audit revealed that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for failing to file a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between provisional monthly or quarterly VAT returns and annual VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit provisional VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not subject to VAT must submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">In general, taxpayers are required to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (§18 para. 2 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the preceding calendar year or in the case of a newly established business, the trader concerned is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if there has been a tax refund in the past year that exceeded EUR 6,136 (§18 para. 2a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns need not be submitted if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax year in which the VAT accrued.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FCA.</seg>
<seg id="297">Deadlines (under the law) for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to reimburse the tax in good time, provision may be made for the amount to be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process VAT returns and refund the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act provides for the possibility to extend this period (§ 18 para. 6 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension shall be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It makes it possible to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability one month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be settled against December's VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct an erroneous provisional VAT return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Correction of the annual VAT return in favour of or against the payer is possible within the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payers are required to submit provisional VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">Tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">Filing the annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is done without certification, payers must file the return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">If the payer fails to file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late filing, a penalty payment (maximum 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000) may be imposed on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="315">During a previous audit, the BRH found that tax authorities often do not impose this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard fine therefore fails to meet its objective of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">Acquisition values of services are reported on separate VAT return lines.</seg>
<seg id="320">Tax-free transactions must be reported on a separate line of tax return/VAT.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns which are submitted on paper, a copy must be made either by means of a scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from VAT returns submitted electronically are immediately available to the tax office employee.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data has been entered into the system, the RMS staff will go through it and make a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The selected VAT returns must be checked by a tax office official on the basis of an inspection report prepared by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax authorities must make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT to be paid by the taxpayer, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, tax payers file VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the amount of the payer's turnover, the tax year is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, payers file provisional VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or within a month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May of the following year, payers are required to file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly provisional) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">Where the payer corrects declared intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period covered by the recapitulative statement;</seg>
<seg id="335">The Länder do not normally compare VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers before processing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see. 4.1.3) German taxpayers are required to file an annual VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation enables the German tax authority to examine the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT returns with the direct tax returns and the closing accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from the submitted income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike in the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file VAT returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Act No.235/2004 Coll., a payer who has delivered goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall submit a summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH").</seg>
<seg id="345">The information on the value of the delivered goods is always given in Czech currency broken down by individual tax entities, stating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services rendered shall not be included in the TA.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH shall be filed by payers with monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of its termination with the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="348">The correction of erroneous data shall be carried out in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of detection of the errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">The erroneous data entered in the SH are always replaced by the data entered in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">As well as tax returns, payers can file SH in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer fails to file the SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed it under Act No.235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator will ask him to file it and at the same time instruct him on the consequences in the event of failure to file the SH or the subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax administrator is entitled under Section 37 of Act No.337/1992 Coll. to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for non-fulfilment of obligations of a non-monetary nature.</seg>
<seg id="352">The SAO audit revealed that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for failing to fulfil their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of SH submissions, taxpayers are not sufficiently incentivised to fulfil their obligations because the non-filing of SH does not affect VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged under § 102 para. 235/2004 Coll., to examine the data in the SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data for determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of discrepancy between the data in the SH and the data in the respective (payer with a monthly tax period) or relevant (payer with a quarterly tax period) VAT returns, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the declared tax obligation stated in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The erroneous data in the SH are removed by the tax subject by filing the subsequent SH himself or may be requested to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct the data on supplies of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">the payer fails to prove the data specified in the SH (or subsequent SH) and corrects them by filing a subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">The tax administrator has proved that the information provided by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH is not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">By inserting a correction without filing a subsequent SH by the payer, the tax administrator does not replace the submission of the tax subject, only adjusts the data in the VIES database so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The SH data shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">They can only be sent and received by a national financial administration body, designated for cooperation with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Ministry of Finance, the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automated message that the CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Contains all erroneous VAT IDs listed in sent SH lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If an incorrect VAT ID is used in one of the transferred normal lines of the SH or subsequent SH, an entry is made in the table of incorrect VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "Notification of doubts regarding VAT ID."</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and state the values of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT tax return and in the value of the delivered goods as stated by payers from other Member States in their SH are sent from the CLO to the tax office for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax authorities are obliged to investigate irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the respective VAT return lines is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator shall verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The amount of difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself submits an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether to verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT tax return despite this fact.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of acquisitions of goods from other Member States stated by the Czech tax payer in the respective VAT return lines is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here, too, it is at the discretion of the administrator to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After verifying the difference and clarifying the causes of its occurrence, the tax administrator enters the result of the verification into the ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the screening are transmitted back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">Figure 1 shows the number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005. source: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities decreased for each quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant drop in numbers occurred in 4. 2005 quarter. The CLO has increased the minimum threshold, inter alia with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between data from VAT returns and data from the EU may not always be caused by an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error due to the fact that some types of transactions may be introduced into the SH in different ways in different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of the reported transactions found at the audited tax authorities are set out in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community supplies from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in triangular transactions are obliged to file quarterly SHs listing intra-Community supplies by recipient (§ 18a para. 1 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The CA must be lodged by the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter concerned.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this period is granted in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be supplied by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers become aware that the SH contains incorrect information, they are obliged to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers do not file a SH, the CLO initiates proceedings to enforce the submission of that report.</seg>
<seg id="396">This procedure includes: - a first reminder - a second reminder with the threat of a fine/penalty payment - and - a periodic penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows fines of up to EUR 25 000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO imposes fines in three steps, amounting to EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Section 26a para. Article 1 (5) of the UStG provides that payers act unlawfully if, intentionally or negligently, they do not properly file the SH, submit it incompletely, fail to file it on time or fail to correct or correct it late.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence may be punished by a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the IRS as the processing of SH is the exclusive task of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data are stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">Therefore, data from the SH are visually available to the IRS only after their processing on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The processing times for SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Data from the SH must be stored within three months following the corresponding calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">If incorrect VAT IDs are entered in the SH of German payers, the CLO from another Member State will receive the O_MCTL codes.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks him for correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, threat and assessment of three additional fines takes up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The IRS refused to exempt declared intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file a corrected SH with the CLO, as the tax authorities cannot correct the VIES data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the corrected SH, so the payers often did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">In view of the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the supply data declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before the submission of these data to the CLOs of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of the VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States shall be processed on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then submitted to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">These data are used for acquisition control purposes by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they have been entered into the system, the CLO checks them against data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the assessment procedure shall subsequently cross-check this data with data on intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have delivered goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State submit the SS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities process the SH and transmit the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of supplies of goods to another Member State, stated by the payer in the TA, are compared at the tax offices with the values of supplies of goods to another Member State, stated by these payers in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who have made intra-community supplies are obliged to file the SP on a quarterly basis by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers file on CLO, from 1. 1st 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The information from the SH is available to the tax authorities only after its processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Payers from the Czech Republic and Germany state in the SH only the delivery of goods, the provision of services is not mentioned in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the erroneous lines filed by the SH on their own.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to the data of the German VIES system, the erroneous VAT ID was not corrected even though the payer provided the SA with the correct VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the data on intra-Community supplies which appear in the VAT return of the German payer and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of these two reports are usually not detected before the German CLO provides VIES data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Given the findings of the BRH, it is clear that a comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">In the Czech Republic, data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison shall be made by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are handed over to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the tax returns of payers.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such general control is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax authorities control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other payers only if the RMS produces an inspection warning or if the payer is designated for inspection anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities of the need to explain the reasons for any difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">The fight against carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides the tax authorities with information that may be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if the payers file SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs because most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file monthly VAT returns and the SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, the filing of a SH may be combined with the filing of a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to administer SH on a monthly basis would cause more time discrepancies between reporting intra-community delivery and intra-community acquisition and could increase the data flow between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the German federal government considered a general provision for monthly SHs.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed due to doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They were concerned that the monthly submission of VIES data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the obligation of monthly SH reporting and monthly data transmission were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In terms of foreign trade, Germany is the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods carried out between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for individual quarters of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These figures are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The figures show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">These differences may be due to different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">Level 3 International Information Exchange</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information enables tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-Community commercial transactions and the payers who have carried out such transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information on request is carried out in the form of so-called requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "REI") using standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI or replies to the delivered ŽOI through the financial directorates at the CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided on the standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also ensures the reception of LIs from other Member States and replies to sent LIs, their translation into Czech and distribution to locally competent tax administrators for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">In Art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 provides for a maximum period of three months from receipt of the application for the processing of the RES.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO audited all RUs handed over between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the total number of 94 ZOIs received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) dealt with within the three-month deadline, a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and the remaining 1 case had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information on the deadlines within which the responses received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the total number of 335 CIs sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) response received within the three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) the response from Germany had not been received by the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the submitted data when the response from Germany had been received).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the deadlines within which the responses to the RTD sent to Germany were delivered to the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage expression of the values of intra-community transactions reported in the ZOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany can be found in Graph 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the graph above, the value of commercial transactions examined through the RUs was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax authorities from other Member States are often provided, without prior request, with information that may be relevant to them when administering VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected on the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The information shall be transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, "automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax administrator from the Report on the Delivery of a New Means of Transport form pursuant to Section 19 of Act No.235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing the above-mentioned form, the tax administrator fills in the necessary data in a specially created template and returns them to the contact person at the Financial Directorate, where these data are collected and within the specified deadline, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which this information was available, it shall be transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on VAT-exempt mail order sales in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions that appear to be unjustified and information on potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of international information exchange in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">Financial authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly by email to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to foreign CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">Unless there is a reasonable reason for such a request, the German CLO shall reject any application containing an amount lower than that limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E) ] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To respond to a request for information, the CLO sends a request to the relevant tax authority, indicating a three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no further deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to the response to unanswered requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit, covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can cover only one transaction that has been carried out recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible type of audit requires no notification to the taxpayer and has proven its usefulness in investigating individual taxable business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the framework of automatic exchange without prior request, the FED provides other Member States with information on VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States, on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, b. sending or catalogue sale in other Member States which is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intra-Community supply of goods which the German payer did not declare in the SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "missing trader" who carried out intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT IDs, f. entrepreneurs who supplied their VAT IDs to potential recipients, f.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Sending of the ZOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and Germany by the locally competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech - English) and translates the sent information into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the instruction that they should write the ZOI or spontaneous information only in German on the monolingual form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">Examination of the RUs transmitted in the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 31. 12. 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration dealt with 74.5% of the applications received within the three-month deadline, while the applications sent to Germany were dealt with by the German tax administration within the deadline in only 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO draws the attention of the tax authorities to the three-month period, it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">Missing alerts result in a large number of delayed responses to the RES.</seg>
<seg id="515">Due to these problems, the BRH recommended regular warnings to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, the German CLO is now alerting the tax authorities to the answers to the unfinished responses to the FOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">Risk management in the field of VAT</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, VAT risk management is handled by several departments at various organizational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Ministry of Finance, the following departments deal with the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of Methodology and VAT Performance, including a report on VAT Risk Management, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at the domestic and Community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">It coordinates nationwide the functioning of the role of the Trustworthiness of VAT returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">On the basis of data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, conceptually processes VAT risk management and cooperates in this area with relevant EU institutions and other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT, which, among other things, ensures the exchange of information in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public information and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for individual quarters of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These figures are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The figures show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">These differences may be due to different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was filed, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department of Tax Control and Search Methodologies, which, among other things, performs risk analysis within the framework of methodological management of tax inspections and, in accordance with the risk analysis, sets priorities for targeting tax inspections in the plans of financial directorates, prepares risk analyses within the framework of reducing tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge gained during tax administration and from other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Search departments are set up in the financial directorates to carry out, among other things, searches for tax entities and areas that are at risk of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches for unregistered tax entities for risks of tax evasion (e.g. in the field of internet services, employment mediation, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of chain fraud links and transmission of information to territorial tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialised control units are set up in selected 12 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have a regional remit and carry out tax inspections outside the territorial remit of the tax authorities on the basis of a mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up specialised tax inspection units has arisen from the increasing discovery of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur mainly in chain-linked entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on the control of tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax entities of a large scope of activity in terms of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms for limiting VAT risks have been integrated into the ADIS system: the role of the credibility of VAT returns, used to evaluate the riskiness of submitted tax returns, the role of the selection of tax subjects for inspection, allowing the selection of payers for inspection on the basis of selected criteria, the role of the VIES, through which tax administrators have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES enables, among other things: to verify the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States, to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer, declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, to generate a report of payers who have not filed a SH, to carry out a formal check of the data that the payers from the Czech Republic have entered in the SH before sending these data to other Member States, to generate a report of payers for whom the data on supplies of goods to other Member States entered in the VAT returns do not coincide with the data of other Member States from the payers in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their activities to limit the risks of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to registers of state administration bodies, such as the Commercial Register, the Land Register, the Register of Motor Vehicles, the Register of Trades, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in the chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal (federal) structure of the FRG, the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the Customs Duty, the ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS") collects the findings of a check on tax fraud in a special database called the AACC.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed to transfer the names of tax evaders" companies to "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related domestic and cross-border tax fraud cases.</seg>
<seg id="547">KUSS experience is reflected in RMS development in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, the specialists of several other CLO and MF services are entrusted with the duties and powers associated with the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="549">At the level of the CLO, there is a formal control of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in the SH filed by German payers.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out prior to the provision of SH data to other Member States in order to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Validation of the VAT IDs listed in the SH is carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT IDs, cf. also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS on the CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and generates several types of control reports based on several characteristics usually found in so-called carousel trades in order to identify potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="553">The tax authorities of the Länder are instructed to prepare these inspection reports and, in some cases, to report on the results of their findings to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a case of tax fraud (rather than an exclusive focus on the company's turnover) is to be assumed with a sufficient degree of probability.</seg>
<seg id="555">The BRH therefore proposed to the MF that different characteristics be taken into account in the preparation of the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should also cover other factors, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour (morality), field (economic activities) or shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of the RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the Länder and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the RMS generates a list of those payers who have declared intra-Community supplies in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full SH submission.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions, as reported in the payer's annual VAT return, with VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder try to avoid comparing quarterly data because such a comparison would reveal too many discrepancies which are attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">the different execution time of the intra-Community transaction in the opinion of the supplier, on the one hand, and the recipient, on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">Different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (incentives) and their different presentation in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and VIES, many Länder have introduced elements of the RMS which are based on VAT return data and certain other facts (such as the structure of the company name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the payment behaviour/morality of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has implemented a rules-based RMS which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter risk managers) to programme their own rules for singling out potential tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied at the moment when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">The competent tax authority therefore receives the recommendation made by the RMS before determining VAT.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this RMS is unable to reflect up-to-date findings in its activities, risk managers need to adapt the relevant rules on the basis of feedback from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The administrative district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which a check revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">On the basis of this data, the RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The RMS draws up a monthly list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for decisions on the audit of proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">Following an audit, auditors must report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The district of North Rhine-Westphalia uses an adaptive artificial neural network which is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">On the basis of a large number of data assessed VAT returns and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or data-mining system calculates the probability that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of potential fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for inspection and report the findings of the inspection to the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of one of these three RMS is still ongoing in the other Länder.</seg>
<seg id="579">Given that none of the three RMS is based on an identical approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches in the three Länder of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of the EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - is not proving to be a national problem, but rather a European one.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several States.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">The VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not affect the Member State of origin of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be a European exchange and debate on the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">Within the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel auditing actions, the SAO and the BRH scrutinized the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">Furthermore, both audit institutions jointly scrutinized the implementation of several business transactions where there were doubts about their implementation, i.e. discrepancies in the way payers from both countries reported these business transactions in their VAT or SS tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the SAO scrutinized a total of 8 cases concerning business transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the SAO scrutinized, on the basis of a warning from the BRH, the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the SAO, BRH scrutinized a total of 23 cases concerning commercial transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of selected cases revealed, inter alia, that the different registration methods in the EU Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1st</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the data in VIES, the Czech payer should have purchased in III. quarter 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.</seg>
<seg id="602">Since the Czech payer only declared the acquisition of goods with a value equivalent to EUR 29 869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the goods supplied.</seg>
<seg id="603">In reply to the RES received from Germany, the German side stated that in II. quarter 2004, the German payer delivered goods worth EUR 27,381 to the Czech payer, in III. EUR 31 997 in the quarter and EUR 10 276 in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply also showed that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28. 9th 2004, but the German CLO in 2006, following an additional application from a German payer for a certificate of validity of VAT ID, retroactively issued a certificate of validity of VAT ID from 1. 5. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer repaired the SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, the Czech payer acquired the goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">In an inquiry to the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States and at the same time claimed a VAT deduction when acquiring goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax authorities could not clearly determine whether the values of supplies from the abovementioned German supplier were also included.</seg>
<seg id="609">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, because he did not ask for a VAT ID when registering, he was only given an identification number for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible to assign a VAT ID retroactively to the payer in Germany, in this case the German tax officer assigned a VAT ID retroactively to the above-mentioned German payer on 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively if the German trader has not caused a delay in allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by the CLO after the payer's application for VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies according to § 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other hand, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of his supplier in order to declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these different procedures between Member States, the German Customs Duty assigned VAT ID retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2nd</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested an examination of the German VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES indicated a registration date of 5. 3rd 2005, with the date 1 on the certificate of registration of the German payer issued by the locally competent German tax authority. 10 a.m. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a reply received from Germany, the German authorities stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1. 10 a.m. 2004, but the VAT ID was provided to him in Germany for organizational reasons up to 16. 2nd 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">When asked by the local tax administrator, the SAO found out that the Czech tax administrator had performed a VAT audit on the Czech payer for the tax period III. 2004 to II quarters. 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="621">By this audit, the tax office found that the Czech payer included services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) provided to the German payer before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1. 10 a.m. 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax year III. In the quarter of 2004, the tax office assessed the tax subject with VAT in the amount of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH found that the German payer was assigned a VAT ID of up to 16. 2nd 2005 when he informed the IRS about his business, which he started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer declared an intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approximately CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3rd The Czech payer reported VAT for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When verifying the registration of a German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found out that his registration was valid from 11. 11th 2004, i.e. only after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer filed an additional VAT DAP, in which he declared the taxable amount of CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) in respect of domestic transactions and CZK 21 777 (EUR 692) in respect of VAT which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO enquired with the locally competent tax office in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer subsequently filed an application for a retrial of the additional VAT tax return and submitted as evidence a certificate from the German tax administration stating that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2008. 1st The 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The response received from Germany showed that the German payer was assigned a VAT ID of up to 11. 11th 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for a retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that in the given case there was no intra-Community acquisition of goods, because the German payer did not obtain a VAT ID until 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German beneficiary declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on that acquisition by claiming a refund of input tax of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, because there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">The BRH also found that the name of the German payer in the ZOI was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, as a result of which two German tax entities were confused.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4th</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities verified the acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in I. quarter 2005 with a value of EUR 22 686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">When asked by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that the administrator had carried out a local investigation of the Czech payer, during which it verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had accounted for and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT tax return because the German supplier did not provide his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number designated for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was not registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions until 21. 4th 2005, i.e. only after the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German payer's registration certificate so that it could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Financial Office assessed the transaction as an acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany and therefore did not tax the Czech payer on the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that, under the German legislation, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID in order for an intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only has to have the VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act, it was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any event, it is important that the Czech tax authorities took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of the stated value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to LAIs concerning intra-Community transactions with a value of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to VIES data, the Czech payer had in III. quarter 2004 to acquire goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax inspection of the tax subject for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of international administrative cooperation, he requested the German tax authorities to verify the supply of those goods by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer disputed the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of those goods had not been entered in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the request to provide evidence of contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory justifications were provided.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence for the assessment of the tax on the acquired goods, it terminated the tax inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained at its original level.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (Section 22 a - e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer declared those supplies in his annual VAT return and in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was granted the right to exemption from delivery.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of a warning from the BRH, the German Financial Office will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for assessing the tax on acquired goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in Chapter 4.6.1, responses to RTDs sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more frequently than responses from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO found out that the Czech tax administration sent 5. 10 a.m. 2005 to Germany a request for information concerning the verification of the value of the delivered goods for 4. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer declared in the SH for this period the supply of goods to the Czech payer in the value of EUR 86 307 but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only in the value corresponding to EUR 35 314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In response to the ZOI, delivered to the Czech Republic 9. 5. 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the processing period laid down in Art. 8 By Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German authorities stated that the application could not be processed because the German firm's operations had ceased at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the ZOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7th In 2005, the Czech tax authority requested, by means of a SCAC form, an examination of the supplies of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German taxpayer made in III. and the fourth quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that no response had been received from Germany until the time of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also enquired with the local tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT return supplies of new means of transport for the German payer in the value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax subject filed the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH found that the German CLO did not hand over the above-mentioned ŽOI to the locally competent tax authority for examination for technical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following a warning from the BRH, a check was carried out in Germany on the German purchaser, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the cars in question had been sold to a reseller in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8th According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to purchase a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">The acquisition of these goods was not declared by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">In an inquiry to the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after appeals from the tax administrator, so the tax office sent him the tax returns on 23 March. 5. 2005 assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2. 6th 2005 The CLO drew attention to the above-mentioned delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the VAT to Germany concerning the above-mentioned supply.</seg>
<seg id="677">Because the response to the ZOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7. 2nd 2007, until the completion of the SAO audit, it was not known how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained through international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The Financial Office canceled the Czech payer's obligations arising from the VAT Act as of 23 June 2013. 8th 2005 VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the FOI because the audit carried out by the tax authorities on the payers had not been completed at the time of the SAO and BRH audit:</seg>
<seg id="680">9th</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax authorities requested, by means of a SCAC form, an examination of the supply of a car worth EUR 16 991 to the German taxpayer, carried out in III. 2004 quarter, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In reply to the ŽOI, the German tax authority stated that it had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for a supply of EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH found that the audit carried out by the German tax authority on the German acquirer had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in the tax returns for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10 a.m. In 2005, the Czech tax authorities requested, by means of a SCAC form, an examination of the supplies of cars to the German taxpayer worth EUR 198 167 made in the fourth quarter of 2004 and I. 2005 quarters, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial response to the ZOI to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by the German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that in order to verify the use of excessive VAT deductions, the local tax office carried out several local investigations at the Czech supplier, during which it did not detect their unjustified use.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German payer had declared in his VAT returns in that period the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579 114 and that the inspection carried out by the German tax authority on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the values of the intra-Community acquisition of goods declared by the recipient in the tax return and the values declared by the supplier in his SS.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that the most frequent reasons for the differences were not the time difference or the incorrect value of intra-Community delivery of goods in the SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11th</seg>
<seg id="693">The Czech payer had in I. According to data from the VIES system, the purchase of goods worth EUR 35 716 from the German payer in the quarter of 2005, but the Czech payer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify, as part of the international exchange of information, how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The response to the ZOI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax subject was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer delivered only goods worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of payment of EUR 155,153 to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">Following the discovery of fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech purchaser, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the material delivered, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO enquired with the locally competent tax office in the Czech Republic that the tax administrator, among other things, on the basis of the information obtained, subjected the Czech taxpayer to VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of the SAO's request, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier reported delivery of goods to the Czech payer only in the value of EUR 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer declared the adjusted values of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter in which the adjustment took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus, its SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of an international exchange of information, the German tax authorities requested, by means of a SCAC form, verification of the supplies of goods and services made in III. 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ZOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods with a total value of EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services with a value of EUR 11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation of the Czech payer in order to verify this supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the ZOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech payer delivered individual parts of the production line before the Czech Republic joined the EU and after 1. 5. In 2004, the line was assembled on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In III. In the quarter 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer accepted the invoices issued but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO also asked the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that all invoices are properly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the VAT returns for III. Only amounts which have been documented by the Czech payer and which relate to invoicing after 1. 5. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that, on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction in question involved the supply of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer, including services for assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of so-called work performance is where the production line was assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">Under the German VAT law, the German recipient of the supplied service is liable for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may claim a VAT deduction on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT payable by the German payer, corrections to the VAT return were neglected by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to VIES data, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth EUR 58 000 from German payer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax authority sent a request to Germany to examine this supply.</seg>
<seg id="721">In reply to the ZOI, the German side stated that this machine had already been delivered by the German payer C to the Czech payer B in 2004, who was to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but was transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, the response to the request for information showed that the German payer C sold the machine to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational unit of German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO enquired with the tax administrator responsible locally for payer B that, according to VIES data, German payer C delivered in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth 88 027 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="727">Payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the BOI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">Further inquiries with payer B revealed that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in payer B's accounts and that it could be of the same type as the machine delivered by the organizational unit of German payer C to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO also found out that the Czech tax administrator competent locally for payer A carried out a local investigation of this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator was in possession of an invoice from German payer C dated 7. 2nd 2005, which listed payer A as the customer of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The handover of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9. 2nd 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by a leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the response to the request for information was not used by the Czech Financial Office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that the German payer C did not deliver the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For those reasons, the German tax authorities did not grant German taxpayer C the VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D delivered the machine to Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">Under the German legislation, that supply was not taxable in Germany but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, the BRH found that the German payer C stated in his SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">That supply was not examined during the tax audit carried out by the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between the parties to the above business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14th</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO found out during the audit that the Czech tax administration had accepted on 4. 10 a.m. 2005 from Germany, a request for information in which the German tax administrator requested verification of an intra-Community supply from a German payer worth EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax authorities, it was suspected that this was a mock intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The ZOI also stated that the German payer had not engaged in any active commercial activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found out that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the statement of the manager of the Czech company, in the above-mentioned case it was probably a claim of the German payer against the German tax administration, which was claimed by the Czech payer as a shareholder of the German company before the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator does not currently have any information that the German tax administration has addressed the issue related to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not a delivery of goods, yet the stated value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-Community delivery of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following discrepancies was that the beneficiaries did not declare intra-Community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to VIES data, the German payer delivered in III. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the Czech payer of goods with a total value of EUR 33 205. The Czech payer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax authority requested verification of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to that request, the German tax authorities stated that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, while the remaining goods had been collected personally by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="757">In an inquiry to the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that even before receiving the response to the VAT, the Czech payer had filed additional VAT returns for these periods.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this filing, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended a tax inspection of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">No inspection has yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16th According to the data in VIES, the German payer delivered in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854.</seg>
<seg id="761">During the same period, the Czech payer declared intra-Community acquisitions only in the amount corresponding to EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax authority requested verification of the value of the supplies made.</seg>
<seg id="763">3 invoices with a total stated value of delivery of goods of EUR 31 999, i.e. the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="764">When asked by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that after receiving a reply from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech payer's accountant and agreed to discuss with the company owner the filing of an additional VAT return for III. 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="765">Additional VAT returns have not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that it will continue to proceed in order to meet the deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17th</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 11,600 to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator asked for confirmation whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged partner of the German payer had established more fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">During the examination of the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to the Czech payer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were further sold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted documents for the sale of goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany and did not declare or pay the tax when selling the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All of these facts indicated tax evasion in Germany and were communicated by the Czech tax authorities to the German tax authorities in response to the FOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">When asked by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had filed an additional VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, which included the value of the acquisition of goods from the German payer and at the same time claimed a tax deduction for the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT on the sale of goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">After a local investigation, the Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="778">Under the Czech legislation, that case did not concern the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods had not been dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax authority therefore drew an incorrect conclusion from the on-the-spot investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that the German tax authorities immediately corrected the German tax payer's tax return and demanded from him VAT in the amount of EUR 1 600 after receiving a reply to the ZOI stating that the goods had not left Germany.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent tax office sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods was correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, payers reported intra-community transactions that probably did not actually take place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The application was accompanied by a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="786">A copy of the passport of the person who was to carry out the transport of that car was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">An investigation by the Czech tax authority found that it was a stolen passport, the person named in it did not import any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was included by the Czech tax authority in the response to the ZOI together with the statement that it could not confirm the acquisition of the goods - the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">When asked by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that the Czech payer was not registered at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company's manager was uncontactable.</seg>
<seg id="791">After carrying out the charging procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer with a tax liability of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="792">Further investigation by the Czech tax authorities revealed that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which had purchased it through an advertisement on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">The BRH found that the locally competent German tax authority, on the basis of the Czech response to the ZOI, would not grant the German payer the right to VAT exemption for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of 3000 euro between the value of the goods acquired declared in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was stated that the Czech payer was to deliver during the fourth quarter of 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the German payer of goods worth EUR 89 424.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax authorities requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In reply to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company was removed from the Commercial Register on 8. 7th 2005 and the new manager was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">It appears that the German consignee of the goods was related to a partner in the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed VAT and SH tax returns, which were signed by an unauthorized person - the company partner - after the executive was deleted from the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The Czech payer's accountant confirmed to the tax administrator that the company's partner had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash documents were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">When asked by the local tax authority, the SAO in the Czech Republic found that the tax authority had recognised the Czech taxpayer's entitlement to VAT exemption on supplies of goods to another Member State in the amount of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the fourth quarter of 2004 and for I. quarter 2005 in the amount of CZK 1 416 180 (EUR 47 548).</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the tax authority in Germany did not correct the German purchaser's VAT return because a German judge had confirmed the German payer's insolvency in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since an earlier inspection revealed no evidence of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax charged.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to VIES data, the German payer acquired goods worth EUR 4 251 196 from the Czech Republic in 2005 after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In neither the 2004 tax return nor the 2005 tax return did the German payer declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="807">Moreover, it did not declare adequate supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these differences, the German tax office sent the RES concerning 4. quarter 2005 and 1. 2006 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported intra-Community delivery of goods to the German payer for these two quarters with a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6. 9th 2006 was delivered to the ŽOI, in which the German side asked to examine whether the intra-community supplies declared by the Czech payer had been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="811">In response to this request, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no managing director.</seg>
<seg id="812">According to the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax administrator, on 30. 3rd In 2006, a protocol was drawn up with the manager of the Czech payer on the start of the VAT inspection for the fourth quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the payer was asked by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above-mentioned periods, but he did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the sole director of the Czech payer ceased to hold office as of 16. 5. 2006, no new manager has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">As of April 2006, the Czech payer stopped submitting VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the audit, the SAO, in cooperation with the BRH, scrutinized several cases of intra-Community supplies made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which had not been the subject of prior exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases examined was exchanged between the two SAIs through the CLOs of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21st A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany has informed the competent tax authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company had been registered since June 2005, but had not received a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of a number of wind farms and the delivery of those wind farms in the name, at the risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to a lack of own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the mode of transport of wind farms:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of those transactions must be determined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="824">The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind farms for assembly under his own name, at his own risk and on his own account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the assembly of that supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">Since the carrier was instructed by the Danish contractor (eDK) and the transport was carried out under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the consignee is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of a German subcontractor (eD) could not be exempted because another Member State of destination is different from another Member State of residence of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">That supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery to the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">The delivery of wind farms that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">The supply of other wind farms that are produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intra-community delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not declare any intra-Community acquisitions or submit SH to the German CLO in its VAT return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech society reported all intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (eCR) showed no intra-community delivery to Austria, but intra-community delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">An examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the SAO and BRH examined the transactions in order to point out the differences between the reporting in the tax return and the VIES data, which were caused by the different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in the legal regulation need time for the application of new legislation into practice by payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In SH for II. until the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer declared intra-Community delivery to the German payer in the total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech payer declared intra-Community delivery to another German payer in the SH with a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to the information provided by the SAO from the BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers listed the above-mentioned deliveries in the SH in accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">Further examination of the above transactions revealed that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal regulation of the supply or purchase of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic, payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid wording of Act No.235/2004 Coll. as an intra-Community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legal regulation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition, but a taxable supply with a place of performance on the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in legal regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., which amends certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2004. 1st 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23rd When examining selected intra-community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer reported in the SH for 1 to 4. quarter 2005 intra-community delivery to the German payer in the total value of 240,411,163 CZK (8,071,823) and another Czech payer declared intra-community delivery to the German payer in the same period in the total value of 263,470,776 CZK (8,846,050 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by the SAO from the BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No.235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2004. 1st 2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of performance is the place where the customer has his registered office, place of business or where he has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech payers should not have mentioned the supply of electricity to the SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">By the fact that both of the above-mentioned payers reported intra-community supply of electricity in the SH, the data in VIES were distorted by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation met the objectives of the BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs gained a deeper knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the VAT administration legislation differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">Suspected cases of intra-community transactions have been identified during parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to check out afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs made recommendations concerning VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the Outcome of International Cooperation in Excise Duty Administration Inspections between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted joint report informs on the course and outcome of international cooperation in parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on the administration of excise duties in the period after the accession of both countries to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was implemented on the basis of a control cooperation contract concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel controls was chosen with regard to a fundamental change in the system of collecting excise duties, which occurred in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow goods free of tax to circulate until the date of their delivery for final consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under fiscal supervision under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on tax administrations and foresees close interaction between the competent administrations of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise duty administration checks for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Inspection number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of the audit: (Czech Republic) Excise Tax Administration (CR) Procedure of customs authorities in the administration of excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="14">On 8 February 2006, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO-CR) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO SR) concluded a "Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activities."</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel audits "Administration of Excise Taxes," included in the 2005 Audit Plan of the SAO-Czech Republic under No. 05/34, and "Control of the procedure of customs authorities in the administration of excise taxes," included in the 2006 Audit Plan of the SAO of the Slovak Republic under No. 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel controls were coordinated controls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information that the contracting parties could not obtain during the inspection of the administration of excise duties on their national territory and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the inspections within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards - Directive No 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the audit was carried out by groups of auditors from the State Budget Department and from the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Western Bohemia, Northwestern Bohemia, Northeastern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia in the period from 7 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">The audit involved 27 inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="20">The audited bodies were the General Directorate of Customs (hereinafter referred to as "DGC") and 11 tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Within the DG, 12 selected customs offices were audited out of a total of 54.</seg>
<seg id="22">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 in the period from 13 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit involved 8 auditors.</seg>

<seg id="43">2.1 Movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty between Member States of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="44">The conditions governing the movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty are laid down in Title III of Directive 92/12/EEC. 15 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="45">Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be carried out only by an authorised warehousekeeper, who means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, hold, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="46">A consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper but who may not store or redispatch such products under suspension arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="47">An authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovakia means a tax warehouse operator, an economic entity is an authorised consignee for repeated or one-off receipt of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="48">Under Directive 92/12/EEC, the movement of products subject to excise duty under suspension of excise duty is possible only with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the start of the transport, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch require a further copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure for commencing and terminating the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="51">Transport from the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="52">The procedure for commencing transport is governed by the provisions of Section 25 para. 353/2003 Coll., which states, among other things:</seg>

<seg id="67">Transport from Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="68">Until 31 December 2005, the procedure for transporting ethyl alcohol and tobacco products from Slovakia to another Member State of the European Union was regulated as follows:</seg>
<seg id="69">According to the provisions of § 26 para. 105/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="70">"When transporting a lie from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse or to an authorised recipient, or to a tax agent in the same member, you will send it to the consignor (supplier) obliged to send a copy of the first dielu of the original document electronically or by fax to the Cold Office of Poprad on the day of the start of the transport; this copy is required to be sent to the customs office in writing within the fifth working day of the beginning of the transport.</seg>

<seg id="73">When transporting other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the "supervised period"), the tax subject was not obliged to notify the Poprad Customs Office or the competent customs office of the commencement of transport under the conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax administrator learned about the transport of these products only during the local investigation or during the tax inspection from the accompanying documents and from the accounting documents of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="75">The consignor in Slovakia is obliged to draw up an accompanying document in four copies before starting the transport.</seg>
<seg id="76">Copy No 1 shall be retained by the consignor (for the transport of alcohol and tobacco products, a copy of Copy No 1 shall be sent electronically or by fax to the Poprad Customs Office and the competent customs office).</seg>
<seg id="77">Copies Nos 2, 3 and 4 shall accompany the goods being transported.</seg>
<seg id="78">Under Czech law, the consignee in the Czech Republic keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in Slovakia and confirms receipt of the products on copies Nos 3 and 4.</seg>

<seg id="80">The customs office shall keep copy No 4 and return copy No 3, verifying its accuracy and validity, to the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="81">The consignee shall send the certified copy No.3 no later than the next working day after its receipt to the consignor in the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="90">A single electronic system is not in place to monitor the movement of goods under suspension of duty between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="91">Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and monitoring of excisable products requires Member States and the European Commission to implement, as from 1 July 2009, an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) to enable excise authorities in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently used only in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under suspension arrangements and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products within all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">The national transport databases of each Member State will be part of this system.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transports started and finished on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Register of Selected Products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have on-line access to the system.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of transports carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, tax administrators may obtain information on the commencement or termination of transport immediately after registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in the EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the security of the tax on the transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration of the end of the transport by the customs office to the consignee competent locally.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in Slovakia use a database based on SysNed application software, which ensures the automation of their activities in the administration of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, this information is automatically transferred to the System for Exchange of Excise Data database (hereinafter referred to as "SEED").</seg>
<seg id="100">3rd Preparation and conduct of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO-Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO SR, at which a specific procedure for cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties was discussed, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">Both parties became acquainted with the legislation on excise duties and the organisation of excise duty administration in both States.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in permitting or initiating and terminating the transport of products subject to excise duty under the regime of suspension of excise duty and the exchange of information between excise administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties would: - process overall data on the quantity of products subject to excise duty transported from the Czech Republic to Slovakia and vice versa, the transport of which started in the audited period, - compare data on the transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the duty suspension regime initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the inspections, the periods examined were extended to include October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under suspension of duty was also checked during those months.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty that were transported under the conditional exemption regime between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4th Comparison of registers of transport of goods under suspension of tax</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO-CR handed over to the Slovak side a database of transports completed in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5,876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items concerned mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO SR handed over to the Czech side a database of transports completed in the Slovak Republic, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 items concerned mineral oil, 2,066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO-CR compared data on transports listed in the register of commenced transports in the Czech Republic with data on completed transports registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">The data on transports in November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the SAO-Czech Republic with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which was handed over by the SAO SR at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data allowing a reliable reconciliation of individual services and therefore only 63% of the services started were allocated.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transports were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on transports started in the Czech Republic and finished in the Slovak Republic in October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-Czech Republic with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the transports started were clearly assigned.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the quantity of mineral oils were given in litres or in tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The quantity of alcohol was in most cases expressed in litres, but it was possible to convert it into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the percentage of alcohol indicated in the database.</seg>
<seg id="118">The quantities of tobacco products were given in pieces, thousands of pieces and kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">In the case of transports started in the Czech Republic, the termination of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or for which the information on the quantity of products transported did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">The documents accompanying 487 shipments of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were scrutinized.</seg>
<seg id="121">The audit of these documents was performed at the customs offices where the SAO-CR performed the audit.</seg>
<seg id="122">For transport authorised by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested through the DG.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 shipments for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide certified copies No. 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products stated on the accompanying document did not match the quantity of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">Furthermore, data on transports registered in the Slovak database were transmitted to the Slovak side, but not contained in the transport database of the Czech Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR searched the database of the Slovak Customs Administration for 95 shipments.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 46 shipments were requested to be verified by the locally competent customs authorities, who provided copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side provided the Czech side with copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transports were also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transports carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of commenced transports.</seg>
<seg id="128">The follow-up of these cases revealed:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 transports of alcohol in a total of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transports of alcohol in a total of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005 were registered in the Slovak transport database.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-Czech Republic found that it concerned the transport of taxed products, for which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The sender informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of the transport. It carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under suspension of duty;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 transports of mineral oils, Combined Nomenclature code 2710 11 21, were registered in the Slovak Transport Database, with a total volume of 173 thousand litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity transported 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without the proper authorization.</seg>
<seg id="134">The taxable person held a special authorisation to receive and use exempt products, under which he could supply untaxed products only to the holder of the same authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="135">It did not notify the Customs Office of the start of the transports in the Czech Republic and did not provide tax security for the transported products in the amount of CZK 1,207,680.</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax subject transported 71,000 litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of Slovakia. In those cases, too, he failed to fulfil a legal obligation by failing to notify the customs office of the start of the transport operations.</seg>
<seg id="137">The transport of products put into free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the consignor in the Czech Republic without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office of this fact in writing before the transport begins.</seg>
<seg id="138">A taxable person receiving products put into free tax circulation in another Member State is required to declare the quantity and secure the tax before withdrawing them.</seg>
<seg id="139">Products may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are laid down in Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also allows the use of an accompanying document for movement under suspension of excise duty, which must clearly indicate that it is a "simplified accompanying document for fiscal control purposes (excise products)."</seg>
<seg id="141">The same legislation on the transport and reception of products put into free tax circulation in another Member State applies in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="142">In those cases, the tax subjects transported the products put into free tax circulation with an accompanying document for transport under the conditional exemption regime, the 3rd and 4th copies of which the recipient submitted to the tax authorities in Slovakia for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in Slovakia registered these transports in the transport database under the duty suspension scheme because the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the transport database of the Czech Customs Administration with the transport database of the Slovak Customs Administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- the quantities of products transported were inconsistently indicated in the databases, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it difficult to compare the quantities transported;</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of alcohol transported indicated in the invoices did not coincide with the quantity recorded in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices were listed in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- in the database of the Slovak Customs Administration were registered two transports of alcohol from the Czech Republic to Slovakia carried out in November 2004 in a total volume of 47 237 litres of alcohol, which were not in the database of the Czech Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="151">The conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the administration of excise duties were governed, until 30 June 2005, by Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office to ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise administration and to be responsible for the exchange of information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, the "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as "ELO ČR") was established at the DGC to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tasks related to the administration of systems for controlling the movement of excise goods (SEED, ISA, EWSE) and the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and Slovakia were carried out by the ELO office at the Poprad Customs Office with effect from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of ELO are carried out by the ELO Unit (based in Poprad) of the Excise Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "ELO SR").</seg>
<seg id="157">According to the provisions of Article 3 (2). Pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise ("EWSE"), - requests for verification of movements of excise goods sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System ("MVS").</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and ISA are regulated in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - a system for the exchange of information on tax subjects trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system consists of national registers of excise duty payers and enables tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to ascertain whether products subject to excise duty are traded by a person authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information held in that database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Act No. 98/2004 Coll., Section 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Coll., Section 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Coll., Section 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Coll. and Section 39 of Act No. 107/2004 Coll., ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised recipients and tax warehouses - the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in the Slovak Republic contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorized recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically connected to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Slovak Customs Administration and the Czech Customs Administration took place usually once a month, exceptionally more than once a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Slovak Customs Administration received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">Data to the database SEED in the Czech Republic are transferred from the national register, in which are registered all persons authorized to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorizations to dispose of these products.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Requests from customs authorities to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">Transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission Regulation and transport that is assessed as risky by the tax administrator are considered to be risky consignments.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is carried out in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - is sent when the specified limits are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- warning message - is sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="176">When evaluating the risk level of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database to send a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">In case the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (e.g. the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the registered office of the consignee does not match), ELO SR draws up a warning message which it sends to the ELO office of the consignee's Member State.</seg>
<seg id="178">In drawing up the reports, the ELO is governed by the regulations of the Taxation and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which determine, inter alia, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measurement for drawing up the information and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the audited period of ELO SR, ELO CR sent one warning message.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on commenced shipments of products exceeding the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database during transport approval.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it prepares a so-called warning message, which it sends to the relevant Member State through ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005 ELO CR sent two warning reports to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The ISA - the system for controlling the movement of goods - makes it possible, by means of ISA applications, to control individual movements of excise products as well as the control of a specified route of transport between the operators mentioned in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information takes place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system shall be used in particular in cases where the consignor accepts the certified copy No 3 of the movement document and requests, for example, a refund of excise duty, and in cases where the information contained in the movement document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period ELO SR sent 33 ISA applications to ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO CR sent 25 ISA requests to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often checked the data contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantity of products received or dispatched or whether the consignor of the products listed in the accompanying document was entitled to dispose of products subject to excise duty if this fact could not be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="189">The ISA application received was forwarded in both countries to the customs offices with territorial jurisdiction for the consignee or consignor of the products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="190">The customs authorities examined the data requested and communicated the outcome of the investigation via ELO to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6th Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the SAO-Czech Republic and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both countries, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the initiation and termination of the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between both countries, the records of these transports and to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">(a) the procedure followed by tax entities and tax authorities when commencing the transport of products under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="195">Transport of products under the conditional exemption regime may be initiated by a tax subject in the Czech Republic only with the consent of the tax administrator, who will authorise the start of transport on condition that the transported products have been provided with tax security in the amount of the tax applicable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The commencement of transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme in the Slovak Republic is not subject to the authorisation of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, the tax subject was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the start of transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">He could start transporting mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all Acts on Excise Duties were gradually adopted in Slovakia, according to which the consignor of goods under the duty suspension regime is obliged to send a copy of Copy No. 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office competent locally for the consignor prior to the start of transport;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for sending copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The consignee in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copies no. 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification no later than the following working day after completion of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">Certified copy No. 3 must be sent to the sender no later than the next working day after receiving it from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in Slovakia is obliged to send the consignor of the products copy no. 3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the recipient of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping such records are not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="206">Customs authorities in both countries enter in the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">For the monitoring of the movement of goods under suspension of excise duty between the Member States of the European Union, there is currently no single electronic system allowing excise authorities in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Pursuant to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products is foreseen from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of an agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of shipments of products under the duty suspension regime started in Slovakia and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 876 items concerning transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side provided the Czech side with a database of shipments of products under suspension of duty initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3 319 items concerning transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared data on transports listed in the register of commenced transports in the Czech Republic with the register of transports terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared data on transports of goods under suspension of tax initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">Comparability of the data was hampered by the fact that the quantities of goods transported were not reported uniformly in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute data on individual movements in both registers, the accompanying documents were checked and no infringements of the suspension scheme or cases of tax evasion were detected.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the basis of the findings of parallel controls, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the transport register for improving the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow the electronic transmission of the movement document and more effective control of movements under suspension of excise duty within the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of the follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxation is generally a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">So it goes without saying that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">An example is value added tax (VAT) fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are estimated to lose €100 billion each year in the European Union (EU).</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as 2005, the participants of the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Within the framework of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for supervisory cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SAO") and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, also referred to as "BRH") carried out the first parallel audit operation in the field of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not confined to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps being taken to address this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="15">1st Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (ex-post audit)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation was to examine the procedures of the financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany") and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The auditing operation was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were intended to be compared with identified good practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008, in case of relevant connections also the preceding and following periods until the completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2nd Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">Subsequent inspection of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Suspected cases of intra-community transactions have been identified during previous parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further screening.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations concerning VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up action carried out served to evaluate the actions taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspected cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also focused on selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in recovering receivables and VAT inspections of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the audit of VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors reached the following audit findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1st Recommendations from previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel inspections, a comparison of VAT registration systems in both countries revealed differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different registration methods cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for the registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation was presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also amended common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of the document agreed by the EU Member States in the framework of ECOFIN no longer contains this issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant preventive tool in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="44">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous follow-up action recommended that all EU Member States introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements in order to allow for an earlier examination of the values of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the period for submitting recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit monthly recapitulative statements was not introduced within the deadline in line with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany in order to improve the reliability of VIES data and to consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraudulent activities will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit revealed that our two Member States use different risk management systems, which have their strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO performed an audit of the EUROCANET system, which enables the exchange of information within the EU, while the BRH focused on the German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2nd Follow-up of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous auditing operation, business transactions were jointly scrutinized where there were doubts about their realization or discrepancies in the reporting of business transactions in tax returns or summary reports by taxpayers from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAIs selected for follow-up nine cases involving intra-community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The inspections carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned had not been concluded by the date of completion of our previous joint inspection operation.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent auditing operation verified that most of the tax proceedings in connection with the above-mentioned selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were concluded and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional assessments of VAT or prevention of refund of input tax).</seg>
<seg id="61">3rd Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-community transactions carried out by EU payers and included in EUROCANET were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States" participation in the scheme is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active scheme member if some Member States refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Due to the fact that the German tax administration was not involved in the EUROCANET data exchange, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the auditing operation, the SAO found cases of common business transactions as well as cases with suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent conduct concerning VAT.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrations have limited possibilities to control risky transactions, in particular as regards so-called missing traders, while the mere physical examination of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent conduct to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation arises for tax administrations when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel trades.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be advisable to ensure greater cooperation between customs and tax authorities in order to identify goods and inconsistencies in the transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is reluctant to participate actively in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools are used to detect risky taxpayers, which have so far worked well for the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">There is a need for communication and exchange of experience between EU Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU reached political agreement on a draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far from the use of EUROCANET should feed into the creation of this new network to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4th Mutual assistance in debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of processing requests for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and the BRH compared statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, SAIs agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to carry out an analysis on the basis of more detailed statistics to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates to increase recovery rates to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAIs analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control of large tax entities (hereinafter also referred to as "VDS") in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from tax administrations in the form of a questionnaire on areas considered by SAI to be essential for the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">It is clear from the responses received that the situation in both countries is developing differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system for guiding the selection of risk-prone cases based on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax audits, data from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">A dedicated financial authority for the management of VDS is planned to be established in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">To date, Germany has concentrated more on the selection of the individual cases in question, in particular on the basis of data from the VAT return and the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of these data relies on different components of risk management, which will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3rd Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Progress of the auditing operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The auditing operation was performed from May 2009 to February 2010 by Department II. - the separation of State budget revenues and territorial departments IX. Plzen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter referred to as the "FÚ"): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ in Břeclav, FÚ in Domažlice, FÚ in Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ in Kraslice, FÚ ÚT Ostrava I, FÚm Ostrava III, FÚT in Píkov, FÚ in Píkov</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion of this auditing operation was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Conduct of the audit operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Audit Service for Indirect Taxes and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the monitoring operation.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, an audit mission was carried out in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Tax Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-South) and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In preparation for parallel audit actions, a meeting of representatives of both audit institutions took place in September 2008 to discuss and define the topics of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">Finally, in December 2008, the highest representatives of the two SAIs signed an agreement on cooperation in carrying out parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At the meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the control teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the control, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on 2. - 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The review teams exchanged the findings accumulated so far and agreed on a timetable for drawing up the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">In carrying out parallel audits, both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • review of the procedure of tax administrations in the area of international assistance in recovering VAT receivables, • tax audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4th Control of VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of the recommendations of the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous auditing operation, the SAO recommended modifying the conditions for VAT registration and introducing a new rule for deregistration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The revised conditions should make it possible to reduce the risk of possible VAT evasion more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not use the right to cancel the VAT registration of payers who did not comply with obligations arising from Act No.235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed a change to the provision consisting in introducing an obligation for tax administrators to cancel VAT registration for payers in case of repeated failure to submit a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the tax payer ex officio in cases where: a) the payer has not made a transaction to the tax administrator for twelve consecutive months without announcing the reason, b) the payer fails to fulfil his obligations under this Act, c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous auditing operation, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the FVO for Prague 1 to cancel VAT registration as of 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers who did not incur any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FVO for Prague 1 often did not cancel VAT registration for these payers, as the relevant provision set an insufficient deadline for deregistration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was eliminated by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-established tax payer if the tax payer did not supply any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="135">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous follow-up action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the period for submitting recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">The summary report must be submitted by the payer even if the services for which the place of performance is determined pursuant to Section 9 para. 1 of the VAT Act, supplied to another Member State to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and where the recipient of such services is obliged to declare and pay the tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to improve the reliability of VIES data This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration performs the comparison of data on intra-Community transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech payers automatically in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore a priority area and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is evidenced, inter alia, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and actually collected levels of VAT in the 25 EU Member States (EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">On the basis of an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concludes that the estimated loss of uncollected VAT over this period is between EUR 90 and 113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous follow-up exercise noted that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO performed an audit of the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by EU taxpayers included in the EUROCANET system were selected for audit (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities in a way that allows fraud to be detected from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later become an important source of information for the risk assessment of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council already approved the creation of EUROFISC on 7 October 200812, while setting out the basic principles governing the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">EUROFISC is modelled on the EUROCANET rapid and selective information exchange system already in place, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report led to the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Payer registration conditions should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers, based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance brought the scheme to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improvements to the system are being made on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">Currently, the questionnaire data are processed electronically and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission submitted a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure the level of standards already reached in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="172">A law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="173">This law contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve higher reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group composed of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance was set up.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for the automatic comparison of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the working group dealt with an instrument designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in this exchange in the framework of the so-called Risk Management Platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and, following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform are further divided into sub-groups that deal with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influencing conduct, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports on the results of the work of these sub-groups were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of VAT registration conditions and deregistration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT tax identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">For the time being, the issue of registration and deregistration has been left to the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on the draft Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and are only obliged to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important preventive element in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome further efforts by the Commission in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly reporting of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="201">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous follow-up action recommended that all EU Member States introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements, allowing for an earlier examination of the values of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions reduces the period for submitting recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented by means of the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit monthly recapitulative statements according to a specified calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in line with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve higher reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statements systems</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO performed an audit of the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU (see chapter No. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this area, the BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The previous auditing operation jointly scrutinized the implementation of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their realization, i.e. discrepancies in the way payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT tax returns or summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="214">Both audit institutions selected for follow-up nine cases involving the intra-community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit of which was not completed by the tax administrations of both countries during the previous joint audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="215">(1)</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech payer acquired at 1. goods worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer in the quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return because the German payer was not assigned a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that, according to the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for an intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">Subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that on the basis of an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return in which he declared the acquisition of goods in the stated value and at the same time claimed a VAT deduction of the same amount in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">(2)</seg>
<seg id="221">The Czech payer had a 4. quarter 2004 to acquire goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of these goods and did not mention them in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">Upon request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authorities refused to cooperate as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax authority did not obtain evidence, it terminated the inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="225">Subsequently, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in the regular VAT return for October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">(3)</seg>
<seg id="228">The Czech payer had a 4. quarter 2004 to acquire from the German payer a passenger car worth EUR 48 500.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, therefore the tax administrator assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 0 for the quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the payer to submit an additional VAT return, which the payer did not submit.</seg>
<seg id="232">Subsequent inspection revealed that the tax administrator carried out further tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the Czech payer had sold the car in question to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax period, which additionally assessed VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the Regional Court, the Czech payer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of enforceable executions of the taxpayer's assets, that arrears appear to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">(4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was to carry out the delivery of new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany within 4. 2004 quarter and 1. 2005 quarter with a total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">A reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 revealed that tax-criminal proceedings were pending against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">During a subsequent inspection, the BRH obtained information that, after the completion of the tax procedure in Germany, it was demonstrably established that the German taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intra-Community acquisitions of goods were taxed at a value of EUR 182 424 (year 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO found that the Czech payer was involved in carousel transactions with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the examination of supplies of goods, a VAT inspection was initiated at the Czech tax entity for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the audit findings and information obtained during the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the period May 2005 in the amount of CZK 703,031 and for the period June 2005 in the amount of CZK 726,551.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was supposed to deliver at 3. 2004 quarter to Czech payer B machine worth 88 027 EUR, but payer B denied this acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="247">Subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that payer B acquired the machine from a German company that had an organizational unit established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer A did not declare the acquisition of the goods from the German payer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The reply from the German tax authorities to the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intra-Community supply of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">Subsequently, the BRH found that, following a tax inspection, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption was revoked.</seg>
<seg id="251">(6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German tax payer had 3. to deliver goods worth EUR 11,600 to the Czech payer in the quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">Subsequently, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, which unjustifiably stated the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods with the stated value.</seg>
<seg id="255">The BRH found that after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax authorities corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT worth EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">The continued movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to fiscal supervision.</seg>
<seg id="257">The recapitulative report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, because corrections of recapitulative reports in Germany can only be made by the payer who submitted the recapitulative report.</seg>
<seg id="258">(7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as to whether the Czech tax payer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After tax proceedings for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech payer with a tax liability of CZK 0 and informed the German tax administrator that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">Subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled for non-compliance in 2007 and the Czech tax administrator sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">Subsequently, the BRH found that the German payer had changed its registered office and the new locally competent tax administrator had revoked its VAT exemption on the supply of the car in question to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German tax payer has not yet corrected the data in the summary report and has filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to data from the VIES system, the German payer supplied the Czech payer with taxes in the period from 3. 2004 quarter to 1. goods with a total value of EUR 33 205 in the 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="266">Subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that the Czech tax administrator attempted to determine the causes of differences incurred by the Czech tax payer in the acquisition of goods in the period from 3. quarter 2004 to 1. 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for 1. 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the goods acquired in the amount of CZK 134 273 for the period 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005, because according to the statement of the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for individual quarters and therefore the tax administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">(9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German tax payer delivered at 3. quarter of 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854.</seg>
<seg id="271">During the same period, the Czech payer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made as part of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the delivery of goods of EUR 31,998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data entered in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Subsequent audit by the SAO revealed that after many requests from the tax administrator, the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return for the July 2004 to January 2007 tax period.</seg>
<seg id="275">In that tax return, the taxpayer also claimed the right to deduct VAT, which left the tax liability for that tax period unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The subsequent audit verified that in selected cases of business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax proceedings were completed and that the tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. additionally charge VAT or avoid repayment of input tax).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of the audit in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for the detection of risky entities within the Member State of acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending data on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="282">Within the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="283">These operators acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States were captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">As the German tax administration was not involved in the EUROCANET data exchange, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help to establish whether suppliers with a German VAT ID were assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The auditing operation revealed cases of routine commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT-related conduct.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where relevant, tax administrations have used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrations did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities continuously monitor such tax entities for inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax and VAT bases in the accounting records submitted, despite finding irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or uncovering business relationships with suspect or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• Verification of commercial transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The locally competent tax authorities mostly examined risky tax entities and risky transactions identified in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax administrations have limited possibilities when examining risky transactions, in particular in relation to the examination of missing traders , and only a physical check of documents makes it difficult to prove fraudulent conduct to the tax subject.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter VAT registration requirements and more flexible deregistration would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax subjects involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT registration takes place for the purpose of reporting fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing formally correct tax documents to payers who improperly deduct input VAT on the basis of them.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where tax authorities are suspected of being involved in carousel and other fraud and where goods are imported and exported from third countries, greater cooperation between customs and tax authorities should be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help to identify goods and inconsistencies in the transport documentation and to monitor the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of the system which should be addressed by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of the audit in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">These figures were a criterion for the selection of six German taxpayers" files for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, has refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:.in the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis for breaching the applicable rules on the confidentiality of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used within EUROCANET by other Member States.ç17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has carried out analyses of EUROCANET data and forwarded them to the Länder tax authorities in accordance with an agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relationships of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationships with traders from other Member States who also have business relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to establish a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the EU reached a political agreement on a draft regulation, the main contribution of which lies in the establishment of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained from the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the envisaged VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, the cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions seems necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance in the recovery of receivables in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The basic arrangements for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU are in particular the following directives:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order and at the same time to amend Act No 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new regulation in the system governing international cooperation for the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28. 11th 2008</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annex to the Regulation sets out the new application models to be used from 1 January 2008. 1st 2009, the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the requesting authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document are newly laid down.</seg>
<seg id="332">Key principles for the provision of international cooperation in the recovery of claims:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance shall always be provided only on the basis of a request containing the prescribed particulars;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. the assistance does not cover financial claims which have the character of a criminal sanction in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. the provision of international recovery assistance shall be carried out in accordance with the domestic law of the State requested;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims do not have priority in recovery;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has unsuccessfully used all available means to recover a claim under its law).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms by which assistance is implemented, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The locally competent tax authority shall electronically send a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance via the Financial Directorates.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance shall arrange for the translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it, including the attachments, and send it via the CCN/CSI network to the competent tax authority of the designated State.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two basic requirements for recovery: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and not more than 5 years old.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse recovery.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">When receiving an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the application as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to grant the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal and indicate the specific provisions of the Directive on which it relies.</seg>
<seg id="349">Such notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application meets all the requirements under the law and should immediately forward the application via the Financial Directorate to the locally competent tax authority for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator examines, among other things, the debtor's assets, e.g. by obtaining extracts from the Land Register, checking accounts in banks, verifying the registration of vehicles at the Transport Inspectorate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">After a period of six months from the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities where recovery is not possible, the applicant authority should also be informed thereof.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any sum recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not excluded that a Czech tax administrator recovering foreign receivables may allow a delay in its payment or payment in instalments if the consent of the state which requested the recovery is given.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the period of enforcement, the debtor is ordered to pay interest or penalties in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">Such interest or penalty shall be due to the State which requested recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of accepted requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not forward the requests for processing to the locally competent tax administrators in time, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the framework of international assistance in the recovery of receivables as well as in the case of requests received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The auditing operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll. because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State about the progress in recovery within six months from the date when the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 para. 191/2004 Coll., processes statistical data for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery sent or received in the past year, indicating the amount of claims to which the requests relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">On the basis of the evidence provided by all EU Member States, the European Commission draws up a report on the state of recovery and submits it to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data as a result of an error in the item of recovered receivables in 2008 by EUR 5,250 thousand, stating the incorrect value of the recovered receivable on VAT (it was a shift of the decimal point after conversion of the receivable from Czech crowns to the value in euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">This error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance, including the amounts recovered, is provided in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International assistance for debt recovery in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal authorisation for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and the Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In the interests of more accessible wording and better readability, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the Act (EC) on the collection of State taxes of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The recovery procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code emphasises that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities which are applicable in national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Law on Administrative Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) lays down statutory provisions governing the recovery procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative acts of the tax authorities are governed in particular by the instructions for execution and the instructions for enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with the representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance for the assessment of taxes and transferred its own responsibility in this regard to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general prerequisites for making requests for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• Legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic means of enforcement have already been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• Claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.</seg>
<seg id="382">• From the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. is no longer subject to appeal), no more than 5 years may elapse before the date of submission of applications.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the relevant foreign office, such as the Czech CLO, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">The further procedure is governed by the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 Currently, the Working Group of the Federal Government and the Land Governments is reviewing this methodological guideline in order to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The application, including the annexes, shall be submitted electronically by the Financial Office to the Intermediate Office.</seg>
<seg id="388">That authority shall check the correctness of the application in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the application is not correct, it shall be returned to the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it meets all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Revenue Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and will also provide a translation of the application.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery received from other Member States are registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt is sent within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check that the formal requirements have been met.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the Intermediary Office, which then forwards them to the competent tax authorities and monitors their execution.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the processing of the application takes more than 6 months, the Intermediate Office shall invite the submission of an interim report to be submitted pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">Once the formal and factual elements of the request have been checked, the implementing services shall notify the method of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any sums recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of their receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as of 31. 12. 2008) are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Monitoring of recovery, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">Within the framework of international cooperation, 21 requests for international assistance in the recovery of receivables between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for audit.</seg>
<seg id="404">The examination of ten selected cases revealed, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="405">1st</seg>
<seg id="406">On the 20th. 10 a.m. 2006 the Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany a request for recovery of VAT receivable for the years 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of EUR 3,883, i.e. CZK 109 820, with the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the tax administrator a request for recovery until 26. 2nd 2008</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since it was not possible to pay the entire enforced debt even by pledging the real estate, a repayment schedule was agreed with the Czech tax entity with instalments of at least CZK 2,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31. 8th 2009 information on the state of recovery was sent to the German tax administration, stating that as of 25. 8th In 2009 this receivable was partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49 600.</seg>
<seg id="411">That sum was sent to Germany and then on 28. 8th In 2009, another instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="412">2nd</seg>
<seg id="413">The Czech Ministry of Finance received on 7. 1st 2008 application for recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 180 869 in Germany, i.e. 4 434 915 CZK, for VAT and income tax and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the tax administrator until 27. 11th 2008</seg>
<seg id="415">By examining the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable property, the tax administrator found that the debtor does not own any exequatable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Furthermore, a local investigation found that the debtor had not resided at his permanent address for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 June 2005. 4th 2009 and on 16. 4th 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="419">3rd</seg>
<seg id="420">The Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany on 21. 11th 2007 request for recovery concerning tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech tax entity in the amount of EUR 3 139, i.e. 84 846 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim on 6 June 2005. 8th 2008 to the tax authorities, although already on 18. 2nd 2008 The Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the receivable in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">The Czech Ministry of Finance on 9. 12. 2008 informed the tax administrator that the request for recovery is settled by payment of the receivable by the Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also paid in the context of recovery in the Czech Republic and paid to Germany on 27 July 2005. 10 a.m. 2008</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time periods within which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorized tax administrators, the receivable was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and by the Czech tax administrator's recovery of the receivable.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been included in the claim arising from a further recovery request of EUR 6 649 to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance only registers a request for recovery of a claim of EUR 3 139 with this company; the request for recovery of a claim of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance with the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="427">4th</seg>
<seg id="428">The Czech Ministry of Finance received on 15. 9th 2008 from Germany an application for recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity which owed in Germany in respect of income tax and VAT and accessories the amount of EUR 39 957, i.e. 956 654 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19. 12. 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1. 6th In 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated, execution was ordered for the ordering of the receivable in accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and for the deduction from wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7,000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax authority found that the tax entity had been willing to repay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="433">The tax entity promised to discuss the application with the German tax authorities with a view to obtaining a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">Enforcement of the receivable continued during the SAO audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19. 11th 2007 The Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany a request for recovery concerning a Czech tax entity that owed income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories totalling EUR 113,444, i.e. 3 116 304 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the ÚO for Prague 1, which is responsible for administering the tax for non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14. 11th 2008, because it was not possible to identify the locally competent tax administrator on the basis of the tax entity's address.</seg>
<seg id="438">During the investigation, the FCA obtained information that the debtor had on 19. 9th 2008 income in the amount of EUR 4 704; however, the FCA could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the request for recovery only after this date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On the 26th. 1st 2009 The Czech tax administrator initiated the recovery of the receivable and issued an execution order for the attachment of the receivable to the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.</seg>
<seg id="440">Enforcement of the receivable continued during the SAO audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="441">6th</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation in recovering the VAT claim and the costs of the proceedings in the total amount of CZK 146 223 742 on 3. 10 a.m. 2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax authorities until 13. 5. 2008</seg>
<seg id="444">The German tax authorities of 8. 9th 2008 transferred to the Czech authorities through the Federal Bank the amount obtained from the execution of funds in the debtor's account in the amount of EUR 17 700, i.e. 439 226 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="445">An error in the recalculation of the amount recovered was found during the verification of the amount recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The amount recovered was CZK 146 223 742 converted at the rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 erroneously to EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct conversion of the amount to be recovered is EUR 5 833 781,83.</seg>
<seg id="448">A request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7th</seg>
<seg id="450">The Czech tax administrator on 1. 3rd 2007 sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover the tax arrears from the Czech tax entity, which owed CZK 1,970,632 for VAT and accessories, i.e. EUR 79 847.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax authorities until 10. 11th 2008</seg>
<seg id="452">The German tax authorities of 4. 2nd 2009 called on the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant declines in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: 4th 2009 amount of EUR 4 600, 6. 5. 2009 amount of EUR 3 000 and on 16. 6th 2009 amount of EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On the 23rd. 6th 2009 the German tax administrator agreed with the debtor that by 30. 6th 2009 will pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="456">8th</seg>
<seg id="457">Request for recovery of a total amount of EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including a claim for real estate transfer tax, was delivered from the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 June 2017. 5. 2008</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 February 2005. 10 a.m. 2008</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3. 4th In 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified the refund on the ground that the transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (b) of the Sixth Directive. (e), (f), (g) and (b) (h) Council Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax authorities further stated that Article 2 (b) of the Sixth Directive provides: (g) relates to claims relating to income tax and wealth tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and capital, which are listed in Article 1 (2). 3 in conjunction with par. 4 of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to prepare and submit a new request for recovery, excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax in the amount of CZK 61 759 and indicating arrears of VAT, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be resent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same tax entity that owes CZK 7,079,735 in income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9th</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6. 2nd In 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed CZK 3,445,782 in personal income tax and VAT, i.e. EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of this amount, VAT accounted for CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax authorities until 18. 4th 2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax authority a reply from the German tax authority dated 9. 7th 2007 to 11. 11th 2008</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax authorities had issued the tax on 11. 6th 2007 an execution order to a bank account at the bank, which however stated that it had no business relations with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">The German tax authorities therefore considered the application to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="473">On the 26th. 9th 2005, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845, i.e. EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The request from the Czech tax administrator was delivered to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10. 10 a.m. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">Czech Ministry of Finance on 15. 12. 2005 sent a request to the German tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed an execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and a deduction from wages and established a lien on the immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16 June 2008. 3rd 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">From the reply to the request for information received by the Czech tax authority 16. 9th 2005, it emerged that the Czech tax entity resides in Germany and had an income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activities.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20. 4th 2006, but did not forward it to the Czech tax administrator until 12. 2nd 2008</seg>
<seg id="480">The reply stated that no recovery procedure could be initiated in Germany because of the debtor's insolvency - he had not been found to have any assets and his non-business income was already subject to another enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German tax authorities therefore considered the request for recovery to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of processing requests for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and the BRH compared statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay more attention to keeping their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of discrepancies in statistics had decreased even though the number of applications had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important to revisit statistical issues at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should show the annual number of claims as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of claims recovered by each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by the Member States, as this can assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that the recovery rate can be calculated broken down by Member State is seen by both SAIs as useful for Member States with lower recovery rates to step up their efforts to improve the recovery rate at least to the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery of receivables to the locally competent tax authorities on time.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax authorities from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The auditing operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of receivables, because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State about the progress in recovery within six months from the date when the request was confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General Information Inc.</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as those of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for the inspection of VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period stated in the personal/corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion. CZK or higher.</seg>
<seg id="504">The inclusion of the tax entity in the VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A tax entity ceased to be classified as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax years from the end of the period in which it submitted the tax return on the basis of which it was classified as a VDS, its net turnover for the tax year fell below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">A tax subject could not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax inspection of at least one tax per tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were checked at least on a five-yearly basis until the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax subject must be carried out at least every 2 years and the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax must be eliminated by the chosen follow-up procedure.</seg>
<seg id="509">The SAO audit is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator usually chooses several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The VDS were audited by the specialised audit units, which are set up at a total of 13 FCAs, or by the staff of the audit units of the locally competent FCAs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The Specialised Inspections Unit shall carry out tax inspections within the limits of the powers laid down by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities operating in unusual and specific lines of business;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities for which it is extremely technically and time-consuming to carry out a tax audit;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with a large territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• Entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and undue evasion of excess deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax audits carried out by the specialised audit units of the FCA and the results of these audits are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No.531/1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists in establishing a specialized FCO with nationwide competence for selected tax entities (including legal entities established for business purposes which have a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion). CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General Information Inc.</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT inspections of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax inspections in general, i.e. The relevant provisions are laid down in the following regulations: • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • the Tax Control Regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory provisions on inspection are laid down in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - On-the-spot tax inspection. In particular, these articles lay down rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot tax inspections (i.e. on the premises of the undertaking), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules on the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of inspection, the taxpayer's obligation to cooperate and the prerequisites for carrying out the final examination and communication of the inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Administration Act According to Article 5.1 (1) in connection with Art. Participation in on-the-spot tax inspections carried out by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Revenue Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax inspections shall be agreed between the participating authorities on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that specific undertakings which it selects be subject to inspection at a time to be determined by it.</seg>
<seg id="530">In that case, it may promulgate rules on the conduct and content of the inspection at the premises of those companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Rules on tax inspections According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the rules on tax inspections (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament, in which the Länder governments are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative provisions apply to on-the-spot checks carried out by the Länder tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">The undertakings are classified according to size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Under Paragraph 33.1 of the BpO 2000, each informed tax authority must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the following guidelines set out the additional methodology for tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• A single manual for special VAT inspections in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="539">• a USLO manual setting out the methodology for the use of VIES data on intra-Community business relations;</seg>
<seg id="540">• a ZAUBER manual setting out the methodology for the use of the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• Working aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits depending on the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to be inspected - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular inspection intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">As a general rule, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Inspections are usually announced including VAT inspections.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that during the audit, checks will be carried out definitively in particular on income taxes, excise duties and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT inspections may be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisational structure of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax years covered by inspections is usually between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 foresees a control period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">The subject of the examination is all taxes of the company.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Control management of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of VDS inspections carried out, but focused on management issues in order to obtain an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT inspections at VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax administrators on areas they consider essential for managing this issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses concerning VAT control at VDS are available to the management of tax administrations?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or rate records distinguishing between the fight against VAT fraud and VAT control in general?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such a distinction in the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between an inspection designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT inspection.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of VAT checks (linked to the time period of the transactions audited)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Records on the timeliness of inquiries with relevance for intra-Community acquisitions of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, data such as how long the interview took are also part of the information recorded in ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average time of the last check (year information).</seg>
<seg id="566">This data does not provide an overview of selected control periods with regard to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; they also have the right to carry out VDS inspections.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the statistics produced at federal level for the special VAT inspection services do not provide information concerning the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there any statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenues generated, broken down e.g. according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the tax subject has unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">(ii) only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. moving a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);</seg>
<seg id="572">(iii) additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the volumes of additionally assessed tax broken down by type of tax, by the number of audited tax subjects and by the number of audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local enquiries, accusation procedures) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Time data and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">General debt statistics are also kept broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax recorded by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and for VAT special inspection services do not distinguish between these criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Moreover, most of the tax administrations visited do not distinguish between these differences either.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are the control areas resulting in high additional revenues recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to select tax payers for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach between the Finance Ministers of the Länder and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must enter their assessed increased tax (VAT) liability if it exceeds a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, it must specify, for example, the nature of the tax increase charged.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS claim an unjustified right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to § 72 para. 1 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which have been used for representation pursuant to § 75 para. 3 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents that did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 para. 1 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Section 21 para. 1 of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It has been noted that there are no rules at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">VAT findings are not separately recorded by the Länder in so far as they result from VDS tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder have to enter their assessed increased tax (VAT) liability if it exceeds a certain amount, the Federal Central Revenue Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of areas of control that give rise to a high "revenue" and draw consequences for management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or on the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide data on audit areas that generate high "revenue."</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the analysis process as well as on the materiality management of cases.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the replies of both Member States show that the Czech Republic ensures a system that collects a wealth of data from tax audits carried out, as well as data from financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss accounts.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, it is planned to establish a specialised financial authority in the Czech Republic for the management of VDS.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax authorities do not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">This makes it more difficult to carry out these tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on the selection of individual cases on the basis of data from the submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help to reduce VAT gaps.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the revenue from VAT collection will increase and the rate of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel audits of VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">Both SAIs have gained a better understanding of each other's systems in the following areas: • intra-Community transactions; • VAT risk management, in particular as regards the selection of risk-prone transactions; • assistance with the recovery of VAT claims; and • VAT control for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies as well as differences in the above-mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and good practices were identified.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, the two SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within the Member States, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="624">6th Communiqué</seg>
