<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel checks carried out in 2005 on the administration of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted material informs about the progress and results of the parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolní úradom Slovenskej republiky, which focused on the area of value added tax administration and the use of the information system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The parallel control actions were mainly aimed at checking the procedure of tax authorities in examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between individual Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of VIES has enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on the commercial transactions carried out by them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the VIES data and the data in the VAT return submitted by the taxpayer should alert the tax authorities to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit of the parallel checks carried out was not only the exchange of information on the procedure of the tax or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular the examination of the use of the VIES system in the control of the application of the right to exemption from value added tax in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lessons learned from the implementation of parallel controls will contribute to the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel checks on the administration of value added tax for the period 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (CZ) 05 / 19 (SK) 22 / 2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and the performance of VIES tasks for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SAO, Czech Republic") and the Najvyššší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as "SAO SR") concluded a contract on cooperation in audit activities on 12 September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of the parallel audit actions "Administration of Value Added Tax," included in the plan of audit activities of the SAO, the Czech Republic for 2005 under No 05 / 19 and "Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of taxes on added value and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system on the list of informants among the member landscapes of the EÚ," included in the plan of audit activities of the SAO SR under No 22 / 2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The control actions carried out in parallel were in the nature of coordinated control.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated control was processed within the meaning of the European Enforcement Regulation No 31 for the INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent provided for by the contract concluded and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of supplies and acquisitions of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic ("the Czech Republic") and the Slovak Republic ("the Slovak Republic").</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties have contractually agreed to provide each other with information from public sources, from the electronic system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests for the examination of business transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the regional unions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited entities were the Ministry of Finance and 12 tax offices: The tax office in Mladá Boleslav, the tax office in Cologne, the tax office in Teplice, the tax office in Karlovy Vary, the tax office in Tábor, the tax office in Brno III, the tax office in Znojmo, the tax office in Zlín, the tax office in Šumperk, the tax office in Ostrava I, the tax office for Prague 7 and the tax office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the Slovak SAO in cooperation with the expositions of the Slovak SAO Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: The Bratislava I Tax Office, the Komárno Tax Office, the Trenčín Tax Office, the Prievidza Tax Office, the Zvolen Tax Office, the Dolný Kubín Tax Office, the Košice II Tax Office, the Košice V Tax Office and Michalovce Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of the checks:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of the tax and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") following the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "the EU") and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited period of coordinated control was from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States that allows tax authorities to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and allows the country of destination to check whether the acquirer has correctly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">The VIES system is not centralised within the EU; each Member State develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit found differences between the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">Recapitulative statements show the value of supplies of goods to other EU Member States, and the value of services provided is not included in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States included in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the Slovak Republic, data from summary reports submitted by Slovak taxpayers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and the value of supplies of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values reported in the recapitulative statements with the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and to identify any differences between them.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the values of goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on the common line of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, in the Slovak Republic, the system does not allow the automatic identification of differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the value of supplies of goods in VAT returns makes it possible to use the results of data comparisons to check the VAT exemption for supplies of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">The data received from recapitulative statements submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed into CLOs and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods stated by payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia respectively in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the Slovak Republic, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences to examine.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) will determine which quantified differences between the values of supplies and acquisitions of goods must be examined by the tax authorities and will send a list of these cases to the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that, for the most significant variations, it will be examined whether the VAT on the acquisition of goods has been declared at the correct level.</seg>
<seg id="43">The audit also highlighted some problems in the VAT administration system due to the complications caused by the different reporting of intra-community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Recapitulative statements are made in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Shortening the reporting period to one month, together with shortening the processing period, would allow earlier access to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">This would allow tax authorities to check more effectively whether VAT on intra-Community purchases has been declared at the correct level.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax year (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer has declared identical values of supplies of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">The differences between the values of delivery of goods reported by EU payers and the values of acquisition of goods reported by Czech and Slovak payers were due, among other things, to the different reporting of data on intra-community delivery and acquisition in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in recapitulative statements, or the reporting of intra-community supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than intra-community acquisitions in the customer's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">Harmonising the conditions for the reporting of these data within the EU would make the control activities of Member States' tax administrations more efficient.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was also focused on the examination of selected intra-community transactions between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicions of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of Slovakia found, among other things, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">Tax entities have declared in their VAT returns, for the purpose of improperly obtaining an excess VAT deduction, the carrying out of intra-Community transactions which have not actually taken place;</seg>
<seg id="55">Tax entities reported intra-community supplies in carousel transactions where there was a deliberate multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw excess VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">In their VAT returns and recapitulative statements, suppliers declared intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">The suppliers made intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to tax entities not registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">Suppliers declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than those declared by purchasers of intra-Community acquisitions, in some cases where VAT was declared at an incorrect level.</seg>
<seg id="60">The findings of the audit exercise showed that VIES provides tax authorities with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrations should pay particular attention to the rigorous examination of differences between data reported by VAT payers and data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax procedures.</seg>
<seg id="62">The issue of value added tax after the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">After joining the EU, internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within the EU have been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="66">Until 30 April 2004, the tax authority was the competent tax authority, with the exception of the import of goods and occasional bus services in the country, where the tax authority was the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In connection with the adoption of the new Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter "Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll.") and Act No. 222 / 2004 Z. z., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter "Act No. 222 / 2004 Z. z."), the administration of VAT on the acquisition of goods and services (previously imports) from other EU Member States passed from the customs authorities to the tax and tax authorities respectively.</seg>
<seg id="68">The supply of goods in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 13 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">The supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the supply of goods that have actually been dispatched or transported to another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="70">Under the provisions of Section 64 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. it is an exempt taxable transaction with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are delivered to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">In the Slovak Republic, according to the provisions of Section 8 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z. Z., the supply of tangible property in which the right of ownership is changed is considered to be a supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="72">The transfer of goods owned by a taxable person from the territory of the country to another Member State shall also be regarded as a supply of goods where those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">Under Section 43 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z. z., the supply of goods from the country to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the person acquiring the goods is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="74">The acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 16 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods which are dispatched or transported to the purchaser by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Czech payer purchases goods at a price excluding VAT and is obliged to declare VAT in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of Section 25 of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., if the conditions set out in the provisions of Section 73 of this Act are met, he will be entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">The acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic from another EU Member State in the Slovak Republic under the provisions of Section 11 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z. z. means the acquisition of the right to dispose, as owner, of movable tangible property dispatched or transported to the customer by or on behalf of the supplier or the customer to the Czech Republic from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">Tax liability in the Slovak Republic arises when the payer acquires goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State according to the provisions of Section 20 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z.Z.</seg>
<seg id="78">The payer can deduct VAT under the provisions of Section 49 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z. Z. if the tax is charged by him on the acquisition of goods in the country from another Member State under the provisions of Sections 11 and 11a of this Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">According to the provisions of Section 17 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., or Section 45 of Act No 222 / 2004 Z. z., trilateral trade is a trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States, where the object of the trade is the supply of the same goods between the three persons.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intra-community transactions are supplies and acquisitions of goods between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="82">Vies system</seg>
<seg id="83">A VAT information exchange system has been set up within the EU to monitor the application of VAT exemptions for intra-Community supplies of goods.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows EU tax authorities to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and vice versa, whether the acquirer duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State develops its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">National systems operate on a common principle and are interconnected through a common EU communication network, the CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was connected to an automated tax information system ("ADIS"), in the Slovak Republic to the application software of the tax information system ("APV DIS").</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by the tax and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU Member State obtains information on tax entities that it would not have been able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is the fight against tax evasion and losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, each Member State establishes, within the internal organisational structure, a central unit in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the management of VAT, known as the Central Liaison Office (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance - the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (hereinafter referred to as "MF CLO") has been established, performs tasks arising from international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The function of CLO in the Slovak Republic is performed by the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Department of International Administrative Cooperation ("DR CLO").</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments communicate with EU foreign administrations mainly in the field of VIES information exchange, spontaneous information and information exchange at the request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, verification of tax identification numbers (TIN) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States, and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to examine a particular intra-Community transaction or to obtain further information relating to a particular tax entity, the tax and tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via MF CLO and DR CLO respectively.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States which they can use to correctly determine VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information between EU Member States' CLOs are mostly sent in electronic form, using a standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic focused mainly on the examination of selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two states and on the level of use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation by the financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">In 30 cases, the SAO, the Czech Republic requested the SAO to examine business transactions between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">The SAO asked the SAO, the Czech Republic to examine in 10 cases business transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">An examination of intra-community transactions revealed, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="105">O</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, the Czech Republic asked the SAO of the Slovak Republic to examine the procedure of the tax administration, to which a reply to a request for information was sent.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak Tax Office, using the SCAC form, requested verification of the supply of goods (footwear) in the third quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer in the value of 2 847,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer only stated the purchase of goods with this value in an additional VAT return and delivered the same goods back to Slovak tax entities with a value of CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">On the basis of the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the locally competent tax office fully recognised the Slovak supplier's right to an excess deduction of VAT arising from, among other things, this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">This tax office did not provide information on the suspicion of re-export to the tax authorities of the locally relevant customers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">This will provide an incentive for further investigation of business activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">O</seg>
<seg id="113">The Czech tax authority asked through the SCAC form for verification of the delivery of a technology line to SR worth CZK 4,850,000 in the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax procedure carried out in SR showed that only part of the technology line was delivered, and components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">In examining this case, the SAO SR found that the VAT on the taxable transaction carried out was declared by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850,000 in the VAT return ("DAP") for the tax year 7 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO, Czech Republic also found that the Czech payer reported an excess VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 in his DAP for that quarter, which was due to the application of a VAT deduction on the purchase of this technology line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">On the basis of the results of the investigation, the Czech tax office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities created a business relationship for the purpose of illegally obtaining an excess VAT deduction, questioned the performance of the taxable transaction and did not recognise the Czech payer's part of the right to deduct the tax in the amount of CZK 647,000.</seg>
<seg id="118">O</seg>
<seg id="119">In 2004, the Slovak tax authority asked through the SCAC form for verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer in the value of 24,246,000 Sk made in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">In November 2002, the Slovak payer bought these goods from another tax entity in Slovakia, worth 29,667,000 Sk, and then sold them to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity has claimed an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax year.</seg>
<seg id="122">In a tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administration and did not file a DAP for the fourth quarter of 2002 or the following period.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO SR found that on the basis of the result of the tax audit, the Slovak tax administration did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of 5,541,000 Sk applied in the DAP for the month of 11 / 2002 and established the tax liability of 1,750,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted an exemption from VAT in respect of the export of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">O</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax authority received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the acquired goods for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to data from VIES, the Czech payer was to purchase goods (diluent) worth CZK 3,767,000 from Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax authority, it did not file a DAP and the VAT for the months 7 to 12 / 2004 was assessed ex officio in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax authority asked through the SCAC form to check whether deliveries of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic took place, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In reply, the Slovak local tax office sent a copy of the invoice, the consignment notes and a request for payment of the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO SR found that the Slovak payer had been granted an exemption with the right to deduct VAT on this supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech tax authority assessed the response to the request for information received from the Slovak Republic as evidence showing that the company had purchased goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the basis of further investigation, the tax office in the Czech Republic will ask the superior authority for a review of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">O</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (particle board products) to, among others, an American company, which stored these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of this free zone was identified on the invoices as the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, for example, an American company purchased $57,600 worth of particle board from a Slovak payer (at a unit price of $100 per piece), which it placed in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred ownership of the goods to a Swiss company, worth USD 14,400 (unit price of USD 25 / piece), and the goods were exported back to SR.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic but left the area of the free zone on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax authority initiated tax inspections of individual tax years 2004 and 2005 at the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="141">The verification of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech local tax authorities through several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">The individual responses gradually created a picture of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO SR, found that in these business relations, there was a deliberate multiple decrease in the value of goods.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the information gathered, the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic concluded that in this case of the carousel trade it is free price formation (i.e. the import of undervalued goods and their overvaluation by domestic companies located in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a violation of the VAT Act in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="145">Under current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be prevented as they meet all the conditions of the law to exempt supplies from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="146">O</seg>
<seg id="147">The Czech payer's VAT registration was cancelled on 12 July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="148">On 27 October 2005, following a voluntary application for VAT registration, the company became a tax payer again.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the month of 8 / 2005 (i.e. the period when he was not a VAT payer), the Czech tax entity entered into the DAP the value of the purchase of goods (printing press) from the Slovak Republic in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to a supply of goods from a Slovak payer in the amount of 1,530,000 Sk, which the Slovak payer stated in the DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax authority requested to verify the said supply using the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier did not prove how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech payer does not cooperate with the tax authority and does not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax authority in order to verify the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">O</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer included in the summary report for the third quarter of 2004 the delivery of goods worth 956,000 Sk to a tax entity from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">The VAT number of the Czech entity was marked as incorrect by the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="157">Verification in the database of payers revealed that such TIN was never allocated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to the invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly work on real estate in the Czech Republic, not the delivery of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax authority requested to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, the Czech Republic, by asking the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, found that the tax entity listed on invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not declare the tax on received services from the Slovak entity and did not declare the tax on the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">Neither the local investigation nor the tax audit was carried out on the Czech entity, its current residence is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authorities learned that the Czech tax entity had become a VAT payer by law by accepting the service.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax audit for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="165">O</seg>
<seg id="166">In the summary report for the third quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer declared the delivery of goods worth 1,055,000 Sk to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">It was not a supply of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but a supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax authority requested to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, the Czech Republic, by asking the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the delivery and a local investigation was carried out to examine the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that the present case was not really about the acquisition of goods, but about the acquisition of services, which the Czech entity also reported in the regular DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">The tax office also found that the Czech entity did not pay the correct amount of VAT for the tax year of the third quarter of 2004 as a result of a bad procedure in the calculation of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="173">The taxpayer submits an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">The SAO SR, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the Slovak payer had erroneously stated the provision of the service in a summary report and would be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">O</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech tax entity has voluntarily registered as a VAT payer since 10 March 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For the first quarter of 2004, DAP reported a high turnover in both input and output.</seg>
<seg id="178">The locally competent tax authority initiated tax proceedings, the entity did not cooperate with the tax authority, so due to suspicion of involvement in the carousel business, it was charged VAT of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="179">No further DAP was submitted by the payer.</seg>
<seg id="180">His VAT registration was cancelled on 4 January 2005 due to a failure to comply with his obligations under the law.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to data from the VIES system, this entity was to purchase goods worth 7,846,000 Sk from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the execution of these transactions, the Czech tax authority sent two requests for information to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="183">The SAO SR, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the manager of the Czech company denied in a witness statement that the transactions examined had taken place and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">On the basis of the tax procedure carried out in the Slovak Republic, the intra-Community supply to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be recognised as entitled to the VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">O</seg>
<seg id="187">According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (work clothes) from the Slovak Republic in the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of 39,970,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="188">In this quarter, the Czech payer reported the purchase of goods from another EU Member State only in the DAP for the month of 3 / 2005, worth CZK 11,292,000.</seg>
<seg id="189">The local tax authority carried out a local investigation with the entity to check the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">Since the company did not submit any documents or otherwise prove the performance of taxable transactions, on 9 June 2005 the tax authority charged it VAT in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="191">In May 2005, the tax authority sent two requests for information to the Slovak Republic due to doubts about the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the reply to the requests for information, the tax authority in SR had doubts about the execution of the business cases and about the execution of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out with the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated inspection, the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic carried out further investigations concerning the Czech entity and at the same time an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was under way.</seg>
<seg id="195">O</seg>
<seg id="196">The following two cases involve companies suspected of being involved in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions in goods (work clothes) were carried out between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak payer No 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No 3, who delivered them back to SR payer No 4 (see diagram No 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">(A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech payer No. 2 was to purchase goods (work clothes) worth CZK 4,847,000 from Slovak payer No. 1 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods worth CZK 17,050,000 in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the local tax authority sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic on 25 May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="203">In reply, the Slovak tax authority expressed doubts about the execution of the business cases as well as the execution of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8 June 2005, a request for information was received at MF CLO from SR concerning goods worth 16,575,000 Sk, which were to be delivered by Slovak payer No 1 to Czech payer No 2 in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side demanded to check whether the Czech payer No. 2 actually received the goods, declared them in DAP and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">An official record drawn up by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech payer No 2 has not been based at an address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax year, he submitted DAP for a quarterly tax year.</seg>
<seg id="208">In view of this, the Czech tax authority was not able to assess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">In view of the above, it was not possible to verify the performance of the taxable transaction between Slovak payer No 1 and Czech payer No 2 mentioned in the application for the amount of 16 575 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax authority suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel business for the purpose of drawing an excess VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="211">(B)</seg>
<seg id="212">Czech payer No. 3, who deals with the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of months 1 and 2 / 2005, in which he declared the supply of goods (work clothes) to Slovak payer No. 4 for a total value of CZK 21,935,000.</seg>
<seg id="213">These work clothes were to be purchased by the Czech payer No 3 from the Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to SR, which was mainly aimed at verifying whether Slovak payer No. 4 purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from Czech payer No. 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="215">The reply to this request for information received from SR showed that in the DAP for the month of 12 / 2004 the Slovak payer No 4 stated a zero value for the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for the months of 1 and 2 / 2005 he stated a value for the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State of only 1,193,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="216">Slovak payer No 4 did not respond to the invitation to submit tax documents for the tax period from 10 / 2004 to 3 / 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">A local investigation carried out in SR revealed that the company was not located at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">The reply further stated that this payer fulfils all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administration had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out on the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">In the course of the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax authority collected documents that would confirm or deny the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be measured according to the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Police of the Czech Republic is also investigating the case.</seg>
<seg id="223">Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of parallel audit events, a coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO SR took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants in this meeting were acquainted with the VAT legislation in both countries and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The negotiations resulted in the specification of the scope of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">The two parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: (A) verification of the validity and correctness of the VAT registration numbers of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic for intra-community supplies; (b) verification of data on intra-community purchases listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of payers from the Slovak Republic contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on business transactions carried out.</seg>
<seg id="228">It was also agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be carried out following the volume of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intra-Community Transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The following diagram illustrates the process of processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic during the intra-Community supply and acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intra-Community Delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer carries out an intra-Community supply, he is obliged to submit an SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic provides in the SH summary information about his supplies of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in the Slovak Republic is obliged to enter in the SH the value of goods that have been exempted and delivered from the Czech Republic to other EU Member States during the calendar quarter period.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the goods delivered are always presented in SH in Czech and Slovak currencies, broken down by individual tax entities, with an indication of their VAT number, under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Data on services are not included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has given incorrect data in the SH, he is obliged to submit a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the payer in SR finds that the information given in the SH was incomplete or incorrect, he will file a corrective SH before the deadline for submission of the SH, after which he is obliged to file an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system allows for the exchange of information on the registration data of VAT registered payers in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic can check whether the VAT number of the relevant customer is registered in the EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">The data from the submitted SH are grouped on MF CLO and DR CLO by VIES according to the individual VAT numbers of the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The aggregate value of all deliveries for each customer's VAT number and the code of the method of fulfilment from all its Czech and Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, will be created.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from the L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (from L1QD files) is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="245">If VIES in another Member State detects the wrong TIN of the customer in the L1QD files sent, it generates a so-called O _ MCTL message, which contains all the wrong TIN, indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is then sent to MF CLO and DR CLO respectively.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O _ MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: Formally incorrect TIN, TIN is not registered in the country or has never been allocated, the customer with a particular TIN was not a VAT payer in the quarter, the customer's VAT registration was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from the received O _ MCTL reports to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the wrong VAT number of an EU payer is used in one of the SH lines sent or subsequent SH lines, the so-called "VAT ID Doubt Notification" is generated by ADIS at the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office will check whether the delivery to a VAT-registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In SR, DR CLO will process all O _ MCTL messages in the VIES system and send them electronically to the local tax authorities together with the identification of the taxpayers who have entered the wrong VAT number in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities then invite the payer to submit an additional SH and state the valid TIN, or the tax office will check the delivery of the goods with the relevant payer when declaring the invalid TIN in the submitted SH.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of erroneous VAT numbers relating to intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are given in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="254">Out of a total of 41,728 VAT numbers of Czech payers listed in SH of Slovak payers in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 VAT numbers were incorrect, i.e. 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Out of a total of 62,997 VAT numbers of Slovak payers, listed in the SH of Czech payers in the same period, 416 were incorrect VAT numbers, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-community transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer incorrect VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="257">An examination of the activities of the tax and tax authorities found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although, when questioned by the tax administration in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in the 4th quarter of 2004, the O _ MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation revealed that the termination of the marketing authorisation did not take place until 1 January 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO SR also found that 6 tax entities submitted SH, in which the wrong VAT number was mentioned, but the O _ MCTL reports did not contain these VAT numbers.</seg>
<seg id="262">In SR, the submitted SH will be converted into electronic form at tax offices and the data from them will be sent to DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">Following the subsequent processing of these data in VIES, DR CLO will send to the relevant tax authorities the so-called breakdown of errors in SH submitted by tax entities for the relevant quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH as of 26 July 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the audit) and as of 2 February 2006 (i.e. data processed after the end of the audit).</seg>
<seg id="265">A comparison of the data is presented in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="266">The above data show that the audit of the SAO SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with an incorrect VAT number (by an average of 199 SH per quarter), but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH (by an average of 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-community supplies given by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intra-community supplies given by the payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax authority should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data collected to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values given in SH and DAP in these cases was CZK 537,231,000.</seg>
<seg id="272">Since the third quarter of 2004, the ADIS system has allowed the tax administration in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values listed in SH and DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community supplies according to SH as a match and to set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intra-community supplies in one quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a not insignificant amount, so tax authorities should not set the SH and DAP match in these cases without explaining the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, without verification, the tax authority set the match for a difference in values of CZK 1,561,000.</seg>
<seg id="275">The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was complicated by the fact that SH for each calendar quarter was submitted by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">The tax authorities were not able to compare the values of intra-community supplies listed in these DAPs with the values according to SH for payers with the monthly tax year at the time of filing the DAP for the first two months of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax authorities only became aware of any discrepancy between the data in DAP and SH when the tax liability or excess VAT was assessed or refunded.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-community transactions within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, data received from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered by L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, the data are converted at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the value of the acquisition indicated by Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of acquisitions of goods reported by payers in the DAP should be in the range of the minimum and maximum converted value of L1QD (L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in the DAP is less than L1min, a "verification order" is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are passed on to the local tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders relating to the audited tax authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, Czech Republic found that in 33 cases the audited tax authorities did not check the irregularities in the values of the intra-Community acquisitions referred to in the verification orders received.</seg>
<seg id="288">In these cases, the total difference between the values stated in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers was at least CZK 148,319,000.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, Czech Republic selected 533 files of tax entities for inspection, for which the audited tax authorities received a verification order from the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="290">The inspection found the following most common causes of differences between the values stated in the DAP of the customer and in the SH of the supplier: On the part of the customer (Czech payer) in 263 cases the customer did not declare the acquisition of goods in the regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than in which he was obliged to declare the tax, in 6 cases the customer stated the value of the purchased goods in the wrong DAP line, on the part of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases the EU payers included in their SH the values of the services provided to the Czech payer, of which 54 were Slovak payers, in 39 cases the suppliers included in the SH the supply of goods in a different tax period than the Czech purchasers in their DAP, in 22 cases the suppliers stated in the SH the incorrect VAT number of the Czech payer, in 16 cases the suppliers stated in the SH the incorrect values of the supply of goods, in 12 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1 May 2004, in 5 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value of the advances received.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the part of Slovak payers, the value of the services provided was most often erroneously included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were found at the audited tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 was due to the fact that the Slovak payer introduced the provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods, including assembly in the territory of the Czech Republic) into SH for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of received advances in the SH, for example 2 Slovak payers reported received advances from Czech payers in the SH, as a result of which an order was generated to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to authenticate procured goods are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where there is subsequently a change in the data from the SH in the EU Member States, such as a change in the customer of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES system does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the locally competent tax authority of the purchaser of the goods may not, without any other initiative, know about the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax liability on the acquired goods and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">An audit of the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred, for example, in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer stated in SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of the delivery of goods to the Czech payer in the amount of 1 504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1 February 2005, the tax office with local jurisdiction sent a request for information to the Czech payer in Slovakia, because the Czech payer only admitted the purchase of goods in the amount of CZK 425,000.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 1 March 2005, in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538,000 Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from 194,000 Sk to 1,160,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers reported in their SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 an intra-community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic totalling 10,240,000 Sk (i.e. 8,183,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech buyers did not report intra-Community acquisitions in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of an international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, who was not mentioned in the SH submitted by the Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the first quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intra-community deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of 10,240,000 Sk in the additional SH relating to the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the local tax authority in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data submitted by the DAP for the second quarter of 2004, even though the actual acquirer did not comply with the obligation to declare intra-Community acquisitions for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, Czech Republic found that based on the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech payer was additionally charged VAT for the tax years 5 and 6 / 2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640,000 and for the third quarter of 2004 in the amount of CZK 3,305,000 on purchased goods during these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">It can be seen from the above that tax authorities had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences arising from errors in the customer's DAP, but also differences due to different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">Harmonising the conditions for the reporting of these data would make the control activities of the tax authorities more effective.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="311">In SR, the APV DIS system makes it possible to compare data on the value of purchased goods obtained through VIES from other EU Member States with data contained in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which data are compared is called the "min-max method."</seg>
<seg id="313">This method is used to convert the delivery values of goods listed in the SH of payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">There will be a min-max interval, which is used for comparison with the values of the purchase of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">Dr CLO will send information to the tax authorities on the values of intra-Community acquisitions listed in the DAP and the values of EU supplies in the VIES.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax authorities will decide for which VAT-registered persons the difference will be checked, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of data provided by DR CLO, the SAO SR selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at the audited tax offices, of which 25 payers also purchased goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences were found between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and those declared in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="318">The audit carried out by the SAO SR confirmed the fact that the tax authorities did not rigorously check the differences obtained using the min-max method and thus did not check the accuracy of the data contained in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations into specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the audit of the Slovak SAO at the tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies, where VIES showed significant differences in min-max values when acquiring goods from EU Member States, the following facts were found, inter alia:</seg>
<seg id="322">In the DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not indicate the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that a company from the Czech Republic had erroneously declared the VAT number of this payer in SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while goods worth CZK 19,184,000 were actually delivered to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Slovak company was to purchase goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria worth MIN 682,692,000 Sk and MAX 715,105,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">The company filed a DAP for the periods in which it stated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU at only 480 599 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax authority carried out a local investigation and found that the tax entity had purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and DAP did not list intra-Community deliveries according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">In view of further irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax authorities will request an examination of the value of the goods delivered using SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">The acquisition of goods from EU Member States in Q4 2004 was not mentioned by the Slovak payer in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11,286,000 Sk and MAX 11,845,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Tax Office carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity did not purchase any goods from EU Member States in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO recommended that the tax office ask for verification of supplies of goods from EU member countries using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">The VIES system reported the delivery of goods to a Slovak customer worth MIN 557,000 Sk and MAX 565,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the DAP, for the tax period from 10 to 12 / 2004, the payer did not declare any acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">A local investigation by the tax authority found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier in the Czech Republic on 10 December 2004 for the material consumed during the repair of the hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO recommended a tax audit of the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the audit of the SAO SR, in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax audits will be submitted by the tax authorities after they have been carried out by the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="340">Examples include:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak acquirer did not mention the acquisition of goods from EU Member States in the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004 and did not declare any tax for the tax period from 10 to 12 / 2004 and claimed a refund of excess VAT for a total amount of 1 236 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax authority carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity had purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth 683,000 euro (approx. 27,080,000 Sk).</seg>
<seg id="343">The goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Slovak payer issued an invoice to customers in the Russian Federation for the amount of EUR 683,000, which he did not mention in the submitted DAP.</seg>
<seg id="345">The tax authority carries out a tax audit of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 and the supply data reported by payers from EU Member States in each quarter was a total of 4,800,000 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers in the Czech Republic and Belgium and then sold them to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by the single export declaration.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of goods in DAP was not mentioned by the tax entity, according to the company's manager, the goods in transit were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records to the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">A tax audit has been initiated on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International exchange of information level L3</seg>
<seg id="353">The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by locally competent tax authorities, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "JOI") or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as "SPI") relating to a particular tax entity or transaction through MF CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="354">Dr CLO to another EU Member State. The aim of ŽOI is, for example, to prove the execution of a given transaction in the context of intra-community transactions, to check a certain VAT number, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of an SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for replying to an EOI was set at 3 months in Article 8 of this Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for the admissibility of applications are governed by a decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which stipulates that, unless otherwise agreed by the participating States, an EOI must relate to commercial transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500, excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">Where an EOI relates to a commercial transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond in view of its workload.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure for processing incoming ŽOI by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of the internal time limits set for processing at each organisational level, is illustrated in the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the Slovak Republic, the deadline for processing ŽOI by the tax authorities was set internally at 2 months in order to comply with the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="362">MF CLO received a total of 29 ŽOI and 3 SPI from Slovakia from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 IOUs received, 26 (89.7%) were discharged within the stipulated time limit of 3 months and 3 (10.3%) were discharged after that time limit.</seg>
<seg id="364">During the same period, DR CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 received by the JOI, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were dealt with within the stipulated time limit of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were dealt with after this time limit (for the remaining 2 cases it was not possible to determine the time limit from the submitted material).</seg>
<seg id="366">The following graph contains more detailed data on the processing time of IOUs received by MF CLO and DR CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="367">The reasons given on the SCAC forms for sending a JOI are set out in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT has been examined, as well as the use of VIES to exchange information between EU Member States, in particular when monitoring the exercise of the right to exemption from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation has made it possible to examine selected intra-Community transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="371">An examination of the selected transactions revealed that, based on an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries detected cases of companies carrying out fictitious intra-Community business transactions in order to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not declare VAT on the received supplies of goods at the correct level.</seg>
<seg id="372">The audit also revealed differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also highlighted problems caused by the different reporting of data on intra-community supplies and purchases of goods in different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">Harmonising the conditions for the reporting of these data within the EU would make the control activities of Member States' tax administrations more efficient.</seg>
<seg id="375">An examination of the procedure of the tax and tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system revealed that the tax and tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal powers.</seg>
<seg id="376">In addition, it was found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and the validity of the VAT registration of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the audit, with data processed after the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="378">Comparing these figures, it was clear that the audit of the SAO SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with misstated VAT numbers, but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In the event of irregularities in the reported data, the SAO asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such an option under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The findings of the audit exercise showed that VIES provided tax authorities with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">As there is still scope for tax evasion in this area, there is a need to pay close attention to intra-community transactions when managing VAT.</seg>
<seg id="383">Communiqué</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material gives an overview of the progress and results of the parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Najvyšší kontrolní úradom Sloven-skej republiky, which were focused on the area of value added administration and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the supreme audit authorities of the two countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement on control activities concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel control actions was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes make a significant contribution to the revenue of the national budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of value added tax, which allows for the refund of excess deductions, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise duties, especially on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">In view of the need to address this issue comprehensively across the European Union, the VAT Working Group has been set up by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, in which the highest audit offices of both countries are actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the framework of the planned indirect tax controls, aimed in particular at involving the tax authorities of both countries in the VIES system, which allows the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union to be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the audit of the administration of value added tax and excise duties for the years 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Control number: (CZ) 04 / 07 (SK) 18 / 2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Control of the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="18">On 11.2. 2004, a contract for cooperation in audit activities was concluded between the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as "SAO") and the Najvyššší kontrolní úrady Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter referred to as "SAO SR"). The object of the contract was cooperation in the parallel audit actions "Value Added Tax and Excise Tax," included in the SAO's audit activity plan for 2004 under No 04 / 07 and "Control of the procedure of the tax administration, control and enforcement of taxes on added value and spot taxes," included in the SAO SR's audit activity plan under No 18 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the contract concluded and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the inspections.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the contract, the two parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the database of the customs administration and from the files of tax entities kept by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the respective state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic"), the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the regional unions of South Bohemia, North-East Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected tax offices: The Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 3, the Financial Office in České Budějovice, the Financial Office in Frýdek-Místek, the Financial Office in Hodonín, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Kroměříž, the Financial Office in Písek, the Financial Office in Rožnov pod Radhostem, the Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Velke Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SR") was carried out by the Tax and Customs Administration Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the expositions of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">Bratislava Tax Office for selected tax entities, Bratislava III Tax Office, Trnava Tax Office, Pú-chov Tax Office, Banská Bystrica I Tax Office, Liptovský Mikuláš Tax Office, Žilina I Tax Office, Žilina II Tax Office, Košice I Tax Office and Košice IV Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="26">Objective of control</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the control actions was to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of the tax and customs authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties, with a focus on the collection of these taxes on the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of the international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the respective tax and tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Recap of inspection results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">In the framework of international cooperation, the SAO handed over 22,206 items of single customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCDs") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic from the Czech Republic's customs database, while the SAO handed over 30,221 items of JCDs from the Slovak Republic's customs database.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison was made between the designated JCD items from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic and the Customs Database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of the 5,883 selected JCD items from the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Out of the 12,343 selected JCD entries from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were allocated.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the basis of the non-allocated items of the JCD, a selection of the files of tax entities was carried out at the tax and tax offices, for which the declared imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">On the basis of the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the financial and tax authorities, the implementation of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified in the territory of the second state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO SR carried out a joint pilot inspection at the border customs crossing point Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, in which the two parties worked closely together to verify the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not find shortcomings in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="42">In the area of international cooperation, the audit of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic focused on imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, and possibly other types of goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">Based on the audit of the files of tax entities at selected financial and tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of the implementation of exports of goods declared at 40 JCDs with a total statistical value of 15,301,093 CZK and the SAO asked the Slovak Republic for verification of exports with a statistical value of 56,989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and SAO SR found, among other things, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="45">- trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the Czech customs database and the Slovak customs database,</seg>
<seg id="46">- an error in entering data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports;</seg>
<seg id="47">- for some exports from the Czech Republic, corresponding imports to the Slovak Republic have not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="48">In such cases, there are reasonable grounds to suspect fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming deductions of value added tax;</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax entities have failed to comply with certain statutory obligations when declaring imports and exports in value added tax returns;</seg>
<seg id="50">- weaknesses have been identified in the activities of the tax and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their cooperation with the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of value added tax and excise duties, attention will continue to be paid to international trade in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrations in the administration of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">Effective control of excise duties is based on the control of the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the situation in the field of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax ("VAT") was levied by the tax or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out within the territory of the country and by the customs authorities on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">The tax revenue for the tax authorities was due to the difference between the collected own tax liability and the refunded excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="58">VAT revenue at the customs offices was determined by the amount of tax collected by them.</seg>
<seg id="59">In accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, the tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the tax deductions applied to the tax authorities or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most tax and tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the key taxes in terms of state budget revenue, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and about 42% of the tax revenue of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="63">The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned amounted to a total of CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">The total collection of VAT in the Slovak Republic amounted to CZK 83.8 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="65">In 2003, the tax and customs authorities collected Sk 187.0 billion in VAT and the excess VAT deductions recovered totalled Sk 103.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise duties</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as "SPD") was carried out by the relevant tax and tax authorities and, on imports of products subject to SPD, by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="68">The share of the SPD in the tax revenue of the state budget in the Czech Republic was about 16% in 2003 and about 19% in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total collection of SPD collected in the Czech Republic by the tax and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to CZK 85.6 billion and in the Slovak Republic it amounted to CZK 38.0 billion.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage, a comparison was made between imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic; in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used in the mutual verification of the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and in the checks carried out on the territory of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of the control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and SPD checks was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">A coordination meeting took place in November 2003 at which, among other things, the selection of commodities - types of goods which posed a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax legislation was agreed: - ethyl alcohol and spirits, tariff headings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff headings 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out: (A) from non-allocated items found by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports on a regular or one-off basis in large volumes, (c) on the basis of findings from inspections carried out by selected tax and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, the mechanism for cross-referencing JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, part of the exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits, denatured, of any strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages;</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste;</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with the ends cut off), cigarillos and cigarettes of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences;</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus containing reception equipment: For the cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus containing reception apparatus:</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with the apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">JCD items from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were assigned to each other on the basis of the conformity of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle carrying the cargo, date of crossing of the national border, tariff item, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and graphs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The fact that trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides made it difficult, among other things, to match imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic, declared on one export JCD, were declared on several import JCDs in the territory of the Slovak Republic, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that had an impact on the success of the assignment were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as well as the time difference between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of another country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited tax and tax offices respectively.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports or exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, some tax entities were selected for the verification of business transactions reported in VAT returns, where data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot check at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing point</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing point for the performance of the pilot inspection was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of non-allocated JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="100">On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of control sheets has been introduced at border customs crossing points between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic since 1 June 1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate as far as possible customs and tax evasion, to provide an overview of the movement of means of transport carrying goods of a commercial nature in the customs area and to create the conditions for comparing customs records with each other.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot inspection was carried out between 8.3.2004 and 26.3.2004 and was aimed at examining this system of customs control.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of checklists at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing point:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Weighing the vehicle, issuing a checklist and handing it over to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Putting the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs discussion in the check-in hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, Police of the Slovak Republic, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The completion of the check-in process was confirmed by the individual files by stamping on the checklist.</seg>
<seg id="108">(3) Landing the vehicle in the area where the physical inspection is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the checklist, JCD or other documents to the customs official - check that all prescribed acts and documents have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="110">Carrying out a physical check by the relevant services.</seg>
<seg id="111">Release of the vehicle from the customs area.</seg>
<seg id="112">When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing of vehicles was carried out directly by the staff of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When the goods were imported into the Slovak Republic, the weighing of the vehicles was carried out by the staff of an authorised legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">After consideration, the vehicles were registered in a computerised register.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="117">The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Checklists and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="120">When exported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these checklists in the electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">Of the 453 JCD items, the SAO SR found 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the staff of the Drietoma border customs crossing.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">When exporting from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Out of a total of 339 JCD items of the selected audit sample, the SAO, in cooperation with the staff of the Starý Hrozenkov border customs crossing, assigned the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets to 295 JCD items.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by the staff of the Drietoma border customs crossing and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The audit of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic did not find shortcomings in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing point.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected control findings in the verification of commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">In the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified on the basis of documents from customs administrations and financial and tax authorities in the territory of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="130">For the selected tax entities, the following were verified:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,</seg>
<seg id="132">- the fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the VAT deduction on importation, the refund of excess VAT and the application of the VAT exemption on exportation.</seg>
<seg id="133">The verification of the commercial transactions revealed:</seg>
<seg id="134">1. The SAO asked the Slovak Republic to verify the implementation of the export of alcohol with a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="135">The SAO identified the corresponding imports in the Czech customs database with a statistical value of CZK 42,624.</seg>
<seg id="136">2. The company involved in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories claimed an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in the VAT return for December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="137">In order to check the reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCDs (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.</seg>
<seg id="138">The SAO SR identified 3 corresponding import JCDs (17 items) with a statistical value of 1,724,321 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="139">VAT was paid to the competent customs office in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="140">3. The company, whose business was mainly trading in optical equipment, claimed in 2002 a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4,1,36,000 higher than the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="141">The SAO selected an export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124 for the verification of the reported business activities.</seg>
<seg id="142">The SAO SR found that this JCD corresponds to an import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of 9 653 827 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="143">VAT was paid to the competent customs office in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="144">4. The company involved, inter alia, in the purchase of goods for resale and sale, did not declare any exports of goods in the VAT returns submitted in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 totalled CZK 3,439,888.</seg>
<seg id="146">Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 669,839 for verification.</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) with a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="148">An audit by the SAO of the Slovak Republic at the relevant tax office showed that the declared imports had been carried out and VAT paid.</seg>
<seg id="149">5. The company, whose business was, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and equipment, reported exports of goods worth CZK 12,966,706 in VAT returns in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the total value of exports in 2002 was 14,474,381 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="151">The SAO presented 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO SR identified 13 JCDs (50 items) in the SR customs database with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="153">The SR customs database failed to identify the corresponding import JCDs for 4 export JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of 399,776 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="154">The competent tax office in Slovakia verified these imports with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer to the Slovak Republic, stated in the minutes of the local investigation that it did not carry out the imports declared on the Czech export JCDs.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO of the Slovak Republic therefore asked the local competent tax office to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate tax for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="157">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the company involved in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers with a statistical value of 7,338,199 CZK in 2002 and 12,228,545 CZK in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="158">The company did not declare any exports in its VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification, with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.</seg>
<seg id="160">In addition to the 4 export JCDs (4 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,246,860, the SAO SR identified 7 JCDs (7 items) with a statistical value of CZK 2,919,514 in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="161">The corresponding imports could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">The software company did not declare exports of goods in its VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630,198.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected 9 JCDs (9 items) for verification in the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of 755,588 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the SR customs database, the SAO SR identified 8 JCDs (8 items) with a statistical value of 915 601 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="166">The corresponding imports could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In these cases, it was not possible to identify in the SR customs database the corresponding imports to 6 JCDs with a statistical value of 692,800 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- for the 2 export JCDs from the Czech customs database with a statistical value of 293,024 CZK, the corresponding import JCDs could not be identified in the Slovak customs database (see paragraphs 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error rate in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number ("TIN").</seg>
<seg id="171">It is therefore not possible to conclude with certainty that those exports were not made.</seg>
<seg id="172">- 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic did not show imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a statistical value of 399,776 CZK (see paragraph 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, there are reasonable grounds to suspect the fictitious export of goods for the purpose of improperly claiming the VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services as part of the control of selected tax and tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in respect of imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the tax and customs authorities, the files of tax entities were selected at the audited tax and tax offices according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic: (A) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">(A) the VAT deductions applied on importation, (b) the excess VAT deductions applied, (c) the right to a refund of the SPD, (d) the VAT exemption applied on exportation,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. tax entities that have been subject to a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="180">The sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination, with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Control of the selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="184">At the audited tax offices, the SAO focused mainly on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure followed by the tax authorities to verify the accuracy of the VAT declared;</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration;</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparing data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices, focusing on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparing data on the JCD and accompanying invoices with data in the customs database;</seg>
<seg id="188">- comparing data from VAT returns on transactions carried out and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at tax offices or in the customs database;</seg>
<seg id="189">- the method of verifying entitlement to VAT exemption on the export of goods or services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax offices contained only records of those imports and exports for which tax entities were required to declare imports or exports on the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited tax offices examined the files of tax entities, which reported imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 and corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052,000 in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="193">In addition, the files of tax entities reporting exports worth a total of CZK 47,323,111,000 in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were checked.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 and 2003, the tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were examined carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT of CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.</seg>
<seg id="195">The observed differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items that were missing from the Czech customs database were requested directly from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- JCD items that were missing from the tax authorities' database were checked for cancelled documents;</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items, which were found to have different values between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the tax authorities, the relevant JCD was requested from the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form, including the attached invoices.</seg>
<seg id="199">The investigation revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCDs with a total value of VAT of CZK 3,622,000 and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences identified</seg>
<seg id="201">A comparison of the JCD database at the tax offices and the cumulative tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns of a selected sample of tax entities revealed the following differences:</seg>
<seg id="202">The differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time lag between the realisation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct the VAT charged on the importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The taxable person could exercise the right to deduct on importation of the goods within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the goods were placed under the relevant procedure or, in the case of the temporary importation procedure, within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the procedure ended.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time lag between the realisation of the export and the moment when the taxpayer received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The taxpayer was obliged to enter data on realised exports exempt from the obligation to apply output tax in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax year in which the goods left the country, if he also had a tax document, which was a JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to comply with the obligations of tax entities when declaring imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax entities did not provide correct data on imports and exports in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">As tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT returns submitted, the control of the right to deduct VAT or the exemption from VAT by the tax authorities was made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Cooperation between financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the audited period, import or export duties and VAT were repaid or remitted on the basis of decisions taken by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="212">The tax entities were required by law to reduce the previously exercised right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for information on changes in the level of customs duties and VAT to be sent from customs offices to tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some of the audited tax offices received this information, but irregularly or with considerable delays, and only from some customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information about changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the data necessary to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002 the customs authorities returned VAT in the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of more than CZK 398 million.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit revealed persistent shortcomings in the activities of the tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the failure to comply with certain obligations of taxpayers submitting VAT returns and the SPD.</seg>
<seg id="219">Weaknesses were identified in the VAT and SPD administration, in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">(A) when VAT registrations are cancelled, the fulfilment of the obligation of the payers to pay VAT on the business property registered or which should have been registered on the date of the deregistration, for which the payer claimed the deduction, was only rarely verified;</seg>
<seg id="221">(B) the tax authorities have not consistently used the possibility to carry out a tax audit or a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">This has in some cases led to a lack of verification of the right to deduct VAT;</seg>
<seg id="223">(C) the official records and minutes of the oral hearing do not contain all the necessary information to prove the validity of the excess VAT deductions claimed;</seg>
<seg id="224">(D) the tax authorities have not sufficiently verified the imports and exports declared in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in SR</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Control of the selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample, the SAO audited or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the submitted tax returns and requests for tax refunds from selected tax entities, the SAO asked the tax office to secure the relevant JCDs showing imports and exports, invoices and proof of payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO SR checked whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the decisive facts and legal conditions for the application of the deduction of input tax in respect of imports, for the refund of excess VAT, for the application of the export tax exemption and for the reimbursement of SPD.</seg>
<seg id="230">At the 10 tax offices audited, the SAO of the Slovak Republic verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in a structure according to the honour of JCD items and the sum of statistical values shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports with a statistical value of CZK 856.2 million were checked, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked for a total statistical value of 176 million SK, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white technology, packaging technology and software) from EU countries to the Slovak Republic were checked for a total statistical value of 532.8 million SK.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Cooperation between tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO of the Slovak Republic's audit at the tax offices found discrepancies between the data registered in the Slovak customs database and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (natural persons) declared imports of goods with a total value of Sk 1 589 261 in their tax returns, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the initiative of the SAO SR, tax entities were not able to prove to the tax office that the application of the input tax was justified by the relevant documents on the realisation of imports and the payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- in the tax return for the tax year January 2003, the tax entity (s. r. o.) declared the taxable transaction received in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods in the value of 18 006 041 Sk and claimed an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">According to the VAT returns submitted for 2003, the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of Sk 59 161 535, which arose in January 2003, was not made up during the whole of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the cases mentioned above, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excess VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 stated in the VAT returns the export of goods with a total value of 87 199 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="242">A verification in the SR customs database revealed that the tax entity had made exports with a statistical value of SKK 296 747 during the period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Tax Office carried out a number of local inquiries at the company's head office, finding that the manager of the company (a UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the rented premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the audit of the SAO SR, the tax administration filed a complaint with the law enforcement authorities on suspicion of the crime of non-payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit at the selected tax offices, the SAO SR notes that the biggest problems in the performance of the administration and control of VAT and SPD occurred mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- not making use of the possibility to carry out VAT checks on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases where the high value of excess VAT deductions is applied;</seg>
<seg id="247">- the tax inspection reports did not contain an inventory of the audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCDs for the import and export of goods;</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient verification of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns;</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy procedures for tax administrations to issue decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, with the consequence that the right to impose penalties ceases to exist;</seg>
<seg id="251">- failure to comply with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals;</seg>
<seg id="252">- failure to compensate for VAT arrears by the deadline for the refund of excess VAT;</seg>
<seg id="253">- under-utilisation of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">On the basis of the findings of the audit, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of VAT, focusing on the legitimacy of the claimed excess VAT deductions for 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">At all audited tax offices, measures have been taken to remedy the shortcomings identified by the audit, the implementation of which will be monitored and audited by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and has highlighted shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The inspections also resulted in the identification of persistent deficiencies in the performance of VAT and SPD obligations, in the activities of the tax and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="259">The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic as part of the tax information system. In the Slovak Republic, there is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between the customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT administration and the SPD was not the same, due to the different legislation and conditions in the territory of the two states.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained at the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and from documents available at the audited tax offices. The SAO of the Slovak Republic verified the execution of business transactions from documents of tax entities requested through the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel VAT and SPD checks carried out assessed the state of the administration of these taxes in the period before accession to the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further enhanced in the monitoring of the activities of the tax and tax authorities in the context of the adoption of the new VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This declaration must be made by all VAT payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrations are required to enter data from recapitulative statements into the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES), which is accessible to tax administrations from Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="268">The tax and tax authorities then have the opportunity to compare these data with the data contained in the VAT returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is also used to verify the validity of the VAT registration number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied when goods are delivered to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel audit actions has shown the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these control actions will be confronted with the results of the planned control actions, which will focus, among other things, on the examination of the VIES system, which is designed to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-community supplies."</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SPD for budgetary revenue, control activities need to focus primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the scope for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of checks at asylum facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State property and funds intended to secure the activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Control Action No 04 / 23 "State property and funds intended to ensure the activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior"</seg>
<seg id="4">Control action No 15 / 2004 "Control of the economy with staff and financial resources for the provision of asylum and temporary refuge in the Slovak Republic"</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the global phenomena that has become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is mainly due to the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, in particular for reasons of race, religion, nationality, politics, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to gain asylum and integration into society, especially in one of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">A large group is also made up of foreigners, whose migration is due to unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, the acceptance of which the governments of the signatory countries undertook to apply in their foreign policy orientation, has already resulted in the establishment of specific principles for refugee assistance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federal Republics ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the separation in 1993, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with accepted international documents and confirmed their binding force under national legislation by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both Republics have also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyššší kontrolný úradom Slovenskej republiky, the results of which are contained in the joint final report, focused on the asylum process and related issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">The cooperation between the supreme audit authorities of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the "Treaty on Cooperation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as "the Treaty") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Treaty, the two Parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing the asylum procedure in the State of the other Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences for the area of population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information to the extent provided for by the Treaty and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">The first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4 to 7.4.2004, set out the same areas of control issues and control procedures for the preparation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6 to 30.6. 2004, the common items for the programme of the control action were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the third joint meeting, which took place during the inspection mission from 8.11 to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience on the ongoing inspections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The modalities of the outcome of the checks have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was drawn up from 14.2. to 17.2.2005 at the last joint meeting, has been provisionally established.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by inspectors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited persons were the Ministry of the Interior ("MV") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior ("SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, it carried out inspections of the defence section, vnútra and štátnych úradov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited entity was the Migračný úrad Ministerstvo vnútra SR ("MÚ").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 (the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data over a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recap of inspection results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of parallel checks was: - the asylum process, - asylum facilities, - the management of state funds and assets, - the internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of experience between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyššší kontrolní úradom Slovenskej republiky took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of the control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange allowed for a more thorough evaluation of the submitted supporting documents, an analysis of the causes of the identified differences in the security of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, it was possible to focus on the critical problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the end, this had a positive effect on the quality of the control work carried out.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum laws of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union (EU) documents was the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation in this area continues after the accession of the two countries to the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has been on a steadily increasing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">Within the meaning of international agreements, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="44">The national budgets of both countries allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until asylum is granted or not granted, as well as the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">Some of the doses collected are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have set up asylum facilities in which they have gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="48">During their stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care and basic material and hygiene equipment.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and the conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres as well as integration centres in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost per day of stay depends on the occupancy and equipment of the centre and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stable.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1 000 jobs in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, an increasing number of whom are expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the provision of services. The decisive expenditure of this item was expenditure on accommodation and meals for applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenditure on health care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also accounted for a significant share of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by a number of budgetary measures addressing legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services were a decisive factor in the absorption of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings which did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of the state's assets.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were mainly shortcomings in the use of state budget funds, contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act, when current expenditure was used to cover actions in the nature of technical evaluation of fixed tangible assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Act on Accounting in the Field of Inventory and Non-Compliance with the Accounting Curriculum was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property when it was transferred to another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in land registry data violated the Land Registry Act and the Waste Act was violated by leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorised for waste management.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, deficiencies were also found in the provision of excessively high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in the award of public contracts and in the management of the state's assets, when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of liquidating unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation in force governing the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some shortcomings identified, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenské republiky are positive about the progress of SUZ and MÚ in providing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyššší kontrolný úrad Slovenské republiky note that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the inspection were discussed with the interested statutory representatives of the relevant organisational units of the state on both the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the inspection be used in other joint control actions within the framework of international cooperation between supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the subsequent 1967 New York Protocol).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No 498 / 1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic, Act No. 325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum and amending Act No. 83 / 1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been in force since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="76">This law has been amended five times (Act No. 2 / 2002 Coll., Act No. 217 / 2002 Coll., Act No. 320 / 2002 Coll., Act No. 519 / 2002 Coll., and Act No. 222 / 2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two other amendments to Act No.325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No.325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding force.</seg>
<seg id="79">Even as part of the adoption of this law, efforts were made to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when asylum law became part of Community law from 1.5.1999 on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has led to the need to create appropriate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments that are legally binding.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the inspection by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">Once they have been implemented in the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it has implemented the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of the state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was laid down with effect from 1.1.1996 by the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No 283 / 1995 Z. z., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No 480 / 2002 Z. z "on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws, which incorporated the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Council of Europe Directive 2001 / 55 / EC of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for the provision of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to Act No.480 / 2002 Z. z., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with the EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course on the basics of the Slovak language during their stay at the integration centre, the appointment of a guardian by the courts for underage foreigners if they are staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, the possibility for applicants to enter into an employment relationship in certain circumstances, as specified in the amendment to the law.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU law in the area of migration and the asylum process has been evaluated in the European Commission's regular reports on preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report highlighted the lack of staffing in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. The asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, refugee issues have been the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice since 1990.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 January 1996, the Ministry established the organisational arm of the state of SUZ. This was due to the separation of the administration's performance in the field of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to participants in asylum procedures and asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry performs decisive tasks in the area of the asylum process, in particular from the point of view of the financial and material-technical security of the asylum process, to the extent defined by specific regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to the decision on applications for asylum by foreigners in the first stage of the administrative procedure and the complex operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, meals, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it is preparing concepts for the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the development of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have been significantly influenced by the cooperation and support provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A particular benefit was his financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing stock for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="100">UNHCR has also co-funded social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Evolution in the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic can be found in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">A total of 394 cases were granted asylum during the period under review, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">A total of 22,731 asylum cases were not granted during the period under review and 22,636 asylum procedures were discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties to the proceedings at 1.1. includes both those to whom the decision has not yet been issued and those to whom the decision has not been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="108">It also includes people who have been excused from missing the deadline for lodging an appeal, or whose previous decision has been overturned and a new one has not yet been issued.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is on a steadily increasing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10,358.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, when 1,556 people applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are presented in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylum applications were granted during the audited period and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants per year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">A total of 23,088 asylum procedures have been closed.</seg>
<seg id="116">The majority of applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without permission, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002 it accounted for more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants, and in 2003 it was already more than 94%.</seg>
<seg id="118">The duration of one applicant's stay in an asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The findings of the Ministry also show that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In such cases, the asylum system is used for a purpose by applicants.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, does not qualify for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">According to the provisions of Section 12 (1) (a) of Act No 480 / 2002 Z. z., on asylum, such an application should be considered manifestly unfounded and decided upon within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognised principles to identify economic migrants are not yet in place to distinguish them from those persecuted in their country of origin and to speed up the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country from the point of view of international migration and the destination countries for migration were and remain Western European countries.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement designating the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple asylum applications from being made in more than one EU country.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants shall return to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the external borders of EU countries, so the application of the Dublin Convention may in the next period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create the conditions to stay in the Slovak Republic until a decision is taken on whether or not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Execution of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of the international agreements and the national legislation based on them.</seg>
<seg id="131">The national budgets of both countries allocate the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on the granting of asylum and their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The increasing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the doses collected are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, during the audited period, the meal allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, the allowance was CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child under the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per day was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to the allowance, asylum seekers accommodated in residential centres with separate cooking and those accommodated in private outside asylum facilities can be granted a contribution up to the minimum subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No 325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, inter alia grants municipalities the right to a contribution to cover the costs incurred in connection with an asylum facility on its territory, in Section 84.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the allowance was determined annually by government resolutions and during the audited period it was CZK 7 per person per day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to an allowance to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil per month during the audited period, on condition that the person attended school for a minimum of 10 days in that month.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, during the audited period, the meals were 70 Sk per person per day, the allowance was 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per day of stay averaged 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">In accordance with Act No 480 / 2002 Z. z., on Asylum, municipalities in whose territory there is an asylum facility are granted a contribution towards the partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and operation of the asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">So far, municipalities have only partially used the possibility to apply for the allowance, which is set at 1,500 Sk per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries provides for a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure for issuing asylum decisions, while allowing for an extension of this period in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is to appeal against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the asylum application (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their start.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to MÚ data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the legal option of extending the deadline by lodging an appeal with a court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and at the time of the inspection the court proceedings had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="154">Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of the joint offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Úrad hraničnej a cudzineckej polície Policajný zboru in the reception centres in Adamová-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Liptovský Vlachoch, which took place at the time of the inspection from 1 October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This is intended to simplify procedures and shorten the time limits for procedures between the two components of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established asylum facilities in which they have gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to participants in asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="158">During their stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket money and basic material and hygiene supplies.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and the conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">Suz manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing state property in the premises of the reception centre Vyšní Lhota, the reception and residence centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">Suz also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntále, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal person on the basis of Section 80 (3) of Act No 325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of the accommodation centres is 1,977 seats.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities which asylum seekers are not allowed to leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception procedures referred to in Act No 325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="166">A breach of the obligation to stay in a reception centre is classified as an offence.</seg>
<seg id="167">The accommodation centres to which asylum seekers come from reception centres are used to house asylum seekers until the decision on their application for asylum or non-asylum becomes final.</seg>
<seg id="168">Subject to certain conditions, asylum seekers have the option of leaving or staying in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, food, other services and pocket money in reception and accommodation centres where they are declared to be staying, provided that they have taken the necessary steps to establish their financial and financial situation, and these conditions are such that they cannot be fairly required to pay even part of the said services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for the temporary accommodation of people who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months, with the possibility of an extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or they can arrange it themselves as part of the state integration programme.</seg>
<seg id="172">At the integration centre, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons granted refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">For the comparison of asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best indicator of the cost per physical day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of persons who have actually been provided with services provided by the asylum facility each day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, the facilities operated by the SUZ are designated as own and those operated by legal persons under Section 80 of Act No. 325 / 1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of a single day's stay in the SUZ's own asylum facility is decreasing with the increasing fulfillment of these facilities. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of operating the facilities are allocated to more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers is increasing in direct proportion to the growing number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, applicants were accommodated in their own asylum facilities in a crisis capacity.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, extra accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to deal with the capacity crisis in asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">Expenditure per applicant per day of stay was then lower in those years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, it is not possible to maintain a high level of fulfillment of these devices in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="185">The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated demand for higher accommodation capacity should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out certain repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of the asylum facilities operated under contract allows for the adoption of operational solutions in the area of the capacities of the asylum facilities, where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">The asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Ministry has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residential centre Brezová pod Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 seats and the accommodation centre 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">An increasing number of asylum seekers were dealt with by the Ministry by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovenskej Technickej University Bratislava with a flexible available capacity of between 250 and 940 seats.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the contract concluded, the lessee also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the Ministry addressed the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Reception centres had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% in the audited period, while residential centres had an average occupancy rate of 33% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="197">The occupancy rate varied according to the season and was highest in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">A further increase in accommodation capacity of about 450 seats will be possible after the reconstruction of the centres in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">Following the completion of the centre in Humennom in 2006, the number of seats will increase by a further 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the cost of operating asylum facilities are presented in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body, which will provide premises and ensure the running of the facility, including related activities, is one of the options to ensure, at reasonable cost, the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of state funds and assets</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Economic analysis</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, in 2001, the approved budgeted expenditure of SUZ was increased by CZK 103,077,000 by 13 budget measures.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of these, 89,979,000 CZK (87.29%) were earmarked funds. Most of it was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (44,538,000 CZK) and to provide health care to asylum seekers (38,870,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, the SUZ's expenditure was increased by CZK 88,362,000 by twenty budget measures.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of these, 62,282,000 CZK (70.48%) were earmarked funds, the bulk of which (53,200,000 CZK) was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, SUZ's expenditure was increased by a total of CZK 88,078,000 by 14 budget measures.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of this, CZK 82,000 (93.09%) was earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was intended for medical care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 for dealing with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000,000 for the humanitarian evacuation programme for disabled people in the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the implementation of the SUZ's selected expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the above overview that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="214">Expenditure on purchasing services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The worsening expenditure under this heading was expenditure on accommodation and meals for applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenditure on medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing security at individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) accounted for a significant share of the total expenditure of the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, purchases of materials accounted for a significant share of SUZ's total expenditure (around 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest share of this expenditure (7.61%? 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the Ministry for the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures, which dealt with legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">In particular, in 2001 and 2002, the draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure section was characterised by an imbalance between the requirements of the Ministry, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the need to finance their legal entitlements, and the resources provided mainly in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The budget chapter manager addressed the disproportion with a number of budgetary measures during the year, increasing the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by up to 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the implementation of the selected expenditure of the Ministry during the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums in the range of 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services in the range of 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure accounted for the bulk of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% was spent on security services and between 3.92% and 7.20% was spent on food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another significant part was spending on accommodation and catering services, with a share ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">Capital expenditure accounted for a relatively low share in the range of 1.03% to 6.25%.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Deficiencies identified</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar shortcomings which did not have a major impact on the management of the state's funds and assets.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were mainly shortcomings in the following areas: (A) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the State Budget Act, when current expenditure was used to cover actions having the character of a technical evaluation of fixed tangible assets; (b) the violation of the Accounting Act in the field of inventories and the failure to comply with the indicative chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the management of state property, where it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to land registry data violated the Land Registry Act; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person entitled to waste management violated the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, in the Slovak Republic, deficiencies were found in the provision of excessively high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in the award of public contracts and in the management of the state's assets, when its records were not sufficiently secured and the method of liquidating unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No. 320 / 2001 Coll., on Financial Control, was introduced at SUZ as of 1.7. 2002, setting out the competencies of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, ongoing and follow-up checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal auditor of the SUZ was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year, the SUZ is issued with a plan of financial, social and operational technical checks, the aim of which is a comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and assets in individual asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">In 2002, 42 management checks were carried out and in 2003 54 were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the Office of the Control of the Minister ensures the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic with regard to compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="237">During the audited period, the performance of tasks in the field of asylum policy was not checked.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system of the Ministry of Finance is mainly focused on the implementation of preliminary and ongoing financial control under Act No 502 / 2001 Z. z., on financial control and vnútornom audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The exercise of financial control is also governed by the internal rules of the Director of the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="240">The substantive orientations of the control activities as part of the management of the various departments were set out in the framework of the annual plan of the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="241">The directors of the trade unions have been designated as responsible for exercising control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the written documentation submitted, no deficiencies were identified.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the entry into force of Decree No 28 of 23 April 2004 of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the Interior has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.</seg>
<seg id="244">The organisational security of this task will need to be resolved in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint Report on Parallel Controls of Expenditure on Construction of the Prague-Dresden Motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without trans-European transport networks, it would be difficult to imagine a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">High-quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating the conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of passengers and freight is an important task for the state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a very demanding task, both in organisational and technical terms and in financial terms.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts at sustainable mobility often find it difficult to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction of transport infrastructure, even with the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="9">The considered procedures and decisions of the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport works can bring significant savings in public financial resources, which can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of audit institutions is to actively look for deficiencies that have led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audit institutions should not only draw the attention of the state administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of the citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two highest audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (Germany and the Czech Republic), the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (SAO), carried out parallel checks on expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A 17 motorway in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The motorways are connected by a border bridge, which is co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to the cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough audit of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the basis of close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the amount of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction process, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, in the course of the award of the contract, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the SDD") made mistakes which led to an extension of the competition period and a reduction in the construction period.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the contract with the contractor was signed later than expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time and to ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, the SDD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint inspection work, the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways were compared on the basis of the per m2 area of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical analysis of prices has made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per square metre of area.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of more than 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to a delay in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, the auditors found that the prices of the tunnels on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and the SAO now have a database on the prices of bridges and tunnels, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the funds used for transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, both control institutions recommend: Standardization of bridge construction and use of coupled steel concrete and special structures only in cases where pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the main features of cooperation was its team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the course of the parallel inspection, the inspectors shared their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report reports on the progress and results of parallel checks on the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The controls focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel inspections were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel checks were carried out in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion, including VAT (approximately €690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million was planned to be used from European funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to a parallel audit carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A17 motorway amounted to around €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - the central and southern parts of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A17 motorway runs from the state border of the Czech Republic / Germany to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, the border sections of the two motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections became operational on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is thus completed all the way to Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D 8 motorway it is not completed, as section 0805 of 16.4 km through the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22,940 vehicles per day in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the control of the construction of the bridge was an important aspect of the parallel checks carried out by the two control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and the SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have been discussing close cooperation in the control of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">There were serious reasons for both parties to cooperate:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction is based on the SDD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out an inspection of the construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the overall level of costs of bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to ascertain the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of travel on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Agreement on the coordinated control of the D 8 / A 17 motorway was signed on 4 January 2006 by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="64">The joint working meetings between the auditors of BRH and the SAO took place over the whole of 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The meetings addressed current problems and challenges, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The continuous exchange of information was an important feature of the cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the tender procedure, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for control in the civil service differ in the way control actions are concluded in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two supreme audit institutions have drawn up their own audit conclusions on their findings during their inspections.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved by the parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In a 2000 agreement, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a date for the completion of the construction of the border bridge, as far as possible, in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two sides then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The SDD acted as an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany has a 42.13% financial stake in the construction of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the SDD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the SDD agreed to a coupled steel and concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of double pillars from seven to five and the consequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, the comparative calculations carried out by the SDD stated that the coupled steel concrete structure should be a less expensive option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was an error in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">They stated that the new jointed steel concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it's 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">In the course of awarding the contract for the border bridge, the SDD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It did not prepare contract documents that adequately described the assessment criteria and the sub-criteria for the comparison of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to a subjective and problematic evaluation of bids by the bid assessment and evaluation committee and the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful tenderer contested the results of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition led to the contract for the construction contract being signed later than originally planned.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after bids were evaluated, was wasted and construction time was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The procedure offered included the double installation of the bridge top, a change in the construction of the pillars and the installation and equipment of the assembly areas.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was not able to procure the originally designed type of steel within the necessary time.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel - at a price higher by about €4 million, which had to be paid in full by the SDD - made it possible to reduce the time for the implementation of anti-corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to reduce the total construction time of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of the construction of the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in funding.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced time allocated to construction work has led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The net cost is currently around €25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on mathematical statistical methods.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition, the tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In the preparation of this part of the inspection, it was important to identify precisely the relevant prices.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two supreme audit institutions have set the following principles for comparing the prices of bridges: Based on the actual price paid for the bridge, excluding value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and the SNR and are subject to changes); do not take into account the prices for the special foundations of the bridge; recalculate the prices in CZK to €according to the rate of the European Central Bank applicable on 30 December 2005 (CZK 29 = €1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On both D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of different structures (steel concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, coupled steel and steel) and of different sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of structure.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the size of the population allowed the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The inspections found that prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): The larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price's dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on A 17 and four on D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">In order to find these bridges, a method was used to detect atypical values in a set of numbers and a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (the distance from the regression curve upwards is decisive for determining atypical expensive bridges).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypical high price of these bridges should only be considered as an indicator of which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the reasons for the high price in each case identified should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">In view of the fact that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German bridges (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the bridge price on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction sector in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">In the course of the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the competition for the contract.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of the contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, there is more variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of construction of the bridge is decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is taken at the time when the application for a territorial decision is submitted by the SDD.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, the SDD selects types of bridges from several options, but economy plays a smaller role in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be drawn on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond the scope of this inspection.</seg>
<seg id="131">The Boundary Bridge is the most expensive combined steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, the prices of tunnels on D 8 were found to be twice as high as those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on D 8 with the tunnels in Germany did not show any significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the construction of tunnels in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not make it possible to draw generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden - Prague motorway</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved a concept for the development of the motorway network.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains should have been acquired before the border section 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic procures the D 8 motorway as part of its programme funding.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme No 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague - Ústí nad Labem - state border of the Czech Republic / Germany" set out two objectives for the construction of the D 8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">Improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem - a national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">Improve connections between Prague and Berlin in the framework of the 4th Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin-Istanbul - an international goal.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of the section running through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the completion date is not the same as the commissioning date.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section running through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official planning decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">There is no final decision on the actions.</seg>
<seg id="152">It cannot therefore be ruled out that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the documentation of the programme.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of section 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SDD carried out an estimate of the capital expenditure for the border section D 8 no. 0807 and the section no. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999-2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimated capital expenditure included in the investment costs is about €639 million for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR)</seg>
<seg id="158">All motorways and expressways under consideration are open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All motorways and expressways under consideration are open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All motorways and expressways under consideration are open, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened on the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections, net of VAT, calculated as at 31 December 2005, was €897 million, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the cost level used in the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will run on a different, more expensive route, which would affect the above-mentioned threshold of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis has shown that the construction of both sections of motorway is economically viable with a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of bypass routes for the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains projects a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the limit of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="171">There is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis, due to the higher load on the bypass routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 was expected to have will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is before inefficent.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 motorway also resulted in cost overruns similar to those of the two sections on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany estimated the cost to be around €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost-benefit ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have risen sharply to around €670 million, reducing the cost-benefit ratio by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to a parallel audit carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, the BRH found that the competent approval state authority had requested an off-road tunnel for Section A 17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the inspection, BRH was able to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">This resulted in savings of around €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">In its assessment of the first section A 17, BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the Road Administration did not carry out a survey of the conditions of the bedrock in the Dölzschen rocks, as the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was carried out only after the tunnel stamping machine hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests have shown that the rocks inside are more weathered than expected during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">As a result, costly measures such as anchoring, injection and stone-fall protection nets had to be taken, costing about €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Roads and Motorways Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as safety measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also of measures that would not have been necessary if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training of drilling personnel (€0.5 million) and rising wages and goods costs due to project overruns (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">On the basis of the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction works.</seg>
<seg id="192">In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the Road and Motorway Directorates the necessary incentive to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of the two audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and progress of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">The two supreme audit institutions have built a database on the price of bridges and tunnels, which will be used for future inspections.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway do not differ from those of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of both institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use for further inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds earmarked for the financing of projects implemented under the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="3">The developing community of European citizens is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let this community give an opening statement on this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (or 37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often a remnant of darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: Some cover maritime areas, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most of the programmes are bilateral, but some involve more than two neighbouring countries. "</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last for seven years and receive a total of €5.7 billion from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The programmes cover the following activities: Repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investment in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, employment advice, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is provided on the condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or small and medium-sized enterprises) come together to implement projects that are based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funding shall be provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characteristics: Joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and allocated to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: Joint selection of the lead partner, joint preparation of the project and the application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, taking overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, total support payments are received by the lead partner and transferred to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out on the territory of regions and provinces adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">Objectives AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (Opps ČR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">€258,187,467 has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from European funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be used up by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the implementation of EU funds from the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement on cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27 February 2013 after previous mutual discussions at the meeting of the heads of the supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to check whether the implementation of the operational programme was carried out in accordance with legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system was functioning reliably, whether the objectives of the operational programme were being achieved and whether the selected projects were being carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down for the support granted.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel check, in which the supervisory authorities independently examined, on the basis of their legal mandate, topics the content of which had been discussed jointly in advance.</seg>
<seg id="27">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit also included elements of a performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">As a result of the checks carried out, the audit findings were published in the usual way by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the basis of the two control conclusions set out in the Annex, this joint report has been produced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1) which fall under aid area 1.1 - Strengthening transport accessibility and aid area 2.2 - Promoting tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the disbursement of funds from these two support areas represented more than 60% of the funds paid to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects across Opps ČR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to the audit of a joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and NIK another two (all in the field of support 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to the ERDF beneficiaries, which were audited by the SAO and NIK, amounted to a total of €25,362,174 (SAO) and €8,450,784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited amount represented 41% of the total amount paid to beneficiaries in aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">Main CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both audits carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and the NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of significance.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of Opps ČR-POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited entities, which were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misapplication of funds and non-use of ERDF funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Evidence of the effectiveness of the projects carried out under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the objectives set, which was also supported by the results of a survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects.</seg>
<seg id="43">Summary OF THE RESULTS OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to check the management and control system of Opps ČR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: The managing authority (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development POL) and the auditors (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in relation to the setting up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to the setting of the objectives of the programme and the monitoring of progress made, evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the absorption of programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, the control activities of the managing authority, the setting up of the performance of activities and outputs from audits of the entrusted audit body and the system for reporting and monitoring irregularities and its compliance, while at the same time the coordination of tasks and cooperation between the institutions involved in Opps ČR-POL was examined.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the drawing up of control plans at the site of implementation of projects were examined and the evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The examination of the control system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot checks, which allowed for the approval of e.g. supplies of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, as well as the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant shortcomings were identified by the SAO audit in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information about the subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of project evaluation and approval, a risk of lack of transparency in this process has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Further weaknesses were found in the setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">On the basis of these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the Managing Authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities identified by the NIK, which related to the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules, were not considered significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities only had an impact on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire Opps ČR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">Evaluation of the results of projects</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and the objectives set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all the projects audited, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects described below.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect that the SAO and NIK paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of an objective evaluation of the implementation of the expected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time the objectives of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, a public opinion poll was conducted in the summer of 2013 at the site of the implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both for the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and for the Czech public in relation to the part of the project carried out in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey covered in particular the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of resources and social function of the projects, including the investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents per project is set out in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social evaluation of the projects was good, reaching 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), meaning that the results of the projects were viewed positively by the majority of respondents, both with regard to the objectives and other parameters set out in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents, the projects examined met the criteria set out in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and the renewal of contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of the responses indicated some difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives / parameters (actual level of impact) and the level expected by the respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference relates to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of participants in the panel discussions (target groups) carried out in the framework of the NIK inspection on the Polish side, who pointed out the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and the fulfilment of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of the legality of the audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">The beneficiaries were checked for compliance of the material and time implementation of the project with the schedule and content of the project application, the fulfilment of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in the projects, the handling of any project revenue, the fulfilment of the obligation to keep separate accounts of project transactions, compliance with the ban on financing projects from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, the fulfilment of mandatory publicity concerning in particular the dissemination of awareness of the sources of financing of projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of eligibility of project expenditure, the selection of contractors and the verification of the deliverables on the basis of public contracts awarded.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the shortcomings of the qualified SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found to be €85,094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the established level of materiality related to the total amount of funds audited for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the irregularities found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the commitments under the terms of the aid were duly fulfilled by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds earmarked for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">However, seven out of the eight beneficiaries audited by the NIK were found to be in breach of their material and financial obligations.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and related in particular to the inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, which did not, however, affect the choice of contractor or the supply of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of the projects audited by the NIK can an irregularity found relating to non-compliance with reporting obligations be classified as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which EUR 8 231 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, in three of the 19 projects audited, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure amounting to CZK 2,098,053 (of which €76,863 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included the failure to deliver paid materials and works, or the cost of upgrading a property owned by a person who had no connection to the project either as a beneficiary or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system, especially with regard to the consistent establishment of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, efforts should also be made to establish indicators at programme and project level that allow for more reliable verification of the implementation of the identified impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">The notes and recommendations resulting from the checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit conclusions of the SAO and NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was written in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public works procurement and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on the parallel audit carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the State is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the Single Economic Area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its legislation, the EU has set limits beyond which contracting authorities must meet certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts that are below EU limits in value, the regulation of their award remains the responsibility of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, public procurement is prone to corruption, with a consequent high potential for harm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Contracting authorities are therefore obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair advantage (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel inspections in the field of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law, as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Controls included procurement below European limits to tackle the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Areas of control and controlled institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH assessment is based on blanket inspections of the above mentioned areas, which were carried out with the German building authorities responsible for federal transport and land construction between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, the construction of motorways and large-scale building projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The BRH also included findings from past inspections.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO's assessment is based on inspections carried out between 2008 and 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the award of federal public contracts is mostly carried out by the regional building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the field of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of the state institutions for road and rail construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of civil engineering, public procurement is carried out by entities receiving budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at different stages of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation should take into account the differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are set out in the so-called federal government procurement manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail in the light of legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation relating to contracts with a value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law underwent significant changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened the way for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fundamental aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As far as European procurement procedures are concerned, open and restricted procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European threshold are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for tender, negotiated procedure), but these are practically identical to the above conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and in the event of a call for competition, any candidate may submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and dividing it into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">The award of contracts divided into these lots gives as many candidates as possible the opportunity to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction companies are registered in Germany, with 1.9 million employees.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the terms of European procedures must also be applied in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception is the simplified sub-standard procedure, where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of contracting authorities' public works contracts and share of different types of procedures in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of which CZK 1,138 billion (15%) was the share of public contracts, which, in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of federal road and land construction projects (excluding the construction of railways and waterworks) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of the federal contracts for land works and transport works was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public calls; 12.7% restricted procedures and restricted calls;</seg>
<seg id="55">6.6% of negotiated procedures and direct procurement; 33.2% is the share of European procurement.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached CZK 118.6 billion in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, it reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedures; 14.3% restricted procedures; 9.5% negotiated procedures; 8.4% simplified procedures for sub-standard contracts; 2.7% other procedures.</seg>
<seg id="59">These figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The figures show that: Parallel checks in both countries have focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption, which must always be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open significance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel checks on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The inspections focused on comparing the legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public contracts in the field of land and transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">Key findings are set out below:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national laws of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but of the two countries' national procurement rules, which differ in part in terms of focus and detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the basic requirement that tender documents must meet is to include all the information necessary for the preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, it is required to divide contracts into lots where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO's audits showed that in the Czech Republic, very large public works in the field of road construction are awarded without being divided into parts, or divided into parts, but only into very significant parts in volume. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">Such restrictions on market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk unserious price negotiations and abusive agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to award additional works if the need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for the correct identification of the type of procurement are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, according to the regulations in force, contracting entities are free to choose one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">German procurement and budget law enshrines the primacy of open procedures for both European and national tenders, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger pool of bidders to bid and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it more difficult to negotiate prices illegally between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best value for money results are being achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts whose estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting authorities have always launched a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective instrument.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a public works contract in accordance with European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish prior information and a contract notice, in order to strengthen competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited completed with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, correct application of provisions and / or a lack of controls may have affected competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">There is a greater risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should rotate candidates as often as possible, inviting them to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, the requirements to prevent risks of manipulation are in part very detailed.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information in the course of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between those interested parties and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must, as far as possible, be prevented from restricting competition by means of unlawful agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, in several cases the German contracting authorities audited did not comply with this requirement (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality of offers are designed to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of offers is regulated procedurally in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but they have not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities submitted their tenders to third parties for inspection without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The bids were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (point 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">For reasons of legal protection, tenderers are required to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not adequately supported (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The tender documentation for the audited contracting authorities in both countries was not always complete or fully credible.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always properly respected in the minutes of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some of the weaknesses identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting authorities in both countries mostly complied with their reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the guiding principles of European procurement law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts with a view to ensuring the free movement of goods and services, and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), both of which were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The EU's general procurement principles include, in particular: The requirement of a competitive environment; the requirement of equal treatment or non-discrimination; the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include The Directive on the coordination of public procurement procedures also includes provisions for construction projects with a total estimated value of €5 million or more.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: The content of the tender documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the procedure; compliance with the deadline for the receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Remedies Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of procurement law, tenderers may have the decisions of the contracting authority reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">There is no legal definition of what corruption actually means in either country.</seg>
<seg id="127">Corruption is generally understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for its own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is instigated by those who benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be a barrier to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">Total corruption-related damage is estimated to amount to 5% of global economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved in a contract, agreements restricting competition or allowing unfair conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, capacity and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">That is why preventing corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practices and procedures must be monitored, particularly in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption, so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">As a rule, the award of public works contracts is considered to be an area particularly vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption can be prosecuted under criminal and labour law, especially when it comes to active and passive bribery, receiving and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process, apart from risk analysis: The priority of open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; the separation of the planning, procurement and accounting phases; the precise and complete documentation of the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other measures to prevent corruption have become part of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology implemented a system to monitor procurement for the construction of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed to identify possible inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area have been set out by the government in the "Government's anti-corruption strategy 2011-2012," which has been updated to 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some of these measures have been incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: A reduction in the limits for small-scale contracts; an obligation for prior notification by the contracting authority, including the justification for the contract; a ban on limiting the number of tenderers in a restricted procedure and the abolition of the general possibility of limiting the number of tenderers by drawing lots; an obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; an obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of checks relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender documents</seg>
<seg id="150">The tender documents shall contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documentation must make it possible to draw up the tender price.</seg>
<seg id="152">In order to be able to do so, candidates must not be exposed to risks they could not have foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents contain, in particular, specifications, as well as requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must restrict competition to the minimum extent possible and all interested parties must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">The specification must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific products are allowed on a very limited scale in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, the documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that specifications should be given in general without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specification must specify the supplies and services required and detail the number of units of works and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be quoted according to the units of work or supplies (e.g. in CZK / m or in CZK / item).</seg>
<seg id="167">It is only permissible to define the required works in terms of their functionality in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that specifications must be drawn up in a complete and unambiguous manner.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payments in the form of lump sums or according to time worked should be avoided where possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the tender documents must exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare its tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender shall not be published until the tender documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contractors to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate lots where the nature of the subject-matter of the contract so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, it is required to apply the rule of dividing works into parts, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific aspects (specialised parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows small and medium-sized entities to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes it more difficult to fix prices.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, the tender documents must contain evaluation criteria for national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">In doing so, the tenderer should be fully and comprehensively informed of the criteria against which its tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion of any information that would help to identify the specific firms, architects or designers involved.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages through contacts with these independent experts without the knowledge of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why independent experts are not allowed to publish tender documents and allow them to be accessible for examination.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only point of contact for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, after the conclusion of the original contract, there is almost always a need for additional works or modification of existing works.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries allows the award of a contract for additional works up to a certain limit to the same contractor, without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of additional works under European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, the additional work must be necessary and must have the character of a specific component of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the award of additional works.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may entail the risk of a greater delay in the execution of the contract and the possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">If the contract for additional works is awarded to the contractor of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or additional works.</seg>
<seg id="196">The calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to additional works, there may also be minor works, i.e. works that were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, less and more work cannot be compensated for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have since been replaced by EU standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications included information requiring a particular brand name, e.g. for the resistance system of public signs, to prevent water penetration or for noise proofing, although this was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications broken down into items</seg>
<seg id="206">In not a single case of control of procurement procedures did BRH notice a disagreement with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services according to the quantity specifications broken down into lots.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, tender documents were fully prepared before the call for tenders was launched.</seg>
<seg id="209">In various cases, however, the documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the items or the timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In isolated cases, the tender documents contained works and supplies, the need for which was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of the tender documents for the demolition works contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Subdivision of the contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for not splitting deliveries into parts has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">BRH did not find any shortcomings in the criteria for the evaluation of tenders before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of the names of authorised independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many of the documents referred to the authorised experts involved.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names appeared on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the case of land construction projects, these cases were mainly found in the tender documents, where the specifications were commissioned by self-employed experts.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities stated that they did not have sufficient staff to examine the tender documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 flats, reference was made directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products, nor did it explain why it required the supply of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of the university's facilities, the tender documents contained references to specific commercial firms and specific product labels.</seg>
<seg id="226">General overview of specifications and sub-specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documents the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the notice of assessment and determined only the enclosed space in cubic metres as a unit of measurement for each building.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the tendering procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender documents for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation due to an extension of the scope of the contract and a change in the technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the construction of social buildings, the tender documents had defects that forced the creation of additional works (there was a lack of precise focus, insufficient construction technical research, no drawings).</seg>
<seg id="232">The tender documents for the construction of the large library listed the interior elements only in descriptive terms, without specifying the quality requirements for the products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of the interior fittings of the building was provided by subcontractors who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for awarding the contract</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to award the contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">An analysis of three large road structures during the construction of the road circuit showed that when they were awarded in an open procedure in parts (separately after selected buildings) it was possible to achieve savings of up to CZK 790 million from the achieved public procurement price of CZK 15,508 million.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, when six buildings were awarded as a separate part of the public contract, savings of EUR 62.5 million could be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">A saving of CZK 287.8 million, i.e. also 25%, could have been achieved with the award of 20 bridges as a separate part of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="239">During the construction of the infrastructure, the contracting authority set out in the tender documents qualification criteria that limited the participation of small suppliers in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the terms of the tender for the contractor for one construction of the motorway, the contracting authority requested, among other things, the contractor's practice of carrying out at least three road works with a financial volume of more than CZK 700 million each, completed or put into operation during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing buildings above CZK 700 million in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of another motorway construction in an open procedure included six separate works for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of works of 12 billion in the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. €2.5 billion out of €3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were implemented by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of 13.2 billion CZK, there were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting the market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Area of multiwork</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of additional works during the construction of the road circuit and did not award additional works to any of the procedures specified in the law.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of pre-approved additional works in one case was CZK 1,591.4 million excluding VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the other case CZK 4,135.8 million excluding VAT (an increase of 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The main reason for the additional work was the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">For the construction of the university's facilities, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies, the necessity of which for the completion and approval of the work was already known when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and supplies, he concluded amendments to the contract for the work with the contractor with an increase in the price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices of the additional works, determined without competition, were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same contractor.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction cost for the construction of one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is CZK 355.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre of a four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions relating to the tender documents are almost identical in both countries and are in line with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow bidders to calculate costs and prepare their bids.</seg>
<seg id="263">In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to commission additional works.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by additional rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for carrying out manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved through the publication of award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries, the requirements for specifications are mostly met.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, shortcomings have been identified which could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">At the same time, the rule in force in Germany requiring the division of large construction projects into parts seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large volume projects without awarding them in parts or dividing them into large volume parts can limit the range of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">As a result of the strict requirement for bidders' references, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded only to a small number of bidders, leaving small and medium-sized companies with no chance of competing.</seg>
<seg id="271">The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixing and other illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">Regulatory approaches differ between the two countries when it comes to awarding and paying for additional or modified works.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, the additional works may be awarded without a tendering procedure or notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, there is a stricter limit of 20%.</seg>
<seg id="275">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="277">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the additional works must be awarded following a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing the work into parts, it is possible to avoid the reduction of competition and the subsequent negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By specifying the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers that will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The procuring entity may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited or limit the scope according to the specified criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of large project works with a value that reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In particular, when choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="288">If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the European procurement procedure by launching a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below the limit of €1.0 million ($25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimate of the entire contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">It is not permissible to divide a construction project or deliberately estimate its costs too low in order to avoid a fundamental obligation to launch a European tender.</seg>
<seg id="290">The choice of the type of governance is very important for preventing corruption, as reducing competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification of the type of procedure chosen, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law, is an important part of the tender documentation.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented the EU's legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures also for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are allowed only if the conditions laid down by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech legislation, the relevant German legislation on budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public invitation to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted proceedings, are permitted only in exceptional cases where permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions shall be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference for an open procedure is intended to ensure that the restriction of competition is avoided to the maximum extent possible and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">Contracting authorities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to estimate the costs of building projects.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of construction, construction units, construction parts and partial construction works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable buildings to determine the expected costs of public works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate by the entity financing the project or on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Standardisation measures are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the basis of the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to develop a database of the usual prices of standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of a pricing system to determine the expected price of a contract is determined by a new regulation requiring the subject matter of the contract to be determined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to establish unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport works for inspection, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is designed to determine the price of a project (investment) plan and should play a comparative role in the next stages of the preparation of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of the budget and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, public tenders accounted for 59.5% of total federal building projects in the field of building construction.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, the share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that, in some cases, the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of blanket control, BRH found, based on information gathered from more than 16,000 proceedings, that limited proceedings have a clear disadvantage compared to public proceedings and public appeals, and limited proceedings also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, tender prices in restricted and negotiated procedures were between 6% and 10% higher than in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Regional Court of Audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained in public and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In fact, a study by the Ministry of Construction found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated at more than €5 million ($125 million), the audited contracting authorities generally prepared tender plans indicating which works would be awarded in the European tender procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of works awarded under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">There has been no case of circumvention of the requirement for a European procedure in the form of an excessively low estimate of costs.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases, the minimum share for pan-European management was not reached due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of carrying out the work, some contracting authorities have unlawfully changed the contract award plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not provide any justification for these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of the European procedure would subsequently be respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of European procedures according to project accounts was generally lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected values of contracts for construction projects exceeded the European limits, the contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual parts with a value exceeding €1 million ($25 million).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving any valid reasons for the need to derogate from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a major sporting event and construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the statutory regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the estimated price</seg>
<seg id="343">The price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices indicated in the completed procedures, which were, however, burdened by the inefficiencies and excessive profit of the suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price standards.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to prices from the past, but also in relation to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For land buildings, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or on an estimate by the investor.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then differed significantly from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated cost of the construction of the large library was twice as high as the contract price, but it increased by CZK 54 million, or 27%, during the construction process.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33% lower than the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased during the implementation process.</seg>
<seg id="352">For the construction of a large library, it was 400 million CZK, or 22%. For the construction of a judicial palace, the actual price during the construction process increased disproportionately (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (by only 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and respect for European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national regulations of the two countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public procedures in Germany is stricter than the European rules and the current national rules in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public call for participation gives more competitors the opportunity to participate in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids, which guarantee the best value for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened as the pool of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixing of prices between tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech law allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a ban on contracting authorities from limiting the number of bidders in restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">The restricted procedure has now come very close to an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, contracting authorities are largely satisfied with the requirement of preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects carried out in Germany, the European limits were not respected, which resulted in a minimum share not being reached in Europe-wide procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, a satisfactory system has not yet been put in place to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting authorities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met or create the conditions necessary to allow a correct calculation of the expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation of proceedings</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded under a European procedure, the contracting authority shall publish a report on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="369">Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">By means of prior notices, the contracting authority must specify the basic specifications of the intended projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">Advance notices are required for projects where the total cost estimate is equal to or greater than the European limit and where the contracting authority wishes to reduce the time limit for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority is obliged to publish a contract notice with detailed information for all public contracts that require a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information shall be binding on the contracting authority after publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">The notice shall include, inter alia, specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common procurement vocabulary must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">In the EU, preliminary information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notices at national level should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notice is sent to the EU Publications Office.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in the advance notice may distort competition or even facilitate manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and tender notices in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">The procurement procedure may not start earlier than one month after the prior notice has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of prior information may be waived only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where there is no need for a European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national proceedings, the public notice must be published on the federal government website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted procedures without competition from the parties, the notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or higher than €25,000 ($625,000).</seg>
<seg id="390">Advance notices must explain all the planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small orders in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">The division of projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Advance notice</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities published a prior notice of projects which included works to be awarded under the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they reduced the time limit, although the number of days between sending the advance notice and sending the contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other summary procedures, the annual deadlines for prior information expired and were due to be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the prior notice did not indicate the expected division of the works into several parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="401">Some notices contained codes from the Common Dictionary that deviated from the content of the advance notice or did not specify precisely the work to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="402">In isolated cases, the notice at national level included more information, e.g. on delivery dates, or was published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting authority has hired an external company to publish a national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">It published a notice on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authority did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to send a notice to a free internet government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of the notices were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="409">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="410">During the construction of the waste water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out in the notice of restricted tender for the contractor the criteria according to which it would reduce the large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority was not able to substantiate the method of selection (reduction) of tenders for evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="412">Previous legislation made it possible to reduce the number of offers.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the construction of the road circuit, the contracting authority did not define in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documents the values against which it would assess the level of compliance with the qualification criteria or the number of candidates to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification so that all six candidates in the restricted procedure fulfilled it, but excluded one of them, saying that he fulfilled it only in the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what of the qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of calls</seg>
<seg id="417">In the case of construction works in former military tours, the contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to tender in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summary</seg>
<seg id="419">A two-stage information process with prior information and the publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency requirements and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">As opposed to an open procedure, restricted procurement procedures do not allow all potential interested bidders to participate.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the contracting authority will first select potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow a cap on the number of candidates in European restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, the restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">Selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is highly susceptible to manipulation, such as the preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting authorities should replace tenderers who are invited to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">Nor is it permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities shall document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, in the case of a restricted procedure, it is required to invite at least three candidates and, in the case of a negotiated procedure, several suitable candidates.</seg>
<seg id="441">Apart from two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of candidates approached in the event of a restricted and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the "four eyes principle" must be respected in the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes a list of them, another must substantially modify the proposal, for example by removing the proposed candidate or installing another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to avoid a situation in which an individual can definitively determine the number of candidates who will take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">In the absence of such a provision, far-reaching collusion between the parties is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers to be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor is there any measure for the confidential treatment of the list of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under German provisions, candidates may not be appointed by outside companies, but may be submitted to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no such requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">Apart from a few cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of candidates was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7,000 contracts for works with a value up to the national limit showed that contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential tenderers in the case of restricted procedures and an average of 4.4 tenderers in the case of direct negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, in the area of building construction, the contracting authorities did not change the range of tenderers contacted because they had good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they should ensure that they reach out to tenderers whose suitability they have already ascertained in advance.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence of illegal regional restrictions, the pool of candidates in closed procedures included a larger proportion of regional applicants than in the case of public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="461">This was explained by the low level of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.</seg>
<seg id="462">The principle of cross-checking and proposals by self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">Contracting authorities have largely ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">In particular, they argued that there was a lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who proposed the candidate who was asked to take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="466">An examination of some samples showed that the list of potential tenderers was drawn up by self-employed professionals and was accepted unchanged by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="467">As a result, contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of the treatment of lists of potential candidates</seg>
<seg id="469">For one contracting authority, a list of candidates for invitations to tender was kept in a database to which all staff had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of the expected or accepted bidders, who could then agree on a price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">Only in a few cases did the dossier state the reasons for selecting candidates.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for selecting candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the road circuit, the interested parties did not have information about what of their qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For the action related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the tender notice for participation in the restricted procedure did not set out the criteria for limiting the number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority limited participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then selected the candidates by random selection - drawing lots, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion in the contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have put in place special measures to prevent undue restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (the four-eye principle), by keeping the list of candidates confidential and by prohibiting external companies from making proposals for the selection of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit found that part of those rules had not been applied to a sufficient extent and that an undue restriction of the pool of candidates had not been prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities are obliged to completely eliminate these deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase, in which potential tenderers can draw up bids on the basis of tender documents received, begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and / or a call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the opening of the envelopes, potential tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to apply for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not impose specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority must comply with the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and avoid potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those provisions relate, in particular, to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers draw up their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Design offices that are involved in management should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of confusion in the tender documents or if further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply information to the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices responsible for drawing up the tender documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Throughout this phase, any contact between the Design Office and the bidders must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout the process as allowing contact with them may adversely affect competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Tenders submitted electronically must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with the printing and distribution of documentation, and their employees must be bound to observe confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and handed over directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This staff member shall not have any interest in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">Bids received must be locked until the opening date of the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall draw up a report with details of the competition, including the number of the tender, and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no specific rules on the custody of offers.</seg>
<seg id="512">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">BRH checked the terms of reference of the administration building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Submission of tender documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The audited contracting authorities sent out the tender documents either directly or commissioned an external firm to print and distribute them.</seg>
<seg id="517">The self-employed did not send any documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to be provided to candidates</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the tender documents relating to the questioning and obtaining of information, the contracting authority did not follow the rule for separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">In violation of the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his contact staff in the documentation, but rather the staff of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tender notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, tenderers who raised questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of offers</seg>
<seg id="524">For the contracting authorities, all tenders received were stamped with a receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in negotiated procedures, bids were accepted by self-employed professionals, in breach of the one-stop-shop rule for preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custom of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marketed, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custodial locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in the open compartment of the mailroom, to which all staff had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed the box in the corridor without constant supervision and part of the tenders thrown into the box remained there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, making it accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, particularly between interested companies and design offices that cooperate in the procurement process, throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all candidates.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of offers.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, the collected inspection records showed breaches of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These inconsistencies can easily be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of the envelopes, the tenders which have been closed so far are opened, their contents are read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period during which a tenderer is bound by its tender shall begin at the end of the period for the submission of the envelopes or their opening and shall end at a date specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect both bids and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of "multiple eyes," transparency and credibility of the opening process are intended to prevent manipulation and modification of offers already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">The opening of the envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">Compliance with the principle of "multiple eyes" is intended to prevent individuals from covertly manipulating offers.</seg>
<seg id="552">Candidates may be present when the envelopes are opened.</seg>
<seg id="553">When opening, all envelopes must be placed in front of the chairman of the commission and are opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Late tenders may not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency in the opening of envelopes, this stage, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing, including the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">A commission is being set up in the Czech Republic to open the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts shall be permitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">The members of the committee may also be entrusted with the discussion at subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. the evaluation of the bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of building, the registrar may not be involved in the preparatory phase (preparation of the tender documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and may not be a member in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require that the minutes of the opening of the envelopes contain not only the offer prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, such as damaged envelopes when they are received or offers received late.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, in addition to the bid prices, the entry must also include an indication of the language of the bid and the signature mandate of the bidder.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require all parts of opened envelopes to be marked in order to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked with a date perforation, must be kept confidential (secret) at the end of the opening of the envelopes and may only be made available to those who process them further.</seg>
<seg id="569">Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope may not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.</seg>
<seg id="571">They do not have this arrangement in Germany, and if a single offer is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Principle of cross-checking</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities followed the four-eye principle.</seg>
<seg id="576">The manager and the registrar, who was not assigned another role, were always present.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in rare cases, in small negotiated procedures, individuals have opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Process of opening envelopes</seg>
<seg id="579">The opening notes did not always document the progress.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, late bids were not marked and in some cases signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Indication of offers received</seg>
<seg id="582">Contracting authorities marked tenders with a date perforation, which was in line with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Some of them have mislabelled offers in the past, but changed their practice after BRH's warning.</seg>

<seg id="586">Deadline for receipt of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">During road repairs, for one event, the tender was submitted to the contracting authority with a delay of one month, which accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">The essential parts of the opening provisions in both countries are identical with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, thus allowing the risk of corruption and manipulation to be substantially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, in particular the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">The marking, safe keeping and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes to the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, the staff responsible for opening the envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">Despite the detection of some irregularities, the findings confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within a specified period.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating bids in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to check the suitability of the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must be in a good economic and financial position and have the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from the procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Bids from non-excluded bidders must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically advantageous tender and, in particular, examine all significantly low price tenders.</seg>
<seg id="604">The review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, bidders may be eliminated without a valid reason, or bids that do not meet the requirements may be kept in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The result of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference or disadvantage of a tenderer, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in the selection of the persons involved in the process and ensure that they meet the requirements of integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They also need to make sure that the process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require bids to be reviewed and evaluated in successive stages.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for supporting candidates "suitability, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or in the tender documents shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria for assessing candidates "suitability can no longer be applied.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view, whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements that could encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">Where the evaluation of the tenders results in the discovery of an excessively low tender price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before any rejection of its tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, bidders are required to observe confidentiality and only authorised persons can take part in the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="621">The mathematical accuracy of tenders may be reviewed only by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not involved in the decision-making phase of the selection of the contractor or in the implementation phase of the project may be entrusted with the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">When external companies are entrusted with the examination and evaluation of bids, they must be aware that bids are confidential and honestly respect this fact.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only submit proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a committee appointed by the contracting authority, which will prepare a report with a proposal for the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If, in Germany, the documents and declarations required for the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must then submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their bids must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If a candidate fails to prove it, he or she must be expelled.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, it is necessary to examine not only the total price, but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the bid indicates that prices for parts of the overall project were estimated to be disproportionately high or low, bidders must be asked to explain.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide an explanation, and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is intended to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to the different parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of the individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Valuation offsets are not a reason to exclude a bid.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers an excessively high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, tenderers must prove that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, they should be excluded by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, a tender can be cancelled after a price review if only bids with disproportionately low prices were received and the bidders did not justify these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this does not justify a refusal to award the contract to the tenderer in question (unlike German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this immediately to the competent superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It must decide on the way forward and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">They must also approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract was not awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is being negotiated or whether the tender will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">The Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Verification of suitability and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some recommendations made by self-employed potential contractors, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some procurement cases, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether all published evaluation criteria were taken into account by the contracting authority in the selection process or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities have used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be performed exclusively by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">Contracting authorities have tried to justify this by their lack of human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review offers of services from people who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and to carry out with due care the fulfilment of their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As far as contracting authorities are concerned, there was generally no conclusive evidence as to whether tenders in the custody of self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and Mathematical Control of Tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities have handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed tender examination and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these verifications.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention of manipulation, third parties could make changes to the tenders which could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">The examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately labelled or where data on prices and products were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One out of 20 tenders was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of bids or negotiations with bidders for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there was also a lack of detailed information on, for example, the unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as reasons for the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contracting authorities argued that it was difficult to identify and prove countervailing prices.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the circle of normal contracting entities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">No data were recorded on the closer examination of costs or on the identification of the reasons for deviations.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority did not find any indication of price dumping for the tenderer to whom the contract might have been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clear whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">The contracting authority later rated the tenderer as a "low cost company" which was not able to meet either the quality requirements or the deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the tendering procedure and put forward the unfounded argument that the tenderer could be presumed not to have based its pricing on disproportionately high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">One contracting authority was found to have two cases of irregularities, which were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing identical price calculations, which prompted the contracting authorities to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The checks did not show any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction projects, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the contracting authority's requirements set out in the terms of reference, or did not provide the required qualification, or, conversely, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of a candidate who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the individual evaluation criteria of the tender for the contractor were established, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For the railway infrastructure development action, the weighting of the evaluation criteria was not set at the start of the procedure when the contract was awarded, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of a road repair project, the assessment of the criterion "shortening of construction time" was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For the second and third place bidders, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater reduction in the construction time than indicated in their bids.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for selecting a candidate</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three actions related to housing promotion, the contracting authority did not provide evidence on the basis of which criteria it assessed the tenders received and how it selected the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">Accuracy of the selection of suppliers of small scale contracts related to the construction of a road circuit with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="694">It was not possible to verify CZK, as suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations about the price and the date of performance, but documents about these negotiations were not prepared.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of offers are in line with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the choice of individuals involved in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, unlike the Czech Republic, these steps in the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross principle and the protection of bids.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, it was found in some cases that the essential steps of the process in the verification and evaluation of tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The lack of control tools and transparency in the decision-making process during the review and evaluation of bids allows manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">Inspections have shown serious deficiencies, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate verification and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against the increased possibility of manipulation shall be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In all cases, the German contracting authorities audited did not use the full set of available tools to check the validity of prices and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, shortcomings were found in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the offers and the use of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After examination and evaluation of the tenders, the procurement process is completed by the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision to award the contract.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review if appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The time limit of 10 days applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the decision of the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and upholds the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by swiftly implementing procurement decisions.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority shall document the progress of the procedure in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented management information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly conducted examination and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within a specified period.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is due to the fact that the tenderer is not bound by its tender after the expiry of this period.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful tenderers should be informed of the result in good time, stating the reason why their bid was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">The cancellation of a procurement procedure is only allowed if certain conditions are met, for example if the prices in the tenders do not meet the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting time before the conclusion of a contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of a contract before a decision on its EU provisions and review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure must be cancelled if only one tender was received or if only one tender met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions set out in the tender documents and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The checks found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some European cases, proxy companies have received letters before the notification deadline, which can invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also in several cases of open procedures, the letters of authorisation contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the deadlines for awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the tenderer offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">In one case, during the reconstruction and construction of the university, the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor for the work in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the selected tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some road repair and maintenance operations, the construction of a motorway and a road ring road, contracts were concluded later than stipulated by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the case of construction works in former military tours, the contracting authority sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers only after the legal deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates helps to reduce corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes an institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding the contract was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting authorities should eliminate such deficiencies in the conclusion of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notification, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its different stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be made public.</seg>
<seg id="754">Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the fundamental requirement of the principle of transparency, which applies at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation of decision-making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">Adequate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed reasons for individual decisions and their merits significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In European procurement cases, the contracting authority must notify the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Authority publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU, which also meets the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the essential information on its procurement procedures and communicate it to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics which provide an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for European statistics are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those that are mandatory under European law, applies only to limited procedures exceeding the limit of €25,000 ($625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 ($375,000), including VAT.</seg>
<seg id="771">Only interested parties shall be informed below this limit.</seg>
<seg id="772">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of entries have not been fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notification did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for the supply specifications and national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain the mandatory requirements.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases some of the required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of the contract award</seg>
<seg id="780">In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of several awards, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="782">Obligation to notify</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistically proven files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Preliminary transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the contracting authority has published information on the outcome of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one contracting authority, information about the contract was not published due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the sponsor six months to notice the error.</seg>
<seg id="788">As a result, the outcome of the proceedings was not made public during that period.</seg>
<seg id="789">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant deficiencies were found in the tender documentation, such as incorrect tender price data in the minutes of the evaluation committee meeting.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some of the opening documents were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of the contract award</seg>
<seg id="794">In preparation for repairs and maintenance of roads, construction of the motorway and the road circuit, the contract award notices were sent after the deadline or were not published.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations cover European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.</seg>
<seg id="798">The Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to the German ones.</seg>
<seg id="799">The checks revealed shortcomings that significantly reduced the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="800">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to enhance the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary assessment and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU with a view to creating a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures to prevent corruption are not only aimed at avoiding or at least reducing corruption, but also at preventing financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of the two countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of the common and different elements that can help both countries in the further development and application of this law.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries, there is thus an important common basis for public procurement and the fulfilment of the basic requirements in the area of: Competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting authorities reinforce these requirements in part through very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has extended the provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures to procedures that are below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, inspections have shown that contracting authorities do not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate these irregularities, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, checks have identified risks affecting economy and value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">These include, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the contract, which resulted in additional works, which were often awarded in breach of the law, the lack of definition of the expected price, and the required qualifications, which narrowed the potential pool of bidders and thus reduced competition, especially in the field of transport works.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The joint checks were not intended to detect cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">When it comes to preventing corruption, the two countries have focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German provisions provide for broad and unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as a central element in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">In particular, the Czech regulations aim at strengthening the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles for preventing corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been incorporated into public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes with great precision, how to meet the requirements for preventing corruption during the procurement procedure and for selecting the persons involved in it.</seg>
<seg id="827">In BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate instrument to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, tender documentation and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions have to comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The discrepancies found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting authorities should provide further training to their staff, familiarising them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the weaknesses identified relate to activities delegated by the building administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the lack of adequate controls on the delegation of powers increases the risk of misuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore be transferred to third parties only if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">Anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level in the Czech Republic, which also have a significant impact on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO's audit activities took place during a period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely a significant change in the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The strategy adopted and the new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">For example, under the new regulations, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the estimated value of the public contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualifications, the establishment of basic evaluation criteria and the way tenders are evaluated, and properly document and publish everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both the SAO and the BRH have a favourable opinion of the ways in which the EU requirements are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their wide application in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency provide an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential for material and intangible damage resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to the practice in Germany, it appeared that the share of open tender procedures in the Czech Republic, which give room to competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour, should increase.</seg>
<seg id="848">The award of contracts in parts can also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where it is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. A higher number of bidders puts pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The organisation of the procurement procedure also has an impact on the conduct of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport structures, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where it is appropriate, and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">In addition, they believe that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for ensuring that public contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel checks on the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint Final Report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>

<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The present joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the highest audit institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the performance of parallel audits focused on the administration of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel checks was chosen on the basis of the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax administration system is set up and how the systems in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are different.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of the control actions carried out were the exchange of experience, identification of differences and identification of good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, it was beneficial to note that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise administration is very limited without parallel controls.</seg>

<seg id="18">On the results of parallel inspections of the SPD administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The regulation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been found between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and certain other oils contribute to the effective administration of excise duties; in the Slovak Republic, the distribution of control stamps is easier than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against evasion of excise duties, the supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the institute of fuel distributors and the registration of sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol have proven to be good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Revenues from excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's goals of reducing taxes on labour, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, not least because indexation of excise duty rates is not introduced in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the importance of excise duties on overall tax revenue and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, reducing the tax burden on consumption taxes in real terms.</seg>
<seg id="26">The introduction of environmental measures has long been financially supported by the state, but these measures have a negative impact on revenues from excise duties, which in the future will have to be replaced by other revenues or a reduction in state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenses incurred in administering excise duties in both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have been increasing over the long term, mainly due to wage increases, and their efficiency is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on the computerisation of the administration of excise duties (IT expenditure) and expenditure on the salaries of employees performing permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computerisation of excise administration in the Slovak Republic has not had a significant impact on the reduction in the number of tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that the Slovak Ministry reassess the validity of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditure was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period that would have led to a reduction in the personnel requirements of the excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrations was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the different years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax authorities in the Slovak Republic carry out administrative tasks mainly in the form of the physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax authorities in the Czech Republic place emphasis on remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and more expensive due to the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities.</seg>
<seg id="35">The computerisation of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the administration of tax returns for excise duties is fully computerised; in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronisation support the effective management of excise duties, which is why the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that they be applied not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure for EMCS deployment could not be compared, as the SR DG provided data on expenditure only for system upgrades in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was also incurred before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">The expenditure incurred in that period only for the upgrade of EMCS in the Slovak Republic was about 20% higher than the expenditure incurred in the Czech Republic both for the introduction of EMCS and for the upgrade of this system in more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparable expenses.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the Slovak Republic the management of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of the electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duty (EMCS) has made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but to a lower extent in the Slovak Republic, as significantly higher expenditure has been spent on the introduction and modernisation of the system than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation between the two audit institutions took place on the basis of the Cooperation Treaty on the implementation of parallel controls aimed at the administration of excise duties of 18.8.2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic have agreed to carry out parallel checks, which will primarily focus on the issue of the administration of excise duties and whose results will allow analysis, comparison and evaluation of the established facts.</seg>
<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which the parallel controls were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the subject matter and objective of the parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the parallel checks was to compare the performance of the excise administrations, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the excise administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit questions were to be answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did the excise tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of quality indicators when spending comparable expenses?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has the introduction of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient and has the cost of implementing it been spent effectively?</seg>
<seg id="52">The parallel checks carried out were intended to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, especially in the area of regulation and in the setting up of the organisational structure.</seg>
<seg id="53">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The Directorate-General for Customs (GŘC) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (SR) have joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries, the objectives of this declaration include, among other things, the fight against fraud, exploring the possibility of harmonising legislation and seeking harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, exploring the possibility of joint activities to increase efficiency in the detection of fraud and sharing experiences and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 EMCS is operated under Decision No 1152 / 2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of the audit carried out by the Czech SAO</seg>
<seg id="57">Control number: 15 / 33</seg>
<seg id="58">Subject of inspection: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="59">Objective of the audit: The aim of the audit of the SAO of the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties, in particular when monitoring transport in the system of conditional exemption from excise duties and when securing the tax (customs debts); to check whether the system of administration of excise duties is set up in such a way as to ensure the efficiency of the collection of revenue from the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="60">Audited period: 2012-2015 and, in the case of factual context, the period before and after</seg>
<seg id="61">Person audited: Directorate General of Customs</seg>

<seg id="63">Control number: KA-023 / 2016 / 1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Subject of inspection: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="65">Objective of the inspection: The aim of the inspection was an independent and objective examination of whether the SR CCP and the Customs Offices (Customs Offices) operate economically, efficiently and effectively in the administration of excise duties in accordance with generally binding legislation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Audited period: 2012-2015</seg>
<seg id="67">Audited person: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="69">Legislation on the administration of excise duties is divided into the level of EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008 / 118 / EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92 / 12 / EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the administration of taxes and the handling of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive allows taxes on consumption to be imposed on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">In particular, EU legislation regulates the minimum conditions for: The level of tax rates for the different types of products selected, the production, storage, processing and holding of taxable products, chargeability, exemptions and refunds, supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation allows control procedures and institutes to be set up at national level, provided they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, the legislation on excise duties is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353 / 2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of the tax on mineral oils, the tax on alcohol, the tax on tobacco products, the tax on beer, the tax on wine and intermediate products and the tax on raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="77">This law defines the forms of treatment of products subject to excise duties, the taxpayer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for the transport of products, the declaration of tax and penalties for infringements.</seg>
<seg id="78">The law and subsequent decrees also regulate certain other conditions for the handling of mineral oils (labelling of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and the storage of raw tobacco for purposes other than the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in sections 45 to 47 of Act No. 261 / 2007 Coll., on the stabilization of public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are also contained in special legislation. The Fuel Act No. 311 / 2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulate the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and the keeping of records of fuel put into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No 61 / 1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No 307 / 2013 Coll., on mandatory labelling of ethyl alcohol, and the relevant implementing regulations provide for mandatory labelling of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for the handling of control tapes and conditions for the handling of ethyl alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, taking over, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">The procedures for tax proceedings, which are not specified in special regulations, are regulated by Act No 280 / 2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Penalties are imposed in accordance with the procedures laid down in Act No 500 / 2004 Coll., the Administrative Code.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for the issue of a trade licence (concession) for the operation of the trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, preparation and sale of fermentation alcohol, drinking alcohol and spirits" are regulated by Act No 455 / 1991 Coll., on Trade Licensing (Trade Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has used the power to introduce control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to monitor compliance with the legislation in the handling of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as in the handling of selected products for which tax has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These include monitoring the handling of specific mineral oils and raw tobacco, the labelling of certain other mineral oils, the labelling of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic has used the right to apply excise duty to other products and has introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of changes in legislation for different types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">On the basis of the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 No 735, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market in spirits," major legislative changes were made in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, introducing a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were also major changes in the legislation on the tax on mineral oils, the tax on tobacco products and the criminalisation of the preparation of tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Protection of tax revenue through criminal law</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminalisation of the preparation of the crime "tax reduction, fee reduction and similar compulsory payment" is introduced. The modification made should allow police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. the use of operational means of search.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions of the excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="95">With effect from 1 January 2015, the issue of a permit for the handling of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Duty Act is subject to: Reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; the right to operate a business allowing the exercise of an activity related to the permit; a situation in which the applicant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of the creation of tax arrears by reducing entities authorised to handle products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability now allows the tax authorities to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both in the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent those who do not have sufficient financial income to properly comply with their tax obligations from handling selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">To assess the economic stability of the proposer, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, it also depends on the administrative discretion of the tax authorities with regard to the individual conditions of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law provides for a frequency of verification of compliance with the condition of economic stability due to the topicality of the data - the verification takes place once a year following the deadline for submitting income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax authority also has the option of laying down other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the permit holder does not comply with the conditions, the tax authority is entitled to revoke the permit or to revoke it with a delay.</seg>
<seg id="104">Out of a total of 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of incurring arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of security of the tax (e.g. repeat beneficiary).</seg>
<seg id="105">The permit was revoked for ten entities, the other applicants increased the security of the tax, capitalized their contribution to the company or provided up-to-date accounting data, according to which they already fulfilled all the conditions for the permit.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the applicant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must also be met by a natural person who is a statutory body or a member of it, or by a natural person who, although not a statutory body of the applicant or a member of it, carries out this activity (chain of legal persons in the capacity of a statutory body or its member, so-called linked entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 connected entities had been examined.</seg>
<seg id="108">The records kept under the Excise Tax Act (Sections 37 to 40 and 60 of Act No 353 / 2003 Coll.) contain information on:</seg>
<seg id="109">The type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, taken over, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment (conditional exemption scheme, import, re-entry into conditional exemption scheme, export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>

<seg id="115">In the case of records kept electronically, the records must be kept or allow output in xls, xlsx, ods format.</seg>
<seg id="116">Alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures aimed at ensuring a detailed overview of the activities of the operators (see Annex 3, Schedule A), from the production of raw alcohol to the marking with a control tape to its distribution to the final seller or authorised user of the exempt alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, the production facility for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation, is also subject to supervision by customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the handling of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are: Records of the production, receipt, stocks and dispensing of alcohol contain information on the quantity of alcohol according to the stages of production and processing of alcohol, including document numbers.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limit the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and limit the number of packages with broken control tape at the point of final sale or issue to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other container with a capacity of up to one litre and three litres, respectively, if it is a container made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Spirits in larger packages shall be regarded as unmarked and shall not be disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of final sale to a natural person for his or her personal consumption, there may be a maximum of one consumer package with a broken control tape, or three if it is fitted with a one-way valve.</seg>
<seg id="125">Compulsory registration of a person who puts alcohol in consumer packaging products with at least 15% alcohol by volume into free circulation for tax purposes and is: An importer of alcohol, a producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or an operator of a tax warehouse under a conditional exemption regime, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="126">Personal conditions - reliability, integrity and failure to declare a disqualification - must be met by the applicant and a person in the position of a statutory body or a responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="127">The applicant must provide bail of 100,000 CZK to 5,000,000 CZK (i.e. approximately 3,700 €to 185,000 €), depending on the number of control tapes taken.</seg>
<seg id="128">The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place for the marking of alcohol and the equipment of a marking point or tax warehouse with a camera tracking device with continuous operation and remote access by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="129">The registration markings of the control tape are introduced for the labelling of spirits with a capacity of more than 0.06 litres.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the case of the transport of control tapes, the registration of the control tapes shall be indicated in the transport documents or the export declaration.</seg>
<seg id="131">Until 30 November 2013, the control tape contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration sampling number, an application code for the allocation of control tapes and a classification code according to the level of ethanol concentration by volume.</seg>
<seg id="132">As of 1 December 2013, the control tape now contains two types of identifiers and the quantity of alcohol in the immediate packaging expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 ° C, rounded down to whole millilitres.</seg>
<seg id="133">The register of control tapes for the marking of spirit drinks contains daily records of the various ways in which the control tapes are handled according to the registration codes, as well as the documents on the basis of which the registration took place.</seg>
<seg id="134">When specific control tapes are destroyed, lost or stolen, the holder is obliged to electronically notify the tax authorities of the registration code of the control tapes in question and their number on the following working day after the decisive event.</seg>
<seg id="135">Introducing a new offence and adjusting the level of penalties imposed for infringements in the handling of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="136">Penalties may be imposed up to or up to ten times the amount of excise duty (e.g. destruction or loss of control tapes in excess of 0.1% of the total quantity of individual control tape orders made, failure to return the control tape within the statutory time limit).</seg>
<seg id="137">Restricting the handling of control tapes only to registered holders, who may not pass them on to another person, with the exception of providing them to a foreign supplier for the purpose of labelling spirits in consumer packaging produced outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">The exported control tapes must be placed on the consumer packaging and re-imported no later than nine months after receipt from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of the distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging, provided that similar personal conditions are met as for the person required to mark alcohol and with the obligation to post bail of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €185,000).</seg>
<seg id="140">Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of ethyl alcohol in immediate packaging.</seg>
<seg id="141">Authorised persons are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or to final sellers, or to sell it as a final seller.</seg>
<seg id="142">They may acquire ethyl alcohol from other registered persons, the insolvency practitioner, the administrative authority, organisational units of the state or unregistered persons in the execution of tax execution.</seg>
<seg id="143">Notification of the release for free circulation of ethyl alcohol or sale in consumer packaging is required to be sent by holders and distributors of ethyl alcohol to the tax authority immediately the following day after the decisive event, through an information system maintained by the tax authority (ORO web client) or in accordance with the content in xml format.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification shall include the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of ethyl alcohol, the European Goods Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or the final seller, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.</seg>
<seg id="145">Tax entities sent about 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">A compulsory concession (a specific form of business licence) not only for the production and preparation of ethyl alcohol, but also for the sale of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or professional natural person for his own internal use.</seg>
<seg id="147">Licensed trades can only be carried out after a decision has been taken by the Trade Licensing Office, subject to professional competence and other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="148">No required professional competence is required for the sale of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="149">The tax authorities benefit from an overview of sellers and their establishments and restrictions</seg>
<seg id="150">Trading on reliable entities.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the Czech Republic, about 94,000 licences were registered in 2014 and about 104,000 in 2015 for a field including the production, treatment of fermentation alcohol, drinking alcohol, spirits and other alcoholic beverages and sales.</seg>
<seg id="152">Checks on compliance with legislation on the handling of products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic are also carried out in their activities outside the tax administration: Trade offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the authorities of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the authorities of the Czech Trade Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="153">If it finds that there has been a breach of the obligation or a breach of the prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise authorities.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has put in place a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Schedule B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty, but also selected mineral oils not subject to excise duty, which have been misused for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil to the storage, transport, marking and colouring of selected mineral oils, the marking of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, the consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">Customs supervision also includes the production and handling of markers for the marking and handling of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="158">Mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (other kerosene), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not elsewhere specified) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 shall be subject to the labelling and colouring of selected mineral oils, unless their labelling is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">For example, benzole, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than motor propulsion are subject to the labelling of certain other mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is only possible to mark and colour selected mineral oils and certain other mineral oils with a marker on the basis of the permission of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="162">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils, which are a group of mineral oils falling within Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), the kinematic viscosity of which at 40 ° C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: The flash point is less than 150 ° C, the distillation test distils at least 20 per cent by volume, including losses up to 350 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils have been misused as an admixture to finished fuels, in particular diesel, or have been directly used or sold to power engines, as the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Operators handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packs of more than 220 litres must register with the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="167">The personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be fulfilled for the issue of the registration, which applies throughout the period 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.</seg>
<seg id="168">No 2658 / 87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="169">4 For example, when mineral oil is used as a fuel (except when sailing on water, unless it is a private pleasure craft) or as a component for the production of fuel, if the marking is defective in its use.</seg>
<seg id="170">Registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">As of 30 November 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, four registrations were cancelled at the request of the marketing authorisation holder.</seg>
<seg id="172">The electronic register shall contain detailed information on the receipt, actual consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil, including document numbers, purchase notification numbers to the tax authority, places of storage and consumption, the purpose of consumption, the place of storage and consumption or, at the time of sale, the place of supply and the customer registration number.</seg>
<seg id="173">Notification of any acquisition of a specific mineral oil must be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours before receipt.</seg>
<seg id="174">The identification of the trading partners, the name and nomenclature of the specific mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of consumption or information on the sale or transfer shall be notified.</seg>
<seg id="175">Notification of the expected quantity of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed in the relevant year shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notifications of the purpose of use and labelling, the place of storage or consumption, the identification details of the person to whom the specific mineral oil is resold or transferred shall be transmitted before each change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications shall be made electronically via smart forms or via a PDFA data container.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, 630 notifications were made by people handling special mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="179">The seizure and confiscation of special mineral oils or means of transport must be declared by the tax authority in cases where it finds that special mineral oils are being handled without registration or where the registered person fails to comply with his obligation to notify.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of non-compliance with obligations in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied retrospectively.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of a fuel distributor is compulsory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Only persons who meet the following criteria may be registered fuel distributors:</seg>
<seg id="183">Compulsory licence of the Trade Licensing Office (a specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The opinion on the concession application and, where appropriate, on the appointment of a responsible representative shall be given by the customs office, which shall examine whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the statutory body of the applicant - a legal person and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">If these persons meet the condition of reliability, the customs office will issue a favourable opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person is a person of impeccable character, from the point of view of criminal property, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">The award of the concession is subject to professional competence.</seg>
<seg id="188">The indebtedness of the same class of persons as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">A debt-free person is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will meet his payment obligations to the state in a proper and timely manner, i.e. he does not have arrears to the state budget and on general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">A fuel distributor may not be prohibited by a court or administrative authority from carrying out his activities.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fuel distributor must not be wound up or bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="192">Deposit of a deposit (or bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. approx. €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e. approx. €370,000) after three years of registration of the fuel distributor and fulfilment of other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="193">The distributor is obliged to notify the customs office of the distribution of fuel within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">The electronic notification shall include details of the individual purchase and sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="195">The reported data are data on business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="196">The right to reimbursement of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">A refund of excise duty on mineral oils can only be claimed in respect of an activity which is clearly linked to an activity carried out on land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were about 64,000 claims for tax refunds totalling 1,172,844,680 CZK (i.e. 43,401,720 €).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced refunds of excise duty on fuel to livestock farmers.</seg>
<seg id="200">This entitlement will now be available to farmers or breeders who, for example, are involved in the rearing of cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term under-achievement of budgeted revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate in the event of a change in the tax rate with effect from 1 December 2014.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco label means placing it on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Duty Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">The decisive factor for the application of the rate of excise duty is the manufacture of the tobacco product in the state intended for the final consumer, which does not have to be removed from storage, delivered, dispatched or sold, or sold to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet characterising the rate of excise duty appears on the tobacco label together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, and the label indicates the number of items in the package or the quantity of smoking tobacco in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">The tobacco label has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of ready-to-eat cigarettes labelled with the previous (old) rate of duty has been fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month following the entry into force of the new rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="210">The development of tobacco sticker collection in 2014 and the comparison with previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly frontloaded tobacco products with the "old" tax rate each year, effectively shifting the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Tax on raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the production of tobacco products without the authorisation of the tax authority and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco have been introduced as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">With effect from 1.7.2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, which has been delivered to another Member State or a third country, or for which the origin, purpose of use or person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved, shall be subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, marking of unit packs with control tape and restrictions on sales at designated locations have been complemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">Production facilities for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or processed.</seg>
<seg id="218">A registered person can only be a person who meets the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative, which applies throughout the registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions for registration are: (A) the right to operate a business allowing the activity of a person storing raw tobacco to be carried out, (b) reliability, (c) indebtedness, (d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been banned from carrying out his activity, (e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the granting of a bond of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. approximately €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="220">The electronic register shall contain the date of receipt or delivery of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the business partner, an indication of the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours before it is received or dispatched.</seg>
<seg id="222">The details of the business partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the address of storage, the purpose of use and the carrier shall be notified.</seg>
<seg id="223">The notification of the expected quantity of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the relevant year shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications shall be made electronically via a data container in PDFA format.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the required particulars.</seg>
<seg id="226">Legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating the area of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">The various types of excise duties are exhaustively determined by the legislation of the Slovak Republic, which is similar to the legislation of the surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="230">The legislation on excise duties is ensured by four laws according to the individual subject of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="231">The harmonisation was achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No 98 / 2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106 / 2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530 / 2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609 / 2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All laws on excise duties are regulations of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No 563 / 2009 Z. z., on Tax Administration (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, the rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework has transposed the various provisions of Council Directive 2008 / 118 / EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, as well as those of other European Community directives and legislation.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of changes in legislation for different types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, the legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In EMCS, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duties under the conditional exemption scheme has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system, where these services are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">The EMCS e-system introduced in 2015 the concept of suspension of access to EMCS for tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="239">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the option of suspending access precisely because of a well-founded fear that the tax from previous tax years will not be due or determined and that it will not be enforceable.</seg>
<seg id="241">This applies to the payment of the tax, as the transport of excise goods requires the deposit of a security, which is released by the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">The designated gas oil, also commonly known as red diesel, was a mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific statutory purposes, for example in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of the abolition of red diesel was to reduce the public deficit, to simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and to reduce the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel vendor.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce an obligation to keep records for all service stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The clarification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely the fuel distributor and the fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This amendment helped to eliminate tax evasion on petrol and diesel and clarified the movement of these fuels (see Annex 4, Schedule A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">In SR, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to be labelled with an indicator substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Materials Act has been extended and a new tax entity - the trader of tobacco raw material - has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">The tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition, an obligation to register technological installations for the production of tobacco products has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packages of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">Cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco are marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the purchaser of the control stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of the control stamps electronically, through the information system for the collection of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="262">In doing so, electronic communication between the taxpayer and the tax authority was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state printer of control stamps has been set up - in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of control stamps has also been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new stamp printing system strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, which can be used to easily verify whether goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">A unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th to 12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.</seg>
<seg id="268">In addition, the price of cigarettes, the indication of the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in the consumer pack and the length of the cigarettes must appear on the control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three substantive laws were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxing alcoholic beverages, addressing their production, monitoring movement, ensuring the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, to streamline the administration of the tax, to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of addressing the issue of the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages has introduced the application of a uniform rate of excise duty on alcoholic beverages and has taken into account the percentage by volume of actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">For non-sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the final product shall be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage by volume of the actual alcohol content of the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is an exemption from excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household up to a maximum of 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the purchaser of the control stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of the control stamps electronically, through the information system for the collection of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="278">In doing so, electronic communication between the taxpayer and the tax authority was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state printer of control stamps has been set up - in the Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of fiscal supervision over the printing of control stamps has also been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Schedule B) and the elimination of the falsification of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new stamp printing system strengthens the system for checking goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, which can be used to easily verify whether goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">A unique 12-digit identification number (1st to 2nd place is the checksum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th to 8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th to 12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law No. 353 / 2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">The tax on solid fuels, the tax on natural gas and certain other gases and the tax on electricity are part of Act No 261 / 2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, each excise duty is regulated by a special law, apart from the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duties on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, from 1 January 2015, the issue of a permit for the handling of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is subject, among other things, to proof of the economic stability of the applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the Slovak Republic, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce the security of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="292">FR SR carries out tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Finance Directorate over the handling of control stamps for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printing works and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is carried out by the state-owned company Mincovna Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not supervised by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="295">The tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken over from the printer by the designated territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">The tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at the local authority, and the alcohol control tapes are then distributed to the various local tax authorities according to the location of the markings.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or part of it, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco stickers are collected from the authorised customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, the control mark does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced during the audited period in the case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, the so-called green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is no such support for farmers in the Slovak Republic (it existed until 31 December 2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of CZK 20 million (i.e. €740,000) was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1 717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">A similar institute of fuel distributors is in place in the Slovak Republic, but without the deposit required to secure excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">In the Slovak Republic, 303 distributors were registered in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the Slovak Republic, the institute of fuel sellers and fuel consumers is established, which is licensed by the local customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labelling; in the Slovak Republic, after the abolition of the so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the control tape for the marking of alcohol contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirituality of the spirit drink, according to which a record of the control tapes is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be entered in the register on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The holder of the tape is obliged to notify their use within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In SR, a control mark intended to mark ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax authorities and is used to verify the authenticity of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register shall contain the number of stamps collected, used and returned.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of alcohol distributors.</seg>
<seg id="317">In the Slovak Republic, registration is conditional on the fulfilment of conditions relating, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol of at least €100,000 or a paid-up capital of at least €100,000; a minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is conditional, among other things, on the deposit of a bond of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax authority for the entire period of validity of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In the Slovak Republic, the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging requires the permanent presence of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of the person required to mark the ethyl alcohol, with the condition that a deposit be made in favour of the tax authority, ranging from 100,000 CZK (i.e. 3,700 €) up to 5,000,000 CZK (i.e. 185,000 €), depending on the number of control tapes taken and the installation of a tracking device with continuous access by the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic goes far beyond the EU's minimum requirements for the subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as those identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">The legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrations to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as part of the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves), an excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw material has been introduced in addition to EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not harmonised tobacco products, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movements.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic can recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability of applicants for permits under the Excise Tax Act has proved successful because it reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend that such checks also be applied in the conditions of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with the costs related to transport between the printer and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The financial administration of the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the existence and location of technological facilities for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, it is more efficient to collect the tax on tobacco products, because the order of the tobacco sticker itself is a tax return followed by the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">Thanks to the introduction of the institutes "fuel sellers" and "fuel consumers," the tax administration in the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the points of sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of compulsory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils at a reduced rate of tax or exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and in the Slovak Republic (2014), a new control tape or a stamp containing an identification code was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">It is not yet possible to assess the impacts due to the short effectiveness of the legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol with a check mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic can also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-client approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">The Czech Republic's approach, on the other hand, is rather restrictive, as it introduces a bond that burdens the cash flow of tax entities, but it further reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="342">Evolution of revenue from excise duties</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the state to increase revenue for the state budget as well as to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to individuals and / or society (the regulatory function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Communication from the Commission: Europe 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.3.2010 under the flagship initiative "Resource efficient Europe," the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including by revising energy taxation to reduce energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxation, among other things, as part of a greater "greening" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of tax revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), among others, monitors the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="348">The two supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter a query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP decreased slightly, according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">The ECB's European Central Bank rate was used to convert the amounts in CZK into €at 31 December of the relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against €in 2013 decreased by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Bank Board of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of collection of excise duties, rates of excise duties and per capita income in €decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off shortfall in revenue from excise duty on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also affected by the increase in the collection of income taxes, which has increased significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">Excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the total collection of excise duties (around 55.7% in 2015), but this has fallen compared to 2012, despite significant economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duties on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although the registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend towards environmentally friendly vehicles and the promotion of biofuels have a negative impact on tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">Gas, solid fuel and electricity taxes account for a negligible share, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="361">If rates are not increased, their share will decrease in the future due to the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in 2013 and 2014 has been negatively affected by the repercussions of a large tax fraud case involving the putting into circulation of untaxed ethyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured ethyl alcohol in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such behaviour and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the collection of 2012 by €4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of the tax on tobacco products has increased as a result of rising rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The standard rates of excise duties changed between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on tobacco products, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011 / 64 / EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, apart from the tax on tobacco products, has fallen significantly. For tobacco products, it has risen only slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">There is no indexation of the excise rate in relation to price growth, GDP or standard of living, so the function of excise duties to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the rise in living standards, real rates of excise duties are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation - the automatic adjustment of an economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment takes place on the basis of a law or a contract (for pensions paid by the state it is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="371">The current legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic does not address the indexation of the level of excise duty rates to the development of consumer prices, as they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="374">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all the excise duties introduced in Slovakia, excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the state budget's annual tax revenue, while its share did not fall below 52% during the whole audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">Excise duty on tobacco products accounts for the second largest share.</seg>
<seg id="378">On average, this tax accounts for around 32% of the total collection of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per capita in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to an increase in excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth in the collection of excise duties per capita in the Slovak Republic is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in €per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention on the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which in the Czech Republic is about 2.7 and 2.8 times higher respectively, but per capita of the Czech Republic the collection of these selected products is only about 1 / 3 higher.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK to €for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">In the case of the tax on mineral oils, this is also due to greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of the tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a significant impact.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic fell as a result of the CNB's interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not increasing and there is no shift from labour taxation to taxation of the consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the share of excise duties achieved is consistently above the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is mainly influenced by the change in excise duty rates, the development of the economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures, which are subsidised by the state in various forms, will have to be compensated by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="392">The absence of indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic reduces their regulatory function and does not sufficiently support the EU's objectives of a Europe less dependent on environmentally unfriendly resources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic is reflected in the higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of the administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of the tax administration in administering the tax affects the scope and organisational organisation of the tax administration, the management of the organisation, the legal environment and the level of computerisation of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The calculation of the efficiency of the administrative costs of the administration of the tax using the conversion factor method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a line-managed structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organisational unit of the state and an accounting unit.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is carried out by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs authorities are an internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included cumulatively for the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, the expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial control tasks are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">Excise duties are mainly administered by the following departments:</seg>

<seg id="435">The creation of the SR CCP was also reflected in the composition of the staff of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the context of the exercise of the administration of excise duties, activities related to the administration of excise duties within the organisational structure of the CCP have been integrated into a number of different sections and related departments.</seg>

<seg id="452">Although revenue from excise duties increased, expenditure increased faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure in the Slovak Republic is significantly influenced by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">The expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the administration of excise duties increased significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, mainly due to the increase in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties grew at about the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Compared to the Slovak Republic, wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the broader competences of the customs administration, such as weighing trucks, checking compliance with obligations related to tolls.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in Slovakia shows a slightly worsening trend year on year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee increased.</seg>
<seg id="459">In the Czech Republic, too, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee grew more slowly than in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, wage growth is an important factor in the deterioration in the efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be assessed as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in the administration of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, as confirmed by the undecreasing number of employees in the field of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="463">In the Slovak Republic, however, the administration of excise duties with lower revenues is significantly more demanding in terms of staff capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of excise tax administration</seg>
<seg id="465">The management of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the administration of excise duties are the assessment of taxes, the authorisation and registration of activities, the supervision of transport, the control and search of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="467">The number of administrative tasks and entities managed is an indicator of the performance of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the indicator monitored and the number of tax administrations reflects the efficiency of the tax administration's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisation and registration for the activity are essential prerequisites for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax authority is obliged to carry out a continuous administration of entities authorised or registered, with a focus on supervising compliance with the legislation and conditions laid down by the tax authority, to which adequate staff resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The indicator monitored was the number of valid permits or registrations to operate at 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in a matter.</seg>
<seg id="474">The administrative tasks monitored are the most important tasks of the tax administration (claims of the tax, administration of transport in EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of acts ending in a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Authorisation and registration to operate in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">Selected products may be produced, processed, stored, received or dispatched on the basis of a tax authority's authorisation to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the operator of a tax warehouse has more than one warehouse, a permit is issued for each one separately, including the security of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="480">The security of the tax is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax authority (i.e. the physical presence of a public official and the securing of the facilities by the tax authority's conclusions).</seg>
<seg id="481">Permanent tax supervision does not apply in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="482">The operator of the tax warehouse is also registered for tax under Section 125 of Act No 280 / 2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">Authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products conditionally exempt from tax from the place of import to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to a place of export in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replacing the status of registered consignor under Article 4 (10) of Council Directive 2008 / 118 / EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels without tax, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.</seg>
<seg id="485">The producer brandy produces alcohol at a reduced rate of 50% tax (14,300 CZK / hl ethanol) - fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the operating permit is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of the grower for personal consumption during the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The register of crop burning, which is kept by the operators of the brandy and made available to the tax authorities, must contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">The authorised recipient for the repeated receipt of selected products and the authorised recipient for the one-off receipt of selected products shall be entitled, subject to the authorisation of the tax authority and the conditions laid down, to receive or repeatedly receive selected products in a conditional system transported from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and is not allowed to store or dispatch the selected products under the conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of the selected exempt products is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or under Section 52a or Section 53 of Act No 353 / 2003 Coll. sells to another user the selected exempt products; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="491">The acceptance and use of selected products exempt from tax can only take place on the basis of a final authorisation, and only from the supplier specified in the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of the authorisation, the exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of the authorisation for use or to a user who is entitled to use the mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">It is possible to sell tax-free mineral oils without authorisation in statutory cases, such as:</seg>
<seg id="494">Waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if produced by the user himself or in the course of his activities,</seg>
<seg id="495">Exempted mineral oils collected in unit packs of a maximum capacity of 20 litres, intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production and intended for sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">It is possible to transport selected products exempt from tax with proof of exemption.</seg>
<seg id="497">After compulsory registration with the tax authorities, the distributor of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled to sell or otherwise transfer the ethyl alcohol put into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="498">The storer of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, on the basis of registration with the tax authorities and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="499">A person handling special mineral oils is entitled, on the basis of registration with the tax authorities and the conditions laid down, to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils which are in bulk or placed in packages of more than 220 litres.</seg>
<seg id="500">The fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel on the territory of the Czech Republic, with the exception of the sale of fuel from a service station, on the basis of the concession issued and the registration of the tax authority under the specified conditions.</seg>
<seg id="501">PHM transport must be accompanied by a tax document, proof of sale or proof of transport, or a delivery plan and bottling tickets.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent to the tax authorities prior to the start of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="503">The service station operator is the owner of the fuel sold at the service station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where the sale or delivery of PHM to a fuel tank is usually permitted on the basis of a permit from the building authority.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators in a breakdown into: Registered - normal sale or delivery of PHM usually to the fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined approach - operation usually in different company premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, construction yards), sale there for the other side is limited on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public - delivery points of fuel only for the operators' own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="506">A service station is not a building or installation in the form of an operating tank located in operation (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is dispensed only for its own use.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to the permission of the tax authorities and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free circulation for resale, subject to authorisation by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="509">They must also be authorised when they purchase or obtain liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">Tax control is a set of actions. The subject of tax control is tax obligations, claims by the tax entity or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="512">A tax audit may be carried out jointly for several tax procedures of a single tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">A repeat tax inspection can only be carried out under the conditions and justification laid down by law at the start of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tax audit is carried out within the deadline for determining the tax, which is three years, with the deadline being extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. submission of additional tax proceedings, initiation of criminal proceedings in relation to the tax in question) or suspended (court proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The period for determining the tax shall end no later than 10 years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">There is no obligation on the tax authorities to carry out a tax audit on each tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">The start of the tax audit suspends the deadlines for the possibility of submitting an additional tax return or an additional statement by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No 280 / 2009 Coll.) and restarts the period for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No 280 / 2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">On the basis of its result, the tax can be assessed ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax authority searches for evidence and inspects premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging from tax entities and other persons involved in the tax administration, in a place outside the premises of the tax authority (e.g. at the tax entity, at the point of sale, on the way to transport).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax authority is entitled to borrow documents and items, take samples and, if necessary, secure them.</seg>
<seg id="521">Based on the outcome of the local investigation, the tax cannot be assessed separately, but the taxpayer can be asked to submit an additional tax return (Section 145 (2) of Act No 280 / 2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">The EMCS traffic data check is not a local survey.</seg>
<seg id="523">The order for alcohol marking control tapes can only be submitted to the tax authority at the local marking point by a registered person obliged to mark alcohol and is carried out by means of intelligent forms, which are automatically imported into the application of the alcohol marking register.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax authority will process the order, evaluate the adequacy of the quantity of control tapes ordered and order the production.</seg>
<seg id="525">It does not supervise the production of control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="526">The production is carried out by the State Printing House of Cenin, a state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="527">The purchaser of the control tapes takes over the control tapes from the tax authority of the local marking point.</seg>
<seg id="528">Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco serves as a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco label corresponds to the amount of the tax liability, with the purchaser of the tobacco stickers obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their removal from the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate the value corresponding to the amount of tax liability of the ordered tobacco stickers in the order.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period shall apply only if the value of the tobacco stickers is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order for tobacco stickers is submitted on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance in writing or through a data container with the possibility of using intelligent forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco stickers is carried out by the State Printing House of Cenin, a state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorised tax authority, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (Kutná Hora Regional Office), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax authority, which distributes them and further examines their transport, storage and use with customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include regular tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco stickers, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">The following are not included: Mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of business other than for the production of heat or the propulsion of engines, mineral oils used for primary agricultural production.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with identified infringements, which are a set of successive administrative acts. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389 / 2012 takes the form of: Requests for administrative cooperation, replies to requests for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, occurrence reports, inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport taking place under a conditional exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax authority of the receiving or sending tax warehouse or the authorised consignee.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="540">Authorisation and registration to operate in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="541">The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is mainly carried out by the customs authorities and the excise department of the Customs and Tax Department of the Slovak Republic, whose procedure for the administration of excise duties is governed by individual laws on excise duties and the tax code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws lay down not only the scope of the authorisation for the CÚ and the CCP in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was due to an increase in permits issued within tax warehouses, an increase in the registration of the authorised recipient for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the obligation to notify when they are transported in bulk or in packaging containing more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to control and transport procedures to include other goods, such as anti-knock products, oxidation inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, viscosity enhancers, anti-corrosion products.</seg>
<seg id="545">For lubricating oils, a mandatory indication of their kinematic viscosity has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="546">An approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic can be found in the following parts of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering the operator of a tax warehouse within all excise items, a person who wants to operate a tax warehouse must also apply for registration and authorisation to operate a tax warehouse at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="549">The final decision in the registration process is the certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, by which the operator of the tax warehouse acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CÚ will issue a permit for the operation of a tax warehouse, which entitles the operator of a tax warehouse in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="551">Where the operator of a tax warehouse has tax warehouses in several locations, the tax authority will issue a separate permit for each tax warehouse to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The movement of excise goods under suspension of duty shall be monitored electronically through the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each shipment, known as</seg>
<seg id="554">Arc code under which the traffic can be tracked online and thus in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the operator of the tax warehouse is also a person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to electronically notify the CÚ of the trade name of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free circulation for tax purposes, at the latest on the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered consignor</seg>
<seg id="557">A registered consignor is a special type of tax entity which cannot be simultaneously registered as a tax warehouse operator even if it consigns an excise item under a duty suspension arrangement after it has been released for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a registered consignor under all excise items, a person who wishes to send an excise item under the conditional exemption procedure after it has been placed under the "free circulation" customs procedure must also apply to the CÚ at the same time for registration and authorisation to send an excise item under that procedure.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CÚ issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time also issues an authorisation to dispatch an excise object under a suspensive procedure after it has been placed under the customs procedure "free circulation."</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing spirit</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic task for the operation of the growing brandy is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the authorisation from the Ministry itself does not entitle the holder of the licence to operate the growing brandy.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order to be able to operate a growing brandy, a person must submit an application to the CÚ for registration and the issue of a registration certificate for the operator of the growing brandy.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CÚ issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which at the same time entitles the operator of the growing brandy to produce alcohol in the growing brandy.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of growing brandy is to provide a service to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Growing spirit cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislator allows a reduced tax rate of 50% of the standard rate of tax, i.e. €540 / hl a, to be applied to ethyl alcohol produced in brandy.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced tax rate shall apply to ethyl alcohol produced in a growing brandy in a quantity not exceeding 43 l a. per grower and per household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and it is therefore possible to apply a reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced more than once in one calendar year because the alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">It concerns the production of ethyl alcohol outside the conditional exemption scheme, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free circulation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays not only excise duty and value added tax on the alcohol produced, but also the price of the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The grower's brandy issues the grower with a removal certificate, which serves not only as proof of the origin and method of obtaining the alcohol, but also as proof of payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of alcohol produced in this way is not subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of immediate packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country in the course of their business and to put it into free circulation for tax purposes in the tax territory to apply to the CÚ for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA issues him with a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate entitles the importer to import consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the control stamps, he must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the amount of tax due on the quantity of alcohol or cigarettes he wishes to put into free circulation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of consumer packaging is required to put into free circulation for tax purposes only consumer packaging bearing a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, they must submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the control marks exported to the territory of the third country.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer is required to have the number of control marks imported back from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of import.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds within the meaning of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also included in the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the event of the release for free circulation of consumer packaging, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the importer of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol is also the person authorised to distribute the ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to electronically notify the CÚ of the commercial name of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free circulation for tax purposes, no later than the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for the seller of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person who wants to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CÚ for a permit and meet the legal conditions (business license for commercial activities; good repute in relation to intentional economic crimes; no permit for sale has been withdrawn for ten years; he is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the way in which the consumer packaging of alcohol is purchased.</seg>
<seg id="592">For each establishment, the authorisation holder shall keep a record per calendar month of the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received, the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packages of ethyl alcohol as at the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packages of ethyl alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase ethyl alcohol in the course of business only from the person authorised to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of immediate packaging of alcohol</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for the distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person who wishes to hold a distribution licence must apply to the CA for a distribution licence.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must meet the legal conditions (business licence for a commercial trade; storage area exceeds 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least €100,000 or paid-up equity of at least €100,000; minimum number of 10 employees; no arrears to the customs office; no arrears in compulsory contributions; good repute in relation to intentional economic crimes; no permit to sell has been withdrawn for 10 years; no liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As it is a consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation, is sufficient to prove the way in which the consumer packaging of alcohol is purchased.</seg>
<seg id="600">For each establishment, the holder of a distribution authorisation shall keep a record per calendar month of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol as at the last day of the month and a record of the shortfall or surplus in the number of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to purchase the alcohol in the immediate packaging only from another person authorised for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="602">The data for each calendar month shall be communicated electronically by the person authorised to distribute by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Fuel dealer</seg>
<seg id="604">A new type of tax entity, namely the fuel seller, has been introduced to monitor fuel in free circulation and to eliminate tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation governing service stations in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="606">That is why petrol stations are incorporated in the national legislation of the Slovak Republic as fuel sellers.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person who wishes to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free circulation for tax purposes in the course of a business activity in the tax territory is required to apply to the CÚ for a permit to sell before the sale begins and to provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with suitable verified measuring equipment allowing the quantity of mineral oil to be measured at the time of receipt and delivery, and the tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the seller of fuel is a tax warehouse operator, an authorised consignee or a registered consignor, the CÚ will also automatically issue a permit for the sale of fuel to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">The seller of fuel is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep records of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold per calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CA of the new supplier (distributor) of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="610">The seller of fuel is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the distributor of fuel or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when the fuel is delivered via a car tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottler from a measuring device built into the car tank when the fuel is pumped out.</seg>
<seg id="613">That document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax authority, is sufficient to prove how the fuel was purchased.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax authority in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="616">In particular, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks during transport, which is why hauliers use secondary roads, circumventing the toll collection system due to the difficulty of monitoring actual traffic.</seg>
<seg id="617">The transport of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tanks is also carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">It happens many times that illegal traffic is accompanied by a vehicle, which carriers report possible mobile patrols in order to change the route and avoid roadside checks.</seg>
<seg id="619">The fuel is also mixed with light fuel oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel Distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">A new type of tax entity, the fuel distributor, has been introduced in order to monitor fuel in free circulation and to eliminate tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person intending to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for tax purposes in the tax territory as part of a business activity shall, before distribution begins, apply to the customs office for a distribution permit and provide proof that the storage facility is verified and equipped with appropriate verified measuring equipment, as well as a list of suppliers and customers.</seg>
<seg id="623">The fuel distributor is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep separate records of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold per calendar month for each establishment.</seg>
<seg id="624">A fuel distributor is required by law to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">A fuel distributor may only sell to a fuel distributor, a registered person or a fuel consumer in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when the fuel is delivered via a car tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottler from a measuring device built into the car tank when the fuel is pumped out by the fuel sellers or the fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="627">That document shall include, in addition to the quantity data, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor or registered person assigned by the tax authority, is sufficient to prove how the fuel was purchased.</seg>
<seg id="630">Fuel consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">The consumer of fuel has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation for his own consumption in the tax territory and stores that mineral oil in a storage facility with a capacity of 15 000 litres or more shall notify the customs office at the latest before the first placing in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">Consumers of fuel shall be registered by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to the legal facts, he is obliged to give the address of the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage facility shall be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the quantity of propellants to be measured at the time of reception and delivery (stop sign, measuring rod).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must only purchase fuel from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As the fuel is in free circulation for tax purposes, no accompanying document is required for the transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when the fuel is delivered via a car tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottler from a measuring device built into the car tank when the fuel is pumped to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">That document shall contain, in addition to the data relating to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax authority, is sufficient to prove how the fuel was purchased.</seg>
<seg id="643">The tax authority in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the course of his business and meets the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Subject to the conditions laid down by law, a small independent brewery can apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. €2,652 per hl / percentage of the actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to up to 200 000 hectolitres of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As it concerns the production of beer outside the conditional exemption scheme, there is no need for an accompanying document for transport as it is in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family businesses, which also operate restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own beer for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative tasks in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter approximates the exercise of tax supervision by the administration of excise duties on selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative tasks (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was due to more EMCS shipments.</seg>
<seg id="654">In contrast, the biggest year-on-year decrease was recorded in 2014, by up to 4.3%, which was due to fewer completed tax checks and fewer filed tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="655">This decrease related to legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax controls</seg>
<seg id="657">By carrying out a tax audit, the CÚ ascertains or examines the facts relevant to the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">When carrying out a tax audit, the employees of the CÚ are shown a mandate to carry out a tax audit, which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject matter of the audit and the scope of the audited tax years.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period can be one month, but also more than one tax year.</seg>
<seg id="660">The scope of the audited tax years is determined by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="661">The tax audit begins with the drawing up of a report on the start of the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="662">The CA will confirm receipt of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="663">The loaned documents are to be returned to the CÚ within 30 days of the completion of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="664">The CA staff member draws up a report from the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax audit reveals a difference in the sum to be paid, declared or claimed by the audited taxpayer, the CÚ, together with the protocol, will also send the audited taxpayer an invitation to comment on the findings set out in the report.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax inspection shall be completed on the date of receipt of the report.</seg>
<seg id="667">The time limit for carrying out a tax audit shall be no more than one year from the date of its initiation.</seg>
<seg id="668">The tax inspection of registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once before the date of expiry of the right to determine the tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FR SR issued an internal management act which adjusted the above deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax administration in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigation</seg>
<seg id="671">A local investigation is the activity of the tax authority, in which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains facts that are necessary for the purposes of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">A member of the CA staff draws up a report on the local investigation and submits a copy to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="673">When carrying out a local investigation, a CA employee has the right to unlimited access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places, including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The settlement of the quantity of alcohol produced shall be determined by means of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The facts established are the basis for the exercise of the tax control.</seg>
<seg id="676">Also in the performance of the local investigation, the CÚ is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the case.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FR SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and local investigations for individual excise items in order to harmonise the procedures of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there was also a change in the area of the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the management of excise duty on alcohol, the improvement of the business environment in the area and the introduction of legislative instruments for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in relation to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative amendment was not only the transfer of the excise tax administration from the tax authorities to the customs authorities, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administration to be present in the tax warehouse for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation exhaustively defines that it is only possible to receive, supply, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse in the presence of a CA employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches alcohol only in the immediate packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CÚ is obliged to provide for employees in the tax warehouse so as not to restrict the income, supply, production or processing of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="685">The operator of the tax warehouse is obliged to ensure the conditions of the working environment for the employees of the CA.</seg>
<seg id="686">On the basis of a contract concluded with the Ministry of Finance for the premises provided, the Ministry of Finance pays the operator of the tax warehouse the rental costs on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="687">In the tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of ethyl alcohol, the production facility for the storage of ethyl alcohol must be adapted so that the quantities of ethyl alcohol produced, processed ethyl alcohol, stored ethyl alcohol, including the stocks of ethyl alcohol and alcohol contained therein, can be ascertained at any time.</seg>
<seg id="688">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">Where ethyl alcohol is not accepted, issued, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of an employee of the customs office, which it is obliged to secure by closing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this option is not used very often, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some operators of the tax warehouse use a legal option within the meaning of Act No 467 / 2002 Z. z., on the production and marketing of ethyl alcohol, and use production facilities for the production of ethyl alcohol in the distillery for the production of the distillery and also for the purposes of the distillery, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Around 250 customs officers provide permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issue of vouchers for the collection of alcohol control stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of control stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration sampling number and to issue a voucher for the collection of control stamps for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="695">Alcoholic beverages, which are ethyl alcohol, are goods of Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength by volume of more than 1,2%.</seg>
<seg id="696">The control mark is intended for the labelling of the consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">A sealed container filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption is considered to be a consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging of Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be put into free circulation for tax purposes in the tax territory only if it is marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorised consignee and the importer of the consumer packaging, who will put it into free circulation for tax purposes, may mark the consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="700">The control mark contains, among other things, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number contains the registration sampling number (1-6 instead of the numerical character), the volume of alcohol (7-11 instead of the numerical character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the immediate packaging (12-14 instead of the numerical character).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original model of the ethyl alcohol control mark:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration number will be assigned separately by the CÚ to each customer of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a control mark, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the immediate packaging, the volume concentration of alcohol in the immediate packaging and the customer's control mark, may be used to mark the immediate packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the end of 2014, national legislation brought about the introduction of a new information system for control marks.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorised consignee, the importer of the consumer packaging and the consignee (purchaser) of the alcohol can mark the consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="707">A purchaser of control stamps who wishes to collect control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of control stamps is obliged to request their issue, to report data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of pieces of stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or a multiple thereof.</seg>
<seg id="710">The tax authority also communicates with customers of control stamps through an electronic system of control stamps, in particular when announcing the number of control marks that the customer of control stamps can remove or when determining the date of receipt of control marks by the customer of control stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="711">Before accepting the stamps, the purchaser of the stamps is obliged to deposit into the account of the tax authority funds corresponding to the price of the stamps, which he can withdraw and the quantity of which is notified to him by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the stamp takes into account the amount of refunds to the printer, but it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">The state-owned company Mincovna Kremnice is entitled to print the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="714">FR SR carries out tax supervision of the handling of control stamps and their liquidation in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="715">Fr SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the financial directorate in the printing works when handling the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="716">FR SR ensures the sale of control stamps to the purchaser of control stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="717">Check marks can only be taken from a member of staff of the Financial Directorate at the printer.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issue of vouchers for the collection of control stamps for tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="719">The purchaser of the control mark must ask the CA to assign a registration number and issue a voucher for the collection of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be put into free circulation for tax purposes if it is marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is only possible to mark the consumer packaging of cigarettes with a control mark in a company which produces cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">Only the operator of a tax warehouse, an authorised consignee or an importer of tobacco products who wishes to put tobacco products into free circulation for tax purposes in the tax territory can be a purchaser of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only a control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the details of which correspond to the relevant price of the cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the package, the length of the cigarettes, the validity of the tax rate and the registration number.</seg>
<seg id="724">The consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">At the end of 2014, national legislation brought about the introduction of a new information system for control marks.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks for the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">A purchaser of control stamps who wishes to collect control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of control stamps is obliged to request their issue, to report data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of control marks.</seg>

<seg id="734">The operator of the tax warehouse or the importer of tobacco products may mark the consumer packaging of tobacco with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="735">The operator of the tax warehouse, the importer of tobacco products or the authorised consignee may mark the consumer packaging of cigars or cigarillos with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="736">To mark the packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos for consumption, only a control mark shall be used, the particulars of which correspond to the mark for the validity of the rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="737">It is only possible to mark the consumer packaging of cigarettes with a control mark in the company that produced them.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of pieces of stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or a multiple thereof.</seg>
<seg id="739">Within three working days at the latest, the CÚ will electronically notify the purchaser of the control marks of the number of control marks that it can withdraw, the price of the control marks and the account number of the CPP SR.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CÚ may reduce the number of pieces of control stamps ordered if there are circumstances on the basis of which it can reasonably be assumed that there may be an infringement of tax rules.</seg>
<seg id="741">Fr SR will set a date for the acceptance of the control marks by the purchaser of the control marks, but no later than 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The date of receipt of the control marks will be announced by the Slovak Ministry via the electronic system of control marks to the purchaser of the control marks.</seg>
<seg id="743">The stamps are issued by the Finance Directorate exclusively in the printing works, but only after the receipt of the funds corresponding to their price into the relevant account indicated in the electronic notification to the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="744">The purchaser of the control marks is required to keep a separate register of the control marks in the electronic system of control marks, broken down for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="745">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)</seg>
<seg id="746">Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389 / 2012, the ELO and SPD Systems Unit of the Excise Duty Department of the CCP is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information following a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the relevant financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="747">These include, in particular, requests for verification of entities within the excise administration, requests for information relating to the excise administration, as well as requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications shall take place in electronic form within the framework of the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following actions are included in administrative cooperation between EU Member States: Requests for administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on excise administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEED); response to request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the Slovak Republic, permanent tax supervision is applied to tax warehouses for alcohol; in the Czech Republic, this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by the tax administration through a monitoring device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are a tax warehouse; in the Slovak Republic, they are only registered by the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="755">The institute of registered consignor, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic, is established in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In the Slovak Republic, it is possible to burn 43 litres a at a reduced rate of excise duty on ethyl alcohol in the case of crop burning.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can only be applied to 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">Cultivation brandy in the Slovak Republic must be authorised not only by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows the production of brandy.</seg>
<seg id="760">In SR, in addition to the operator of the tax warehouse, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is also carried out by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The importer's authorisation is subject to the registration of the applicant with the excise authority.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax authority is required for the import of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In the Slovak Republic, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is subject to the issue of a permit by the tax authority for the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records of, among other things, purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax authority does not issue any permit for the final sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the trade office; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In SR, the seller of fuel must have permission from the tax authorities to sell it.</seg>
<seg id="767">National legislation in the Slovak Republic does not provide for any special regulation of petrol stations, all activities relating to petrol stations are regulated only in the law on excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax authority does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Service stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the Slovak Republic, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">There has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities in the Slovak Republic since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="775">In the Slovak Republic, the substantive legislation provides for the obligation to carry out tax checks on selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified in the internal management act issued by the SR CCP for the purpose of applying a uniform procedure for tax administrations in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, the substantive legislation does not provide for the obligation to carry out a tax inspection; the procedural law only provides for the possibility of carrying out an inspection at the latest by the deadline for the assessment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks and local investigations carried out in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the Slovak Republic stipulates in which cases and within what time limits the tax authority must carry out a tax check, while in the Czech Republic the accuracy of the amount of excise duty declared or its refund is verified mainly by a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 as a result of the increase in the number of shipments in the EMCS system and the increase in the number of tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the Slovak Republic, the number of administrative tasks had a slightly increasing trend between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the increasing number of shipments in the EMCS system as well as the decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities have been reflected in the different legislation.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrations was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the different years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In the Slovak Republic, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds of the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same number of administrative tasks.</seg>
<seg id="785">From this it can be concluded that SR is more focused on the implementation of administrative tasks by tax administrations, e.g. the exercise of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote surveillance, e.g. tracking devices, immediate sending of data via a web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Computerisation of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Computerization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">The tax return can be filed through a data container.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, which can no longer be processed in an automated way.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must also be transferred to the personal tax account of the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is a reduction in the error rate of filed tax returns (DAP), which saves the tax administration's actions related to the procedure for correcting erroneously filed DAP.</seg>
<seg id="793">GŘC is working on a new application for electronic processing of DAP.</seg>
<seg id="794">In addition, smart forms can: Submit tax applications or registration for activities and notification of changes in data, claim refunds, comply with reporting obligations for the handling of special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the information system ORO webclient, which is available for registered entities for registration by the tax authority of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">The transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the conditional exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">The transport of selected products in free circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, a decision by the customs office to place selected products under a customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision on the assessment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is laid down by law.</seg>
<seg id="799">In order to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353 / 2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to a data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">Jik is used for the purpose of control by customs authorities on the way and prevents repeated transport on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of a fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, CS ČR has online access to an electronic registration system in which the entity automatically stores the issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS ČR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for recording and monitoring shipments of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should make use of 70% of the current EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for both declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be linked to a system of global guarantees, a register of tax entities or a system of risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of shipments in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and the sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current procedure for recording shipments of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the misuse of a simplified accompanying document, the repeated use of a single document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Computerisation of administrative tasks in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="810">In the administration of excise duties, the Slovak tax administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the conditional exemption regime, check marks, submission of tax returns, as well as registration and registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">One-way electronic communication between tax entities and the tax administration was also introduced in 2014, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">In the context of electronic communication, the taxpayer has access to a personal internet zone, called an electronic personal mailbox, which is designed for communication with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic mailroom through which he submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication via a personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines the tax entities that are required to communicate electronically with the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are mainly value added tax payers, tax advisers representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">During the audit, the SAO SR also dealt with the issue of the scope of the computerization of the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communications within the ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">Apart from the transport carried out in EMCS, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">Fully computerised processing of the tax return is already in place in the Slovak Republic, from its filing to the registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">Electronic processing of tax returns is not set up in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the option is set up for tax entities to enter on the website compulsory documents for individual shipments in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the declaration of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of EMCS is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting shipments in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in the Slovak Republic in the field of computerization of tax returns, the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend completing the computerization of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organisational structure and staffing in the field of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisational arrangements of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic have undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">Since 1 January 2013, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been composed of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">The GŘC is an accounting unit for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out a comprehensive administration of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS ČR continues to carry out:</seg>
<seg id="838">(A) inspection:</seg>
<seg id="839">In the field of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of infrastructure charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">Management of waste and packaging material;</seg>
<seg id="841">The safety of imported food,</seg>
<seg id="842">In the field of consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">Employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">(B) customs administration - it is a complex application of customs legislation, commercial policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods;</seg>
<seg id="845">(C) the collection and recovery of pecuniary benefits imposed by other public authorities in the context of a split administration;</seg>
<seg id="846">(D) the activities of the police authority (designated customs authorities) in proceedings concerning offences committed in breach of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="847">While the scope of competences (concurrence of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are economies of scale as the public administration does not have to spend on the status of a control group for each subject of control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, there is a reduction in the administrative burden on the persons checked by repeated checks.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also carries out from 1 December 2016 the task of verifying compliance with obligations in the registration of sales (Section 2 (2) of Act No. 112 / 2016 Coll., on the registration of sales) and from 1 January 2017 the supervision of compliance with the law and the conditions for the operation of gambling, including the imposition of sanctions (Section 116 of Act No. 186 / 2016 Coll., on gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">As part of the project Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-stage structure to a two-stage structure with effect from 1 January 2013, with the abolition of the central article of the procedure (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">GŘC spent approximately CZK 51 million on the project (i.e. approximately €2,031,000).</seg>
<seg id="852">Since 1 January 2013, CS ČR has been made up of GŘC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">The customs offices and their competences are laid down by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.</seg>
<seg id="854">The territorial offices are the internal organisational units of the customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled by decree to set up and abolish territorial workplaces and to determine their material scope.</seg>
<seg id="856">The legislation does not provide for any competence for the territorial office; the territorial office exercises the competence of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organizational structure until 31 December 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure as of 1 January 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Until 31 December 2012, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the GŘC, eight CŘ and 58 CÚ departments (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 departments and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1 January 2016, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the GŘC and 51 departments at the CÚ and their territorial offices, as well as eight offices of the legal department of the GŘC and the departments of the CÚ providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 places.</seg>
<seg id="861">The costs of CS CR are most significantly influenced by wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there have been no savings in personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is carried out by customs officers in the service of the law on the service of members of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the number of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, as according to the provisions of Section 42 (1) of Act No 361 / 2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">The reduction of posts due to organisational changes in the security force is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure that members are assigned adequate posts within the force, or to provide posts with another security force (e.g. the Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will be transferred to a reserve for the temporarily non-attached, in which members of the security forces are entitled to 80% of the average service income according to the law.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organisation of excise administration in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="868">In the framework of the programme statement for the years 2012 to 2016, the government of the Slovak Republic has set as one of its priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will provide additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, duties and levies and curbing tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of a financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">FR SR was established on 1 January 2012 by Act No. 333 / 2011 Z. z., on state administrative bodies in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization, which is based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">Fr SR, CÚ and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199 / 2004 Z. z., the Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain laws, as amended, are customs authorities when they carry out tasks according to customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Act No. 333 / 2011 Z. z., on State Administration Bodies in the Field of Taxes, Fees and Customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities, they form a financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competence Centre for Financial Operations, tax offices, the Tax Office for Selected Tax Entities, branches of tax offices, contact points of tax offices, customs offices, branches of customs offices (branch of the Tax Office, branch of the Combined Tax Office, branch of the Customs Office) and customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of the SR CCP is the effective collection and administration of taxes and duties, i.e. also excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the Slovak Finance Ministry is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration, and therefore also for the activities of the CCP, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">The organisational structure of the Slovak CCP since 1 January 2012 in an abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">In addition to branches of customs offices (38 branches) and stations of customs offices (18 stations), excise departments (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments) provide activities and processes in the field of excise administration within all customs offices in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="883">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organisational structure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic, 74 organisational units with a total of 1,300 employees were involved in the administration of excise duties in 2015, in addition to the Slovak Ministry of Finance; these units are managed by nearly 48,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organisational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, in 2015 the administration of excise duties was handled by about 60 organisational units with a total of 1,011 employees, which are managed by about 114,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of the various activities of the administration of excise duties is divided among several independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their coordination and cooperation is dealt with through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the Slovak Republic, the exercise of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise administration is divided between the excise department and the branch of the customs office, where the agenda is often dealt with by the same employees of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In the Slovak Republic, the number of tax entities is about a third of the total number of employees in the field of excise administration compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the effect of the higher number of employees on the efficiency of the excise administration is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble to Decision No 1152 / 2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the movement and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on the movement and to carry out the prescribed checks, to facilitate the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of the EP and Council Decision allows for the inclusion in the EMCS of national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and such technical or software as the Member State considers necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionalities of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">The EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">A customs module and a declarant module have been introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">In addition to the Community system, in the Czech Republic, EMCS monitors shipments under the conditional exemption regime, both initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">After approval of the notification of receipt of a consignment intended for an authorised consignee for a single receipt, the system ensures that the information is automatically sent to the register of tax entities, with subsequent invalidation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures the administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from the ELO, including the sending of replies with an annex in any format and providing translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a manual export termination message in the ECS (in the EU, only the transmission of an automatically created message is implemented).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS will not allow the approval of an e-AD or an admission notification without the competent customs authority responding to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The Declarant Module is available free of charge for tax entities, taking the form of a web application to which the user logs in with a username and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with CS ČR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Any action against the EMCS Customs Module shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declarant Module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and completed shipments under the conditional exemption regime, so that tax entities do not have to spend money to acquire the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module make it possible to load and store data offline (saving time on frequently used data), to fill in recipient data based on a SEED ID check and to require mandatory completion of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows every consignment sent from the Czech Republic to be blocked in real time from securing excise duty at the corresponding amount of taxable transactions until the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without a sufficient level of security, the EMCS declarant module is not allowed to send the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA of dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and includes the ARC of transportation (including the amount of security blocked) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The taxpayer can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight performance contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. €1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">During the audited period, expenditure of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438.99) was incurred for the upgrade of the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on upgrading EMCS in the audited period and converted into one transport contributed to EMCS is on average 16.49 CZK (i.e. 0.62 €), excluding national transport, this expenditure is 24.40 CZK (i.e. 0.92 €) per transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support was invoiced in the amount of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. €281,389.77) including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport contributed to EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">The invoices for both development and technical support related to the national solution and developed the EVV application, which was already operated by GŘC before EMCS itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">Invoices were paid as part of the programme funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services to other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under suspension of duty.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document - the SAD, which was used before the system came into effect, thereby ensuring better control and management of shipments.</seg>
<seg id="931">It has been in place in the Slovak Republic since 1 April 2010 and has been continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called "</seg>
<seg id="933">Arc code under which the traffic can be tracked online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionalities of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS system ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by tax entities authorised to use the EMCS system, thus greatly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest development in functionalities occurred in 2011, when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of EMCS has been implemented as an additional module of SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of EMCS was to replace a system based on paper-based transport administration.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefits of EMCS are a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU, from the announcement of the start of transport to the end of transport, with a significant reduction in administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities for processing, handing over and archiving documents.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, national functionality has been introduced into the EMCS system, allowing monitoring of traffic in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic respectively.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, the automatic functionality of online monitoring and the provision of a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">National functionality is also introduced, which monitors the riskiness of the tax entity or transport, followed by a mandatory response from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="946">The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU shipments in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, between 2012 and 2015, the expenditure incurred in the Slovak Republic to upgrade the system was €744,310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO of the Slovak Republic obtained data from the Slovak Ministry of Finance on the upgrade of the EMCS system only for the period from 2011, even though the system was introduced and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">However, the costs incurred for upgrading the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic were €188,134.44 higher than the costs for the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system in about ten years of operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">During the audited period, the amount of expenditure related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic per shipment is 2.3 times higher than the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation between the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic has achieved its objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the system of administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences between the two tax systems which affect the efficiency of excise administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">Parallel checks have identified examples of good practice that could contribute to reducing tax fraud, which will become increasingly important as tax rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures to reduce the costs of administering excise duties have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons unless coordinated due diligence is carried out with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of supreme audit institutions is indispensable.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Report on the results of a parallel audit of the VAT administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The 1977 Lima Declaration stresses that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be one of the most important components of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The VI. EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenue carried out by the SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">The development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue is an important step towards optimising SAI control activities.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies in particular to taxation as the bulkiest source of public revenue, which is the most vulnerable to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of another state's SAI.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes significant income losses in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to work together.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Sai, which carry out checks in this area, must be willing to cooperate more closely with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea arose to carry out an audit of the administration of value added tax ("VAT") and the VIES system in the framework of cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">This was followed by careful preparation, where both parties first had to familiarise themselves with the legal environment and procedures for administering VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of an analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was carried out and included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving an efficient and efficient VAT administration has been a long-standing challenge and individual states (especially European Union Member States) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of VAT more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our inspection can serve not only to improve the work of tax authorities, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel checks on the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06 / 27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Administration of value added tax after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the audit operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union ("EU") linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to exemption from value added tax for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system for the control of intra-community value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on the weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">The system of exchange of information on value added tax The audit actions were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the SAO") and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH") in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic") and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 31.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">A parallel inspection in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from the main point - exchanges of information based on Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2004 - the audit covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the inspection included the legal situation in the field of international bus passenger transport and a comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">A comparison of the VAT management systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, taxpayers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, which is used only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International passenger transport by bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus passenger transport is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">(3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic taxpayers only submit VAT returns for individual tax years (month or quarter), in Germany payers are obliged to submit so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of an obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">(4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic payers file summary reports at tax offices, in Germany payers file summary reports at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="53">The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have the data from the summary reports immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">The information from the recapitulative statements is only available to the German tax authorities after they have been processed into CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires up-to-date information on intra-Community transactions to be made available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements would reduce the time lag between the transaction date and the update of VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="57">This, in turn, would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the Member State of the customer (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">This would, however, require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for requests for information received.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the time elapsed.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax authorities dealt with a significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the prescribed period.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent warning (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">(6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS), which has its own strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two SAIs examined selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or suspicions of VAT evasion were examined using the CLO legislation.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities have used information obtained through international cooperation to assess the VAT liability of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers either wrongly claimed exemption of the supply from VAT or did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or unintelligible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax authorities of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases have been identified where payers erroneously reported business transactions in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the VIES data was incorrect and tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="79">Control event in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Section II - the revenue department of the state budget and the regional unions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited persons were: The Ministry of Finance (hereinafter "MF") and 10 tax offices - the Financial Office in Humpolec, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4, the Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinci.</seg>
<seg id="82">The audit conclusion of this audit action was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Progress of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the control group for indirect taxes and by the staff of the designated regional control offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The audit was part of the control plan for 2006 and was therefore notified to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later elected by the SAO, the BRH had to notify the audit to a number of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for Corporations / Legal Entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Centre (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for Large Enterprises (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-North), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn Centre (Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne Centre (Köln-Mitte), Kolín-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne South (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Budyshin (Bautzen), Chemnitz (South), Dresden II, Leipzig II and Dresden II.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, discussions were held with the Tax Office of Augsburg-Stadt (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old Town (Düsseldorf Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A report on the inspection findings was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">In preparation for the parallel control actions, several meetings of representatives of the two control institutions took place in the period prior to their launch.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants in these meetings were acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislation on VAT issues and the VAT administration system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">The topics of the test phase were agreed at a meeting held in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at a further joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">In the framework of this meeting, a timetable was agreed for the further progress of the work and the following topics of parallel controls were identified:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registration of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus passenger transport - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of the tax authorities when processing requests for information and examining selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistics on the supply and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the progress of the audit in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audit actions to date.</seg>
<seg id="111">A report on the results of parallel checks of the VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Plans who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">Under Act No 337 / 1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter "Act No 337 / 1992 Coll."), a taxpayer, a taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person, which is defined as a tax entity by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421 865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">As of 1 December 2005, the number of tax entities registered for VAT had increased to 457,590.</seg>
<seg id="118">A taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a payer from the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Section 94 (1) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter "Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.").</seg>
<seg id="119">This person is required to submit an application for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the registration of a taxable person so called retrospectively in cases where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to deduct may become a taxable person, even if he does not exceed a turnover of 1,000,000 CZK (33,575 EUR), if he fulfils any of the other conditions set out in Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not comply with any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for VAT registration on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure under Act No 337 / 1992 Coll., is initiated by the delivery of the registration application to the local tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="124">The voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on the VAT registration application the date on which he applies to be registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax authorities will check the information provided by the tax entity, i.e. the completed registration application with all annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If it has doubts about the data, it shall ask the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">After verifying that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, the tax authority issues a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number ("TIN").</seg>
<seg id="128">On the certificate, the tax authority shall indicate the effective date of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT tax year.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax year is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year was CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax year is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year was CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax year and will notify the tax authorities of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the TIN in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the tax entity is obliged to mention it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax authority and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The TIN contains the code "CZ" and the generic part, which consists of a general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number or other general identifier, if provided for by a special law, and for a legal person the identification number (Section 33 (12) of Act No 337 / 1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax entity has not fulfilled its registration obligation even at the request of the tax authority, it will be registered by the local tax authority of its own motion without delay.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issue of an ex officio registration certificate, which is served on the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is assigned a VAT number at the time of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same VAT number is used by the taxpayer even if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., which has been in force since 1 January 2005, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, the tax authority may order the taxable person to pay compensation of up to 10% of the total income or income for taxable transactions carried out by that person without tax for the period from the date on which he should have been a registered payer by law to the date on which he became a registered payer by decision of the tax authority (Section 98 (1) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a payment of tax (Section 98 (3) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">The cancellation of the VAT payer's registration if the conditions laid down by law are met is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">(1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover below the registration limit (Section 106 (1) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer shall be entitled to apply for deregistration no earlier than 1 year after the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">(2) Cancellation of registration "ex officio" (Section 106 (7) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.) if: (A) the payer has not carried out a transaction without notifying the tax authority of the reason for 12 consecutive months, (b) the payer has failed to fulfil his obligations under Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">(B) Plants who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who carries out a transaction with a place of supply in the Czech Republic and is liable to declare and pay tax on that transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. (The so-called "non-established payer"), becomes a payer on the date on which the transaction takes place.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is required to submit an application for registration to the Tax Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of performance.</seg>
<seg id="149">She is required to include in her registration application all the VAT numbers she has been assigned in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If the "non-established" payer applies for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Tax Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively because according to Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll. the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">Upon retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires tax entities to provide proof that the transaction has been carried out (invoices or explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a "non-established" tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable transaction takes place, then the Tax Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the transaction will take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 "non-established" payers were registered at the Tax Office for Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005, 951 "non-established" payers were registered, 233 of them from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Under the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. the tax authority is entitled to cancel the registration of a "non-established" payer on 31 January of the following calendar year if that payer has not incurred any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">An audit by the SAO found that if a "non-established" payer files a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal regulations by the deadline for filing a tax return, it is often not yet available to the tax office on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant to the possibility of deregistration are known to the tax office later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic to cancel the VAT registration of a "non-established" payer in a given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Paragraphs 137, 138 of the Abgabenordnung, "the AO"), anyone carrying on a business activity is required to inform the municipal / municipal authority or the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the municipal / municipal tax office.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax office identifies an enterprise that has started operations but has not registered, the competent tax office can register the payer ex officio - even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both resident and non-resident taxpayers in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act ("USTG").</seg>
<seg id="163">That obligation does not depend on the amount of turnover they make.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax offices for entrepreneurs living abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those based in the Czech Republic, the competent tax office is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">The BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">As the work permits of employees from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These businesses do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Section 2 of the USTG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way in which they perform their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by general departments, which are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form carries out a risk assessment of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the next three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are to distinguish the payers, the last being always the check-digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If a trader intends to engage in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intra-Community supply.</seg>
<seg id="178">Customs will assign a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="179">VAT ID is automatically allocated to businesses when payers declare intra-Community supplies in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT ID structure is a country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The registration of an entrepreneur may be cancelled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activities), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all business years) and 2. if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of a VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of a VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (Section 19 (1) of the USTG), tax residents in Germany are not required to pay VAT if 1. the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. in the following year it is not likely to exceed EUR 50 000.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small businesses ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other businesses for VAT and do not have the right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not required to pay VAT, small businesses must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small business may declare that it will not apply Paragraph 19 (1) of the USTG.</seg>
<seg id="188">That declaration is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The trader can then invoice the VAT and deduct the input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is possible for non-residents to appoint tax representatives (Section 22a of the USTG).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is a prerequisite that they carry out exclusively exempt commercial transactions and do not have the right to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit, it has the option to apply for VAT registration on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration process is standardized in Germany, but differences can occur as a result of different organizational models in federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same VAT number for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, when registering for VAT, the payer is assigned a tax number, which is used only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH have discovered, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax authority about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will allocate the TIN at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This TIN will be valid for the entire life of a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will apply for an economic TIN to be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the introduction of an IT resource to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International passenger transport by bus</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. with effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct.</seg>
<seg id="216">Such transport is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by a trader who is registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return service is considered to be a separate service.</seg>
<seg id="218">If "non-established" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5, paragraph 1, point (b), which states:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purposes of Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may continue the exemption from value added tax for international passenger transport referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier."</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of the legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Section 3b (1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place) where the transport takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore, the German tax system does not distinguish between domestic and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable supply of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also makes no distinction between residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany, the part of the route that takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable supply of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">A non-resident taxpayer must declare his intention to provide passenger transport to the relevant tax office before performing his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office registers this non-resident taxpayer for tax purposes (cf. 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is mentioned in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is required to declare his taxable supplies of transport in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers who were in the passenger transport business.</seg>
<seg id="231">Where passenger transport is provided to a resident taxpayer who is liable for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity liable to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident taxpayer receiving the services, a process known as "reverse charge" and in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the non-resident and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means of assessing the accuracy of the declared taxable supplies of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="234">The customs office's mobile control groups audit the certification of buses licensed for foreign transport, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, the mobile control groups send an audit report to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to claim VAT from the bus driver before continuing with the next transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident taxpayer may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce its intention to carry out an audit, which must be carried out at the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if a non-resident taxpayer refuses to pay the amount of VAT charged in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">In order to carry out a review of the VAT return or the performance of the non-resident's tax obligations, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable supplies of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, auditing the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer generates disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration must carry out an audit of foreign accounting, which means not only the need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to take more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport that takes place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer does not only have to accept the right to carry out an inspection, which is the responsibility of his national tax administration, but also the right to have an audit carried out by other Member States in which he carries passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, in each Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations applicable to him in those Member States, in all the languages and on all the tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between individual EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place in Germany is a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport is provided for the first time in Germany by a non-established payer, he is obliged to notify the competent tax office in advance of the provision of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers the payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable supplies of part of the transport in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">The implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are in the passenger transport business.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the effort, the tax revenue, if realised, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT shall be subject to time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate costs for charging VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider is based.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require the adaptation of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax year, even if he has not incurred tax liability, unless otherwise provided by law.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is due within the deadline for filing the VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., for which the tax is due according to the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If there is a refundable overpayment as a result of the over-deduction, the payer shall be returned without request within 30 days of the over-deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The time limit does not apply in cases where the tax authority initiates tax proceedings concerning the taxpayer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of Section 73 (11) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., the right to deduct may be exercised in the ordinary VAT return at the latest for the last tax year of the calendar year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">After that period, the right to deduct may continue to be exercised within three years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct could have been exercised at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible through the submission of an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">The amendment to Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, allows the submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if (a) by aggregating the corrections he increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction which does not change the last known tax liability, but only the data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) he makes a correction to the rate and amount of tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if, by aggregating the corrections, he reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The payer is required to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The submission of VAT returns in electronic form can be made either via the Internet or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Internet submission can be made as a submission with a data message accompanied by an advanced electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not accompanied by an advanced electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of a submission with a data message not accompanied by a guaranteed electronic signature, a written submission is still required, i.e. the delivery of the computer report to the tax authorities (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values of intra-Community supplies / acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">The values of the acquisition of services are recorded on the separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated control within ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of supplies of goods to other Member States to taxable persons registered in other Member States shall be compared with the data contained in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from taxable persons registered in other Member States shall be compared to those obtained through VIES from recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The tax office is conducting a test of the credibility of VAT returns under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is carried out automatically, as VAT returns cannot be assessed without a test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test includes the calculation of credibility criteria and the evaluation of risk types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No 337 / 1992 Coll. the tax office can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply with an obligation of a non-pecuniary nature arising from this or a special tax law, or imposed by a decision pursuant to this law, within a specified period.</seg>
<seg id="285">An automated tax information system used by the tax authorities to provide technical support to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The SAO audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the option to impose a fine on taxpayers for not filing a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small businesses who are not required to pay VAT have to submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">As a general rule, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (Section 18 (2) USTG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year, or if it is a newly created business, the trader concerned is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">A taxpayer may also choose to submit a monthly VAT return if there has been a refund in the past year that exceeds EUR 6 136 (Section 18 (2a) USTG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns do not have to be submitted if the annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax year in which the VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FO.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no time limits (according to the law) for the processing of tax returns and the refund of excess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to obtain a timely refund, it is possible to offer security for the amount to be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process the VAT returns and return the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act provides for the possibility of extending that period (Paragraph 18 (6) USTG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension should be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability one month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be submitted by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the trader cannot correct the incorrect preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">A correction of the annual VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the payer is possible within the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payers are required to submit their preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid excessive hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The annual VAT return can be submitted on paper or via the Internet, with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is carried out without certification, payers must submit a return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">In the event that the taxpayer does not submit a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the event of late submission, a penalty payment may be imposed on the payer (up to a maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">During a previous inspection, BRH found that the tax authorities often did not measure this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities have imposed a fine, the amount has been assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard fine therefore falls short of its objective of reducing the average delay, especially when filing an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies / acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">The values of the acquisition of services are recorded on the separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns which are submitted on paper, a copy must be made either through a scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data from the VAT returns submitted electronically is immediately available to the tax office official.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data has been entered into the system, RMS staff will go through it and select cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The VAT returns collected must be checked by an official of the tax office on the basis of an inspection report prepared by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(See section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration has to make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT that the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as precise as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers submit VAT returns within 25 days of the end of the tax year.</seg>
<seg id="329">The tax year is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month, depending on the amount of the payer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on the tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are required to submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in the (monthly provisional) tax returns by submitting a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- if the payer corrects the declared intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the reporting period;</seg>
<seg id="335">- The Länder do not usually compare VIES data on intra-Community purchases by German payers before the annual VAT return is processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German taxpayers are required to submit an annual VAT return, regardless of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German tax authority to examine the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and closing accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities are only able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover from filed income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of an obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to improving the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The recapitulative statement (hereinafter referred to as "SH") is submitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. by a payer who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person registered in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the goods delivered are always presented in Czech currency, broken down by individual tax entities, with their VAT ID, under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services provided are not included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH is submitted by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of the end of the period to the local tax office.</seg>
<seg id="348">The correction of incorrect data shall be carried out in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of detection of the errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect information given in the SH is always replaced by the information given in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">As well as tax returns, payers can also submit SH in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event that the payer does not file an SH or subsequent SH and should have filed it under Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., the tax authority will invite him to file it and at the same time instruct him about the consequences in the event of failure to file an SH or subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax authority is entitled under Section 37 of Act No 337 / 1992 Coll. to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for failure to fulfil obligations of a non-monetary nature.</seg>
<seg id="352">The SAO audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of filing an SH, tax entities do not have a sufficient incentive to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to file an SH does not affect the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Under Section 102 (5) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. the tax authority is obliged to check the data in the SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the event of a discrepancy between the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payers with a monthly tax year) or relevant (payers with a quarterly tax year) VAT return, the tax authority should verify the accuracy of the declared tax liability in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">Erroneous data in the SH is removed by the taxpayer himself by filing a subsequent SH, or he may be asked to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax authority shall correct the data on supplies of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system in the event that:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the payer fails to prove the information given in the SH (or subsequent SH) and corrects it by administering a subsequent SH;</seg>
<seg id="359">- the tax authority has proved that the information provided by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH is not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">By inserting a correction without submitting a subsequent SH, the tax authority does not replace the taxpayer's submission, it merely adjusts the data in the VIES database so that it is up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The SH data shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">They can only be sent and received by the national tax authority, designated for cooperation with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Ministry of Finance, the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O _ MCTL is an automatic message that CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Contains all the wrong VAT IDs listed in the sent SH lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the wrong VAT ID is used in one of the transmitted normal SH lines or the subsequent SH, an entry is made in the table of the wrong VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "Notice of Doubt on VAT ID."</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax authority checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is required to declare the VAT and to indicate the values of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of purchased goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return and in the value of delivered goods, as declared by payers from other Member States in their SH, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">The tax authorities have a duty to investigate irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">(A) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant lines of VAT returns is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax authorities will verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">(B) The difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself will submit an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax authorities whether, despite this, they will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">(C) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer stated in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here, too, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After examining the difference and explaining the reasons for it, the tax authority will enter the result of the verification in the ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the screening are transmitted back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005 is shown in Chart 1 (NB: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases referred from CLO to the tax authorities decreased in the quarters of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="383">There was a significant drop in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005. The duty increased the minimum threshold, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error due to the fact that in individual EU Member States some types of transactions may be entered in the SH in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions found at the audited tax offices are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who carry out intra-community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or engage in triangular transactions are required to submit quarterly SH, which lists intra-community deliveries by recipient (Section 18a (1) USTG).</seg>
<seg id="389">Sh must be submitted by the 10th day of the month following the corresponding calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this period is granted in the case of preliminary VAT returns, the same applies to SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">Sh must be supplied by CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">From 1 January 2007, they must be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers are aware that incorrect information is included in the SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers do not file an SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of such a report.</seg>
<seg id="396">This procedure includes: - the first reminder - the second reminder linked to the threat of a fine / periodic penalty payment and - the imposition of a penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows fines of up to EUR 25 000 to be imposed (Section 329 AO), the CLO imposes fines in three steps, amounting to EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) No 5 of the USTG provides that payers are to act unlawfully if, intentionally or negligently, they fail to properly file an SH, file it incomplete, file it on time, or if they fail to correct or correct it late at all.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punishable by a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office, as processing SH is the exclusive task of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">Sh data is only stored in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">The data from SH is therefore only visually available to the tax office after it has been processed into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The time limits for processing SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">SH data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT IDs in the SH of German payers, CLOs from another Member State will receive the O _ MCTL codes.</seg>
<seg id="406">Customs will contact a specific trader and ask him for the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is referred to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to ask for the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the inspection, BRH found that most of the entrepreneurs had corrected the VAT ID at the request of CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, the threat and the imposition of three additional fines takes up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">In 73% of these cases, the Tax Office refused to exempt declared intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file a corrected SH with the CLO, as the tax authorities could not correct the VIES data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor CLO had checked the submission of the corrected SH, so payers often did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, the comparison of the supply data declared in the VAT return and in the SH will not take place before these data are submitted to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually used in the preparation of the VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data collected from other Member States are processed into CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then submitted to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">These data are used for the purposes of the control of acquisitions by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, the CLO checks them against data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is created and sent to the relevant tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is produced at a later stage and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure will then check these data with the data on the intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system fully covers those businesses who do not have the full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State submit SH within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the local tax office.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities process the SH and transfer the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, indicated by the payers in SH, are compared at the tax offices with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State, indicated by those payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to submit quarterly SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Sh payers submit to CLO, from 1 January 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities only have the information from SH after it has been processed into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Payers from the Czech Republic and Germany only mention the supply of goods in SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the wrong lines submitted by SH on their own.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to data from the German VIES system, the faulty VAT ID was not corrected, even though the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FO.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax authorities do not compare the data on intra-Community supplies contained in the VAT return of the German payer and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">The differences between the data of these two statements are not usually detected before the German CLO provides data from VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">In view of the BRH findings, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison is carried out by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are passed on to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in taxpayers' tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not normally control the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is carried out only for taxpayers who do not have the full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax authority controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions by other taxpayers only if the RMS produces a warning or if the payer is designated for inspection anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities from having to explain the reasons for any difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">The fight against carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-Community acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers submit SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, as most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to submit monthly VAT returns - and SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, filing an SH may involve filing a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, an obligation to administer SH monthly would cause more time mismatches between the reporting of intra-community delivery and intra-community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the German Federal Government considered a general provision for monthly SH's.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed due to doubts from the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They were concerned that monthly submissions from VIES to other Member States' CLOs could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the monthly SH submission obligation and the monthly data transmission were to be effective, a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistics on the supply and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In the context of foreign trade, Germany is the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-community transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TINs or VAT IDs contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These figures are set out in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">Level 3 international exchange of information</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-Community commercial transactions and the payers who have carried out such transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218 / 92 distinguishes between two basic categories of exchange of information, namely the exchange of information upon request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information upon request takes the form of so-called "Requests for Information" (hereinafter referred to as "JOI"), using standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax authorities from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI or replies to the received ŽOI via the financial directorates to the CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided on the standardised SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">Customs also ensures the receipt of Rus from other Member States and replies to sent Rus, their translation into Czech and distribution to the local tax authorities for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum time limit of 3 months from receipt of the application for the processing of an EOI.</seg>
<seg id="473">All ŽOI submitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany were audited by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of a total of 94 ŽOI received from Germany in the Czech Republic, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the stipulated three-month period, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were dealt with after this period and the remaining 1 case had not received a reply to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">Chart 2 contains more detailed information on the deadlines by which replies to the ŽOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of a total of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the stipulated three-month deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) requests were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) had not received a reply from Germany by the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining 1 case, it was not possible to determine from the submitted data when the reply from Germany was received).</seg>
<seg id="477">Graph 3 contains more detailed information on the deadlines within which the replies to the ŽOI sent to Germany were received in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage of the values of intra-community transactions reported in ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Graph 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the graph above, the value of the commercial transactions examined through the JOI was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes the form of either automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax administrations from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request which may be of interest to them in the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">The information shall be transmitted electronically between the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange," according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, means the systematic communication of pre-determined information to other Member States, without prior request and at pre-established regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of pre-determined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax authorities from the form Notification of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. and from a copy of the tax document issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">When processing the above form, the tax authority fills in the necessary data in a specially created template and forwards it in turn to a contact officer at the tax directorate, where the data are collected and transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States within a specified deadline, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which the information was available.</seg>
<seg id="489">In addition, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions, which appears to be unjustified, and information on potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="490">That information shall be sent to other Member States by spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information, checked by the BRH, were sent in order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in another Member State, or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the request for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable reason for such a request, the German CLO will reject any request containing an amount below the limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to respond to a request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant tax office with a reference to the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no further deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities when they respond to uncompleted requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audit: A special VAT audit, which covers any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only relate to one business transaction that has been carried out recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and exportable type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has proven its usefulness in investigating individual taxable business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="505">As part of the automatic exchange without prior request, the FRG provides other Member States with information - on VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States, - on input tax refunds to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, the FRG undertook to provide the following information to other Member States through structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">A. the supply of new means of transport to businesses without the use of their VAT ID, b. the sending or catalogue sale in other Member States which is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intra-Community purchases declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. the intra-Community supply of goods which the German payer did not declare in SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. a potential "missing trader" who carried out intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or to those recipients who misused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The sending of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the local tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual form SCAC (Czech - English) and translates the information sent into English and German respectively, the German tax authorities follow the instruction that they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a monolingual form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide for the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">An examination of the ŽOI submitted between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany revealed that the Czech tax administration processed 74.5% of the received applications within the stipulated three-month period, while the ŽOI sent to Germany was processed by the German tax administration within the stipulated period in only 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO draws the attention of the tax authorities to the three-month period, it does not monitor the time periods that have elapsed.</seg>
<seg id="514">The lack of warnings has resulted in a large number of delayed responses to the JOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that CLO be regularly alerted.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information from the German CLO, it is now alerting the tax authorities to respond to the incomplete answers to the JOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, risk management in the area of VAT is handled by several departments at different organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Ministry of Finance, the following services deal with the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Department of VAT Methodology and Performance and within it the report on VAT Risk Management, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends of these risks at both domestic and Community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">It coordinates the functioning of the role of credibility of VAT returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky commodities, processes risk management in the area of VAT conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EU institutions and with other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT, which, inter alia, ensures the exchange of information in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public information and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TINs or VAT IDs contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These figures are set out in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">These differences may be due to different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL messages.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Tax Control and Search Methodology Unit, which, among other things, carries out risk analysis in the framework of the methodological management of tax controls and, in accordance with the risk analysis, sets priorities for the targeting of tax controls in the plans of the financial directorates, carries out risk analyses in the context of the reduction of tax evasion, including the collection of lessons learned from tax administration and other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">In the financial directorates, search departments are set up to carry out, among other things, searches for tax entities and areas that are at risk from the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches for unregistered tax entities from the point of view of the risks of tax evasion (e.g. internet services, job matching, radio and print services, etc.), analysis of links between chain fraud and transmission of information to local and regional tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialised control units are set up at the selected 12 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have a regional remit, they carry out tax checks outside the territorial remit of the tax authorities on the basis of a mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up specialised tax inspection units has emerged as a result of increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur mainly in entities linked to chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with a specific activity and multinational companies and tax entities with a large scale of activity in terms of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms have been integrated into ADIS to reduce VAT risks: - the role of Confidentiality of VAT returns, to assess the risk of tax returns submitted, - the role of Selection of tax entities for inspection, allowing the collection of payers for inspection on the basis of the chosen criteria, - the role of VIES, through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES allows, inter alia: - to check the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States, - to obtain from other Member States the values of goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, - to generate a set of payers who have not submitted SH, - to carry out a formal check of the data submitted by payers from the Czech Republic in SH before sending this data to other Member States, - to generate a set of payers for whom the data on supplies of goods to other Member States in VAT returns do not match the data in SH, - to generate a set of payers for whom the value of purchases of goods from other Member States in VAT returns does not match the data declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their activities to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax authorities have access to registers of government bodies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Register, Business Register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (in particular CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development task forces, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At CLO level, ST I 2 (hereinafter "Kuss" - the coordinating unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a special database called the AACC.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kuss, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has introduced a new database called Zauber, designed to transfer the names of tax evaders' "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="546">Kuss coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of Kuss is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, the specialists of several other departments of CLO and MF are entrusted with the duties and powers associated with RMS.</seg>
<seg id="549">At CLO level, a formal check on the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in SH submitted by German payers is in place.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out before SH data is provided to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Verification of the validity of VAT IDs listed in the SH is carried out on the basis of O _ MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT IDs, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO RMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control reports based on several characteristics that typically feature in so-called carousel trading operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="553">Federal tax authorities are instructed to process these audit reports and, in some cases, to report the results of their CLO findings.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing exclusively on the company's turnover) is to be assumed with sufficient probability.</seg>
<seg id="555">BRH therefore proposed to the Ministry of Finance that different characteristics be taken into account in the processing of the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should also sanction other facts, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour (morality), industry (economic activities) or shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of the RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, RMS generates a list of those taxpayers who have declared intra-Community supplies in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-Community acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">Federal tax administrations try to avoid comparing quarterly data because such a comparison would reveal too much dissenting data that is attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">- the different duration of the intra-community transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">- different accounting for sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing VAT return and VIES data, many Länder have introduced RMS elements based on VAT return data and some other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, number of employees and taxpayer's payment behaviour / morale).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a rules-based RMS that allows a team of tax fraud specialists ("risk managers") to program their own rules to single out potential tax evaders.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">The relevant tax authority will therefore receive a recommendation made by the RMS before VAT is determined.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this RMS is not able to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers have to adjust the relevant rules based on feedback from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The administrative district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data from tax files in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">On the basis of these data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">Once a month, the RMS produces a list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">This list is used by the relevant tax authorities as a basis for deciding on the audit of proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, the auditors have to report on their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The North Rhine-Westphalia administrative region uses an adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on a large number of data from assessed VAT returns and some other facts, this neuron-fuzzy system or system for collecting potentially useful information (the so-called data-mining system) calculates the probability that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then draws up a monthly list of potential fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers to check and report the findings of the check to the Data Processing Centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of one of the three RMS in the other Länder is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">Given that none of the three RMS are based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">It remains to be seen whether this system will deliver the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of the EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - is not proving to be a national problem, but rather a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers engage in fraudulent activities at the same time not only in one Member State, but in several States.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">The VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not affect the Member State of the instigator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">As part of their cooperation on the implementation of parallel audit actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two audit institutions jointly examined the execution of several commercial transactions in respect of which there were doubts as to their execution or irregularities in the way in which payers from both countries declared these commercial transactions in their VAT and SH tax returns respectively.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases concerning commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, the SAO examined the values of intra-community transactions with Germany reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and by SH on the basis of BRH's warnings.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the SAO, BRH examined a total of 23 cases involving commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 through official communication with the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">An examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different registration methods in the EU Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer was to purchase goods worth EUR 60 500 from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">As the Czech payer only declared the purchase of goods with a value equivalent to EUR 29 869, the Czech tax authority sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In its reply to the JOI received from Germany, the German side stated that in the second quarter of 2004 the German payer delivered goods worth EUR 27 381 to the Czech payer, in the third quarter of 2004 it delivered goods worth EUR 31 997 and in the fourth quarter of 2004 it delivered goods worth EUR 10 276.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply also showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been valid since 28.9.2004, but in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued the VAT ID certificate of validity from 1.5.2004, following an additional application by the German payer for a VAT ID certificate.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer made a correction to SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, the Czech payer was involved in the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer, based on an investigation by the tax authority, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax years in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods purchased from other Member States and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax authorities could not clearly determine whether the values of supplies from the aforementioned German supplier were also included.</seg>
<seg id="609">Following a request from the SAO, BRH found that the German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID when he registered, he was only given an identification number for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although in Germany it is usually not possible to assign VAT ID to the payer retroactively, in this case the German tax official in 2006 allocated VAT ID to the aforementioned German payer retroactively as of 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause a delay in the assignment; for example, if the delay was caused by the CLO after the payer's request for VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the trader does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-Community supplies under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other hand, the German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to be able to declare intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these different procedures between Member States, the German CLO allocated the VAT ID retroactively in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authority requested verification of the registration of the German taxpayer for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="618">The VIES indicated the date of registration as 5.3.2005, with the date of 1.10.2004 on the German payer's registration certificate issued by the German tax office, which is locally competent.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a reply received from Germany, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1.10.2004, but that VAT ID had not been provided to it in Germany for organisational reasons until 16.2.2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">When questioned by the local tax authority, the SAO found that the Czech tax authority had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxpayer for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">With this check, the tax office found that the Czech payer included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German payer before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax year of the third quarter of 2004, the tax office charged the tax entity VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">As requested by the SAO, BRH found that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 16 February 2005 when he informed the tax office about his business, which he started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer declared an intra-community acquisition from the Czech Republic worth 160 EUR (approx. 5,000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="626">The Czech payer declared a supply of goods worth 114,615 CZK (3,642 EUR) to the German payer in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="627">When verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax authority found that his registration was valid from 11.11.2004, i.e. after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer submitted an additional DAP for VAT, in which he declared the tax base on transactions carried out in the Czech Republic worth 114,615 CZK (3,642 EUR) and the VAT of 21,777 CZK (692 EUR), which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">When questioned by the local tax office in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had subsequently submitted an application for a retrial of the additional VAT return and submitted as evidence a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax authority verified the validity of the registration of the German payer as part of an international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from Germany showed that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 11.11.2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax authorities in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that the case was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, as the German payer did not obtain VAT ID until 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on that acquisition by claiming a refund of input tax of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, as there would have been no change in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax authorities did not correct the data in Germany's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH also found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in the JOI, had been changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer has also confused the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax authority verified the acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, in which he verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had booked and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not mention his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax authority found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax authority asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German payer's registration certificate so that it could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech tax office assessed the commercial transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany and therefore did not charge the Czech payer additional tax on the commercial transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for an intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the person acquiring the goods from another Member State and must be able to prove that the goods have been transported to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act, it was therefore an intra-community transaction and VAT should be charged in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any event, it is important that the Czech tax authority noticed this transaction because the supply of the machine at the stated value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to reply to the Rus concerning intra-community transactions with a value of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to data from VIES, in the third quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase goods worth EUR 12,561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax authority carried out a tax audit of the tax entity for this tax year.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax authorities to verify the supply of those goods by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods was not recorded in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax authorities rejected the request for evidence - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory reasons were given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax authority did not obtain evidence for the assessment of the tax on the acquired goods, it terminated the tax inspection without finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">At the request of the SAO, BRH found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (§ 22a - e USTG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer declared those supplies in his annual VAT return and in SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was recognised as entitled to exemption from the supply.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of the BRH notification, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the documents needed for the assessment of the tax on purchased goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO's audit found that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5 October 2005 regarding the examination of the value of the goods delivered for the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer declared a supply of goods to the Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in the SH for this period, but the Czech payer only declared a purchase of goods worth EUR 35 314 in the VAT return for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="663">In its reply to the ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the application could not be processed as the operation of the German firm was closed at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">As the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for the tax procedure in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">In 2005, the Czech tax authority, using the SCAC form, requested verification of deliveries of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German taxpayer, made in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that the ŽOI had not received a reply from Germany by the time of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also found, by asking the local tax authority, that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT return supplies of new means of transport for the German payer in the amount of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax authority corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">Following a request from the SAO, BRH found that the German CLO did not, for technical reasons, submit the aforementioned ŽOI to the local tax office for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following BRH's warning, a check was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the cars had been properly taxed and that the cars in question had been sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">According to data from VIES, the Czech payer should have purchased a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">The purchase of these goods was not admitted by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax returns were not submitted by the Czech taxpayer even after calls from the tax authorities, so on 23 May 2005 the tax office charged him VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, CLO drew attention to the abovementioned delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax authority, the tax authority sent ŽOI to Germany regarding the aforementioned supply.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the reply to ŽOI was not received in the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO audit how the Czech tax administration used the information obtained in the international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tax office cancelled the VAT registration of the Czech payer on 23 August 2005 due to a failure to comply with obligations under the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial reply was sent to ŽOI, because the audit carried out by the tax authorities on payers was not completed at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax authority, using the SCAC form, requested an examination of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to a German payer, carried out in the third quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In its reply to ŽOI, the German tax authority stated that it only had an invoice issued by the Czech payer for a supply of EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">At the request of the SAO, BRH found that the audit carried out by the German tax office on the acquirer from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in the tax returns for August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005, the Czech tax authority, using the SCAC form, requested verification of the delivery of cars to the German taxpayer worth EUR 198 167, carried out in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial reply to ŽOI to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the purchase of some cars by the German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that in order to verify the use of excess VAT deductions, the local tax office carried out several local investigations with the Czech supplier, during which it did not find that they had been improperly used.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer had declared in his VAT returns acquisitions of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 during that period and that the check carried out by the German tax office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the values of the intra-Community acquisition of goods declared by the recipient in the tax return and the values declared by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not the time lag or the indication of the incorrect value of the intra-community delivery of goods in SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 35 716 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax authority and did not carry out any activities at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax authority requested, as part of an international exchange of information, to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The reply to the ŽOI received from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the agreed carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer delivered only EUR 21 659 worth of goods.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of the payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">Following the discovery of fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO, by asking the local tax office in the Czech Republic, found that the tax authority, based on the information obtained, assessed the Czech VAT payer on the purchase of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">At the request of the SAO, BRH confirmed that the German supplier only declared the delivery of goods to the Czech payer in the amount of EUR 7 916 after repairs.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected values of the goods and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the adjustment was made.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus, its SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of an international exchange of information, the German tax authority requested, using the SCAC form, to verify the supplies of goods and services carried out in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, during this period the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth a total of EUR 396 126 to the German payer and to provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax authority carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer in order to verify this supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In reply to ŽOI, the Czech tax authority stated that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line, including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">Individual parts of the production line were supplied by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic joined the EU and after 1 May 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for the amounts of EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer accepted the invoices issued, but did not accept them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO also found that all invoices are duly registered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer by asking the local tax authority in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005, only the amounts which were documented by the Czech payer and which relate to invoicing after 1 May 2004 are mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that, on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax office in Germany concluded that the transaction involved the supply of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer, including assembly services.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place where the work was done is where the production line was assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">Under the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the service supplied is liable to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may deduct VAT on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would have been no change in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="719">According to VIES data, in February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine worth EUR 58 000 from German payer C.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax authority has sent a request to Germany for verification of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="721">In its reply to ŽOI, the German side stated that the machine had already been supplied in 2004 by the German payer C to the Czech payer B, who, however, was to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">It also emerged from a reply to a request for information that German payer C had sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organisational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">As the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO, by asking the tax authority of the local payer B, found that according to VIES data, the German payer C delivered goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">Payer B denied the acquisition of the goods, so the local tax authority from the Czech Republic sent ŽOI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the reply to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">A further investigation with payer B found that the machine, worth EUR 88 027, was not in the accounts of payer B and that it could be of the same type as that supplied by the organisational unit of German payer C to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO also found that the Czech tax authority of the locally competent payer A carried out a local investigation of this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax authority had at its disposal an invoice from German payer C dated 7.2.2005, on which payer A was listed as the purchaser of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax authority found that payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Payer A had a lease agreement with another Czech company, where the object of the lease was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9 February 2005 and the transport of the machine was carried out by the leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech Tax Office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C did not deliver the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax authority did not grant the German taxpayer C an exemption from VAT and corrected the information in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German payer D supplied the machine to the Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, BRH found that German payer C had declared in its SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">That supply was not examined during the tax audit carried out by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between the participants in the above transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO found during the audit of the received ŽOI that the Czech tax administration received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which the German tax authority requested verification of an intra-community supply from a German payer worth EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax authority, there was a suspicion that this case was a fake intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">It was also stated in the ŽOI that the German payer had not carried out any active commercial activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax authority carried out a local investigation of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the manager of the Czech company, the above case was apparently a claim by a German payer against the German tax administration, which was filed by the Czech payer as a partner of a German company with the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax authority does not currently have any information that the German tax administration has dealt with the issue related to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the information available, it was not a supply of goods, yet the value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-community supply of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not declare intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to data from VIES, the German payer delivered goods worth a total of EUR 33 205 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. The Czech payer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">ThissegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">As part of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax authority requested verification of the supply of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to that request, the German tax authority stated that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, while the remaining goods had been collected by the Czech payer himself.</seg>
<seg id="757">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that even before receiving a reply to ŽOI, the Czech payer had submitted additional VAT returns for the periods mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in acquisition values have not been resolved, so the Czech tax administration recommended a tax audit of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The inspection has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">According to VIES data, the German payer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, the Czech payer only awarded an intra-community purchase of the equivalent amount of EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax authority requested verification of the value of the supplies made as part of an international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="763">The reply to the ŽOI, received from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated delivery value of EUR 31 999, i.e. the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="764">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that after receiving a reply from Germany, the Czech tax authority contacted the accountant of the Czech payer and agreed with him to discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the third quarter of 2004 with the owner of the company after examining these invoices.</seg>
<seg id="765">An additional VAT return has not yet been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax authority told the SAO that it would proceed in such a way as to comply with the deadlines set for any additional assessment of VAT for the relevant tax year.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German payer was to deliver to the Czech payer goods worth EUR 11 600.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of an international exchange of information, the German tax authority asked for confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed, because the alleged partner of the German payer had set up more fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">During the examination of the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to the Czech payer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted evidence of the sale of the goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not declare or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts suggested tax evasion on the territory of Germany and were communicated by the Czech tax authority to the German tax administration in response to the ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer, on the basis of the investigations carried out, submitted an additional VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of the acquisition of goods from, among others, the German payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct the tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT on the sale of goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax authority assessed the additional VAT return unchanged after a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, this case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax authority therefore made an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax authority, immediately after receiving a reply to the JOI stating that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded EUR 1 600 in VAT from him.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the relevant tax office has sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of the goods is correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, payers reported intra-community transactions that were unlikely to have actually taken place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax authority received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The application was accompanied by a copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech payer for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="786">It was also accompanied by a copy of the passport of the person who, it was said, was to carry out the transport of the car.</seg>
<seg id="787">An investigation by the Czech tax authority found that it was a stolen passport, the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was provided by the Czech tax authority in its reply to ŽOI, along with a statement that it could not confirm the purchase of the goods - the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">When questioned by the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer was not based at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the manager of the company was non-contact.</seg>
<seg id="791">After conducting a complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax year, the Czech tax authority charged the Czech taxpayer a tax liability of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="792">A further investigation by the Czech tax authority found that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity, which had bought it through an advertisement on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech reply to ŽOI, the competent German tax authority would not grant the German taxpayer the right to exemption from VAT on that supply.</seg>
<seg id="794">During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to explain the difference of EUR 3 000 between the value of the goods acquired declared on the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was stated that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth EUR 89 424 to the German payer during the fourth quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax authority requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the context of an international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax authority stated in its reply to ŽOI that the sole manager of the Czech company had been removed from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new manager had not been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods appeared to be related to a partner in a Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer also submitted VAT returns to SH, which after the removal of the manager from the Commercial Register was signed by an unauthorized person - the stated partner of the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer confirmed to the tax authority that the partner of the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic, when questioned by the local tax office, found that the tax authority had recognised the Czech taxpayer's entitlement to VAT exemption for the fourth quarter of 2004 on supplies of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for the first quarter of 2005 in the amount of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax authority in Germany had not corrected the VAT return of the German purchaser because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">As an earlier check did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">According to VIES data, in 2005 a German payer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 after purchasing goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neither in the 2004 tax return nor in the 2005 tax return did the German payer declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, it did not provide adequate supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these differences, the German tax office sent ŽOI for the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported intra-community delivery of goods to the German payer for a total value of 167,246,083 CZK (5,615,299 EUR) in SH for these two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the ŽOI was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the Czech payer had made the declared intra-community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no manager.</seg>
<seg id="812">According to the material provided by the SAO by the competent tax authority, on 30 March 2006 a report was drawn up with the manager of the Czech payer on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and January-December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax authorities to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above periods, but no documents were submitted.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the sole manager of the Czech payer ceased to hold office on 16 May 2006, and a new manager was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has stopped submitting VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the audit, the SAO, in cooperation with BRH, examined, among other things, several cases of intra-community supplies made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases examined was transmitted by the two supreme audit institutions through the CLOs of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">The Czech company (ECR), which is not resident in Germany, has informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (EDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms in the name, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to a lack of own capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relationship and mode of transport of wind farms:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place where these transactions take place must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">- A Danish entrepreneur (EDK) has sent wind farms to be assembled under his name, at his own risk and on his own account in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the assembly of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind turbines is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (EDK) and the transport was carried out under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind farms were shipped to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of a German subcontractor (eD) could not be exempted because another Member State of destination is different from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (ECZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery to the Czech company (ECR) is also determined by the beginning of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind power plants started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The delivery of those wind power plants that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The supply of other wind farms that are produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">Thus, the Czech company (ECR) carried out both intra-community delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (ECR) did not declare any intra-Community acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany, nor did it submit SH to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (ECR) did not report any intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">An examination of the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case does not show any sign of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">In addition, the SAO and BRH examined the transactions to point out the differences between the declaration in the tax return and the VIES data, which were due to the different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in the legislation need time for the implementation of the new legislation by both payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">In the SH for the second to fourth quarters of 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-community supplies to the German payer for a total value of 792 977 452 CZK (25 197 885 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported an intra-community delivery to another German payer for a total value of 18,157,265 CZK (576,970 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers listed the above supplies in the SH in accordance with the text of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., which was in force in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">By further examining the above transactions, a group of auditors of the SAO found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal arrangements for the supply or purchase of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the current version of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll. as an intra-community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-community acquisition, but a taxable transaction with the place of performance of the transaction in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in legal regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635 / 2004 Coll., which amends certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">In addition, when examining selected intra-community transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported in SH for the 1st to 4th quarters of 2005 intra-community delivery to the German payer for a total value of 240,411,163 CZK (8,071,823 EUR) and another Czech payer reported in SH for the same period intra-community delivery to the German payer for a total value of 263,470,776 CZK (8,846,050 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of supply is the place where the customer has his registered office, place of business or where he has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have declared the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that the two payers mentioned above reported the intra-Community supply of electricity in SH distorted the data in VIES by a total of 503,881,939 CZK (16,917,873 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation met the objectives of BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs have acquired a deeper knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that the legislation on VAT management differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">During parallel checks, suspicious cases of intra-community transactions were identified.</seg>
<seg id="857">It makes sense to examine some of them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs made recommendations on VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following controls on the VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in the control of excise administration between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted joint report reports on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky, focused on the administration of excise duties in the period after the accession of the two countries to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was carried out on the basis of a contract for cooperation in control activities concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel checks was chosen in the light of a fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties, which took place in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow goods not subject to tax to circulate until the date of their delivery for final consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under a suspensive regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on the tax authorities and requires close cooperation between the competent administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation on controls of the administration of excise duties for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (Czech Republic) 05 / 34 (SR) 48 / 11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of inspection: (Czech Republic) Administration of Excise Duties (Slovak Republic) Procedure of the collegiate authorities in the administration of spotreble taxes</seg>
<seg id="14">On 8 February 2006, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter "NKÚ-ČR") and the Najvyššší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky (hereinafter "SAO SR") concluded a "Treaty on Cooperation in Audit Activities."</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel inspections of the "Administration of Excise Taxes," included in the NKÚ-ČR audit activity plan for 2005 under No 05 / 34, and "Control of the procedure of the collegiate authorities in the administration of spotreble taxes," included in the audit activity plan of the SAO SR for 2006 under No 48 / 11.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel checks had the character of coordinated checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information that the contracting parties could not obtain during the inspection of the administration of excise duties on the territory of their state and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the inspections within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards - Directive No 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic") was carried out by groups of auditors from the State Budget Department and from the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, South Bohemia, West Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia between 7 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">27 inspectors were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="20">The audited entities were the Directorate-General for Customs (hereinafter referred to as "the GSC") and 11 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="21">Within the framework of the GŘC, 12 selected customs offices out of a total of 54 were inspected.</seg>
<seg id="22">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "SR") was carried out by the financial and tax section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the expositions of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 in the period from 13 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">Eight inspectors were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">The aim of the parallel checks was to examine the customs authorities' handling of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">International cooperation focused on the procedure of tax authorities in the exercise of supervision over the transport of goods subject to excise duties, in particular on the registration of initiated and completed shipments under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise tax authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">2. Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="27">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by the tax authorities until 31 December 2003.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken over by the customs authorities, which have so far only collected excise duty on imports.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="30">The revenue of the state budget from excise duties in the Czech Republic amounted to a total of CZK 82.8 billion in 2004 and excise duties accounted for 19.5% of the revenue of the state budget from taxes and fees amounting to CZK 424.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="32">In 2004, the revenue from excise duty on mineral oils to the state budget amounted to 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it amounted to 90.9%.</seg>
<seg id="33">The difference from 100% in the amount of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of all excise duties in the Slovak Republic has been carried out by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, the administration of which has been carried out since 1 January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">Until then, excise duties had been administered by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products are subject to excise duty in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">The revenue of the state budget from excise duties in the Slovak Republic amounted to a total of Sk 43.4 billion in 2004 and excise duties accounted for 20.7% of the total tax revenue of Sk 209.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties was CZK 50 billion and excise duties accounted for 22.5% of the total tax revenue of CZK 222.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="47">Authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic means the operator of a tax warehouse, the economic operator is the authorised recipient for the repeated or one-off receipt of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="48">The movement of products subject to excise duty under suspension of duty is only possible under Directive 92 / 12 / EEC with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the start of the journey, unless further copies are required by the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch.</seg>

<seg id="68">Until 31 December 2005, the procedure for transporting alcohol and tobacco products from Slovakia to another Member State of the European Union was amended as follows:</seg>
<seg id="69">Pursuant to Article 26 (4) of Law No 105 / 2004 Z. z.</seg>
<seg id="70">"When transporting lieh from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse, or to an authorised recipient, or to a tax beneficiary in an inom member's staff, the odosielatel" (the supplier ") is obliged to send the copy of the first diel of the preparatory document electronically or faxom to the Poprad Colný úrad on the day of the start of the transport; this copy is also required to be sent to the colný úrad by writing to the piatich of working days from the day of the start of the transport."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pursuant to Article 22 (4) of Law No 106 / 2004 Z. z.</seg>
<seg id="72">"When transporting tobacco products from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to a tax warehouse, or to an authorised recipient, or to a tax beneficiary in an inom member's staff, the odosielatel" (the supplier ") is obliged to send the code of the first diel of the sprievodní document electronically or fax to the Colný úrad Poprad on the day of the start of the transport; this code is also required to be sent to the colný úrad písomne najneskor in the piatich working days from the day of the start of the transport."</seg>
<seg id="73">For the transport of other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) during the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 ("the audited period"), the taxpayer was not obliged to notify the Poprad Customs Office or the competent customs office of the start of the transport under suspension of duty.</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax authority only became aware of the transport of these products during a local investigation or during a tax inspection from the accompanying documents and the accounting documents of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="75">The consignor in SR is obliged to draw up the accompanying document in four copies before the start of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="76">Copy No 1 shall be retained by the consignor (when transporting ethyl alcohol and tobacco products, he shall send a copy of copy No 1 electronically or by fax to the Poprad customs office and the competent customs office).</seg>
<seg id="77">Copies Nos 2, 3 and 4 shall accompany the goods being transported.</seg>
<seg id="78">According to the Czech legislation, the consignee in the Czech Republic keeps copy No 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in the Slovak Republic and confirms receipt of the products on copies No 3 and 4.</seg>
<seg id="79">Certified copies Nos 3 and 4 will be sent no later than the first working day after the end of the transport to the local customs office in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="80">Copy No 4 shall be retained by the customs office and copy No 3 shall be returned to the consignee to verify its accuracy and validity.</seg>
<seg id="81">The consignee shall send the certified copy No 3 no later than the following working day after receipt to the consignor in SR.</seg>

<seg id="84">Figure 3 - Circulation of the accompanying document for transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in Slovakia and ended in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="85">In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the conditional exemption procedure is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office of the locally competent consignor before the start of transport.</seg>
<seg id="86">The document proving the end of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products shall be copy No 3 of the accompanying document, certified by the consignee and his competent tax authority.</seg>

<seg id="89">2.3 Registry of initiated and completed shipments conducted by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">A single electronic system is not in place to monitor the movement of goods under suspension of duty between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="91">Decision 1152 / 2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty requires Member States and the European Commission to introduce, from 1 July 2009, an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) to enable excise authorities in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the conditional exemption regime and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products across all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">This system will include the national transport databases of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport started and finished on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Evidence of Selected Products ("EVV").</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of shipments carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can obtain information about the start or end of the transport immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the security of the tax on the products transported provided by the consignor at the time of registration of the end of the transport by the customs office to the consignee responsible for the place.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in the Slovak Republic use a database based on SysNed application software, which ensures the automation of their activities in the administration of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in SysNed's application software, this information is automatically transferred to the "System for Exchange of Excise Data" ("SEED") database.</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and progress of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting between representatives of the NKÚ-ČR and representatives of the SAO SR, at which the specific procedure for cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties was discussed, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">The two sides got to know each other about the excise legislation and the organisation of the excise administration in both states.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in authorising, respectively, the initiation and termination of the transport of products subject to excise duty under the conditional exemption regime and the exchange of information between the excise authorities of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides would: - process the total data on the quantities of products subject to excise duty transported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started during the audited period, - compare the data on the transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 and 2711 and ethyl alcohol - Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 under the suspension regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the course of the checks, the periods examined were extended to include the months of October and November 2005, and the transport of tobacco products under the conditional exemption scheme was also subject to checks during those months.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty which were transported under the suspension arrangement between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of records of shipments of goods under suspension of duty</seg>
<seg id="108">The NKÚ-ČR handed over to the Slovak side a database of shipments completed in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5,876 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO SR handed over to the Czech side a database of shipments completed in the Slovak Republic, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 696 items related to mineral oil, 2,066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The NKÚ-ČR compared the data on shipments listed in the register of started shipments in the Czech Republic with the data on completed shipments registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are presented in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on shipments in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the NKÚ-ČR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which was handed over to it by the SAO SR at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data that could reliably agree individual traffic, and therefore only 63% of the traffic started could be attributed.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual shipments were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. sender, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on shipments started in the Czech Republic and completed in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 were compared by the NKÚ-ČR with a database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which it was possible to clearly assign 93% of the shipments started.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the quantity of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">In most cases, the quantity of alcohol was expressed in litres, which could, however, be converted into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the percentage of alcohol in the database.</seg>
<seg id="118">The quantity of tobacco products was given in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms by type of tobacco product.</seg>
<seg id="119">For shipments initiated in the Czech Republic, the completion of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or for which the quantity of products transported did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">Documents accompanying 487 shipments of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were checked.</seg>
<seg id="121">The inspection of these documents was carried out at the customs offices where the NKÚ-ČR carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="122">For shipments authorised by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested through the GŘC.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 shipments, for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide certified copies No 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products listed on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, data on shipments registered in the Slovak database were transmitted to the Slovak side, which, however, was not included in the database of shipments of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR found 95 shipments in the database of the Slovak Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="126">He requested verification of the remaining 46 shipments from the local customs authorities, which proved their completion with copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of the transport carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of started transport.</seg>
<seg id="128">An examination of these cases revealed:</seg>
<seg id="129">- The Slovak transport database registered 11 shipments of alcohol in a total quantity of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 shipments of alcohol in a total quantity of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The NKÚ-ČR found that it was the transport of taxed products, for which the sender does not need the approval of the tax authority to start.</seg>
<seg id="131">The consignor informed the tax authorities in writing of the start of the transport. The transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents, which are used for the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 shipments of mineral oils, Combined Nomenclature code 2710 11 21, were registered in the Slovak Transport Database for a total volume of 173,000 litres carried out by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The NKÚ-ČR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out the transport of 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without the appropriate authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="134">The taxpayer was in possession of a special authorisation for the receipt and use of exempt products, under which it could only supply untaxed products to the holder of the same authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="135">He did not notify the customs office in the Czech Republic of the start of the shipments and did not provide a tax guarantee of CZK 1,207,680 for the transported products.</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax entity delivered 71,000 litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of SR. Even in these cases, it failed to comply with the legal obligation by not notifying the customs office of the start of the shipments.</seg>
<seg id="137">The consignor in the Czech Republic can start the transport of products put into free circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the start of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="138">A taxpayer purchasing products put into free circulation for tax purposes in another Member State is required to declare the quantity and guarantee the tax before withdrawing them.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649 / 92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also allows the use of a movement document for transport under suspension of duty, but it must be clearly indicated that it is a "simplified accompanying document for tax control purposes (products subject to excise duty)."</seg>
<seg id="141">The same rules on the transport and acceptance of products put into free circulation for tax purposes in another Member State apply in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="142">In those cases, the tax entities transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under a conditional exemption scheme, the 3rd and 4th copies of which were submitted by the recipient to the tax authorities in SR for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in the Slovak Republic registered these shipments in the database of shipments under suspension of tax, as the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the transport database of the Czech customs administration with the transport database of the Slovak customs administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases, the quantity of products transported was reported inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, hectolitres or kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it more difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported;</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of alcohol transported indicated in the invoices did not match the quantity recorded in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices were listed in the databases;</seg>
<seg id="148">- Two shipments of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were registered in the database of the Slovak customs administration in November 2004 for a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol, which were not found in the database of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="151">Until 30 June 2005, Council Directive 77 / 799 / EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums laid down the conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="152">Regulation No 2073 / 2004 entered into force on 1 July 2005, laying down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office which shall liaise with other Member States in the field of excise administration and shall be responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, the "Excise Liaison Office" ("ELO ČR") was established at the GŘC to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">With effect from 1 May 2004, ELO at the Poprad Customs Office carried out tasks related to the management of systems for the control of the movement of excise goods (SEED, ISA, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of ELO are carried out by the ELO department (based in Poprada) of the Excise Duty Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "ELO SR").</seg>
<seg id="157">Under Article 3 (3) of Regulation No 2073 / 2004, the central liaison office is responsible, inter alia, for: - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise ("EWSE"), - requests for verification of the movement of excise goods sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System ("ISA").</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and ISA systems are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073 / 2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">Seed - system for the exchange of information on tax entities trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system is made up of national registers of excise payers and allows tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to determine whether products subject to excise duty are traded by a person authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union are able to obtain confirmation of the information held in that database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Act No 98 / 2004 Z. z., with Section 39 of Act No 104 / 2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No 105 / 2004 Z. z., with Section 40 of Act No 106 / 2004 Z. z., and with Section 39 of Act No 107 / 2004 Z. z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, beneficiaries and tax warehouses - the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data will automatically be transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic usually took place once a month during the audited period, exceptionally more than once a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">The SR Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">Data are transferred to the SEED database in the Czech Republic from the national register, which records all persons authorised to handle products subject to excise duty and issued authorisations to handle such products.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Requests from customs offices to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are only obtained through ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">On the one hand, the transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission regulation and, on the other hand, the transport, which is assessed as a risk by the tax authorities, is considered to be a risky consignment.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information takes two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - to be sent when the limits are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- a warning message - is sent when the transport of goods is assessed as a risk.</seg>
<seg id="176">When assessing the level of risk of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database to send a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the registered office of the consignee does not match), ELO SR will draw up a warning message, which it will send to the ELO of the Member State of the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">In drawing up the reports, the ELO follows the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which, among other things, determine the type and quantity of goods in the appropriate units of measurement for the preparation of information and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">During the audited period, ELO SR sent one warning message to ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information about the start of shipments of products in quantities exceeding the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving transport.</seg>
<seg id="181">If, on the basis of its own analysis, the tax authority in the Czech Republic assesses the shipment as risky, it will prepare a so-called warning message, which it will send to the relevant Member State via ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005, ELO ČR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The ISA - the system for controlling the movement of goods - makes it possible, through requests from the ISA, to control individual movements of products subject to excise duty as well as the control of a specified route of transport between the operators mentioned in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information is based on a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system is used in particular in cases where the consignor receives certified copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requests, for example, a refund of excise duty, and in cases where the information contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">During the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO ČR sent ELO SR 25 requests to the ISA.</seg>
<seg id="188">The customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often checked the data contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantity of products received or dispatched, or whether the consignor of the products mentioned in the accompanying document is entitled to handle products subject to excise duty, unless this could be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="189">The ISA applications received in both countries were forwarded to the customs authorities responsible for the consignee or consignor of the excise products.</seg>
<seg id="190">The customs authorities examined the requested data and notified the result of the investigation via ELO to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the NKÚ-ČR and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic for the initiation and termination of the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between the two states, the registration of these shipments, and to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Comparison of legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic has revealed differences:</seg>
<seg id="194">(A) the procedure followed by tax entities and tax administrations when commencing the transport of products under a conditional exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of products under the conditional exemption regime can only be started by a tax entity in the Czech Republic with the approval of the tax authority, which will allow the start of transport on condition that the transported products have been provided with a tax guarantee equal to the amount of tax due to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The start of the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime in the Slovak Republic is not subject to the authorisation of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, the tax entity was obliged to notify the tax authority of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">It was able to start the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the conditional exemption procedure is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office, which has local jurisdiction over the consignor, before the start of transport;</seg>
<seg id="200">(B) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copies 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax authorities for verification no later than the next working day after the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">Certified copy No 3 must be sent to the consignor no later than the following working day after receiving it from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in SR is obliged to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3, certified by the tax authority and the consignee of the products, no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping this register is not regulated by law in the Czech Republic or in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="206">The customs authorities in both countries record all the data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the movement of goods under suspension of duty between Member States of the European Union, which would allow excise authorities in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the movement of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Decision 1152 / 2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 foresees the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring movements of products subject to excise duty from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of the agreement on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime started in the Slovak Republic and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5,876 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side handed over to the Czech side a database of shipments of products under the conditional exemption regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared the data on shipments listed in the register of shipments started in the Czech Republic with the register of shipments completed in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared data on shipments of goods under the conditional exemption regime started in the Slovak Republic and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">The comparison of data was made more difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not reported uniformly in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute the data on individual shipments in the two registers, the accompanying documents were checked and no violations of the conditional exemption scheme or cases of tax evasion were found.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the basis of the findings of the parallel checks, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the transport register in order to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the movement and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152 / 2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow for the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under suspension of duty within the territory of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="219">Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="220">This report was drawn up in Czech, English and Slovak.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are generally a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It goes without saying, therefore, that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention in this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">An example of this is value added tax (VAT) fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated each year in the European Union (EU).</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as 2005, the participants of the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic ("SAO") and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, "BRH") carried out the first parallel audit action in the field of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not confined to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the steps being taken to address the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAIs therefore decided to further develop their cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of the inspection:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the audit operation was to examine the procedure of the tax authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was also intended to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were designed to compare with established best practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008 and, in the case of factual links, the periods before and after, until the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">A subsequent audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the course of previous parallel checks, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations on the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up carried out was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspected cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also focused, for example, on selected cases of high-risk intra-community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of claims and the implementation of VAT controls on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When inspecting the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors arrived at the following audit findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from the previous review</seg>
<seg id="33">* Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel checks, a comparison of VAT registration systems in the two countries revealed differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different registration methods cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation has been presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218 / 92 ("Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT payers' tax identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also amended common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sai expected EU member states to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of the document, which was agreed by EU Member States in the framework of ECOFIN, does not contain the issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to see this as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">* Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="44">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for submitting recapitulative statements to allow for a more timely examination of the values of intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, and in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit recapitulative statements on a monthly basis was not introduced by the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">* Recommendation 3: Comparing data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to make VIES data more reliable and considering linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a task force to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">* Recommendation 4: Sharing the successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit found that our two Member States have different risk management systems, which have their strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system, which allows the exchange of information within the EU, while BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">In the course of the previous control action, commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or recapitulative statements by taxpayers from both countries were jointly examined.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAIs selected nine cases for follow-up, which included the intra-community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the respective countries have not been completed by the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent audit action verified that most of the tax procedures in relation to the selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany had been concluded and that adequate measures had been taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT assessments or avoidance of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-community transactions carried out by EU payers, which were included in EUROCANET, were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting high-risk taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The participation of Member States in this scheme is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the system if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">Due to the fact that the German tax administration was not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with the German VAT ID were assessed as being at risk.</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the audit operation, the SAO found both cases of normal business transactions and cases with suspicion of involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent conduct related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax authorities have limited possibilities to control risky transactions, especially when it comes to so-called missing traders, and it is difficult for a mere physical examination of documents to prove any fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation arises for tax administrations when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-community carousel trade.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and inconsistencies in transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is reluctant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risky taxpayers, which have so far proved successful for the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">There is a need for communication and exchange of experience between EU Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council has reached political agreement on a proposal for a Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in the use of EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are subject to the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the way in which requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims are handled is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics were not consistent.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the SAIs agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to carry out an analysis on the basis of more detailed statistics to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates to increase recovery rates to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The Sai analysed the legal situation regarding the VAT control of large tax entities ("VDS") in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from tax administrations in the form of a questionnaire on areas considered by the SAI to be essential for the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">It is clear from the responses received that the situation in the two countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases, which is based on a large amount of relevant data (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, data from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2012, it is planned to set up a specialised financial office for the management of the VDS.</seg>
<seg id="96">A similar system does not yet exist in Germany, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT controls in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far focused more on the selection of the individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of these data is based on different components of risk management, which will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Running of the control event in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Department II - the revenue department of the state budget and the regional unions IX. Plzeň, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited persons were: The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 tax authorities (hereinafter also referred to as the "FÚ"): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ in Břeclav, FÚ in Domažlice, FÚ in Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupech nad Vltavou, FÚ in Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava III, FÚ in Písek, FÚ in Plzeň, FÚ in Prague 1, FÚ in Prague 4, FÚ in Prague 8, FÚ in Rakovník, FÚ in Sokolov, FÚ in Tábor, FÚ in Vysoký Mýta, FÚ in Zlín and FÚ in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion of this audit action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Conduct of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the audit service for indirect taxes and the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the following Länder carried out the audit:</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following tax authorities have been included: - Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Munich Central Tax Office), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; - Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the tax authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and with the financial directorates of Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">As part of the preparation of the parallel control actions, a meeting of representatives of the two control institutions took place in September 2008 to discuss and define control topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">Subsequently, in December 2008, the leaders of the two SAIs signed a cooperation agreement on the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The inspection teams exchanged the findings gathered so far and agreed on a timetable for drawing up a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAIs, when carrying out parallel control actions, decided to focus on: A follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, a review of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not resolved during the previous parallel check, a review of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were classified as high risk cases, a review of the procedure of tax administrations in the area of international assistance in the recovery of VAT claims, a review of the tax controls of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous review</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">On the basis of the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended the modification of the conditions for VAT registration and the introduction of a new rule for de-registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not make use of the right to cancel the VAT registration of taxpayers who did not comply with the obligations under Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax ("the VAT Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed an amendment to the provision to introduce an obligation for tax authorities to cancel VAT registration for taxpayers when they repeatedly fail to submit VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="128">Under the VAT Act, the tax authority can revoke the registration of the taxpayer "ex officio" in cases where: (A) the payer has not performed a transaction without notifying the tax authority for twelve consecutive months, (b) the payer has failed to fulfil his obligations under this Act, (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In a previous inspection, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the FÚ for Prague 1 to cancel the registration for VAT on 31 January of the following calendar year for so-called non-established taxpayers who did not incur any obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FÚ pro Prahu 1 often did not cancel the VAT registration of these payers, as the relevant provision set an insufficient deadline for the cancellation of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was solved by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax authority is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-established taxpayer if the taxpayer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="135">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for submitting summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure has been implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">Payers must also submit a recapitulative statement if the services for which the place of supply is determined in accordance with Section 9 (1) of the VAT Act are supplied to another Member State to a taxable person registered in another Member State and if the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the tax on those services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in order to make VIES data more reliable This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration compares data on intra-community transactions reported in VAT returns and summary reports of Czech payers automatically in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing the successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore an area of priority and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is evidenced, among other things, by the findings of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the amount of VAT actually collected and justified in the 25 EU Member States ("EU-25") during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">On the basis of an analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated loss of VAT not collected over this period is between EUR 90 billion and EUR 113 billion, with an average of 12% of eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the context of international cooperation, a previous control action found that an effective risk management system could not be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system, which is used for the exchange of information in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-community transactions carried out by EU taxpayers, included in EUROCANET, were selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and improving the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities in a way that allows fraud to be detected in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later also become an important source of information in the risk assessment of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council already approved the creation of EUROFISC on 7 October 200812, setting out the basic principles that will guide it.</seg>
<seg id="157">The image of EUROFISC is the already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report revealed the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised across the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax authorities have set up a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers, which is based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance notified the Commission of the scheme in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improvements to the system shall be made on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">At present, the data from the questionnaire are processed electronically and will then be used for the survey as part of risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="172">A law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted on 8 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="173">This law contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of summary reports on intra-community deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to make VIES data more reliable and to consider linking the two VAT return and recapitulative statement systems</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group composed of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance has been set up.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">The working group also looked at a tool designed to optimise the control process for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a participant in this exchange in the framework of the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and, following a written consultation on 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics, such as:</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports on the results of the work of these sub-groups were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the withdrawal of VAT registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including the database of VAT payers' tax identification numbers.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">For the time being, the issue of registration and deregistration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political consensus on the proposed Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States are required to implement national procedures and are only required to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission has not been able to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and de-registration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore like the Commission to make further efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="201">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a one-month deadline for submitting recapitulative statements, allowing for a more timely examination of the values of intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions reduces the reporting period for intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, and in Germany it took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit recapitulative statements on a monthly basis according to a set calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to make VIES data more reliable and consider linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing the successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system, which is used for the exchange of information in the EU (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this area, BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In a previous audit operation, the execution of commercial transactions for which there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the way in which payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT returns or recapitulative statements was jointly examined.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected for follow-up nine cases involving the intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the control of which carried out by the tax administrations of the two countries was not completed during the previous joint audit action.</seg>
<seg id="215">(1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, the Czech payer purchased goods worth €22,686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return because the German payer was not assigned a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798 / 2003, the Czech tax authority received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be assigned a VAT ID in order for the intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that on the basis of an audit carried out by the Czech tax authority, the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return in which he declared the acquisition of goods of the stated value and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT of the same amount in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">(2)</seg>
<seg id="221">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase goods worth EUR 12,561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and he did not mention it in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax authorities refused to cooperate on request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 because the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax authority did not obtain evidence, it terminated the inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax authority had received two spontaneous pieces of information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in the regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">(3)</seg>
<seg id="228">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods in question was not declared by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax authority assessed the VAT for that quarter at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax authorities requested the payer to submit an additional VAT return, which was not submitted by the payer.</seg>
<seg id="232">A subsequent check revealed that the tax authority had carried out further acts in the tax procedure in 2007, which showed that the passenger car in question had been sold by the Czech payer to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax authority issued a notice of payment for the December 2004 tax year, by which it subsequently assessed VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was liquidated and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of enforcement of the taxable assets of the tax debtor, the arrears appear to be irrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="236">(4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was to deliver new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany during the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 for a total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">A reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 revealed that the German entity was the subject of pending tax and criminal proceedings in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">During a subsequent check, BRH received information that, following the conclusion of tax proceedings in Germany, it had been established that the German taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intra-Community acquisitions of goods were taxed at a value of EUR 182 424 (2004) and EUR 369 690 (2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO's subsequent audit found that the Czech payer was involved in the carousel business with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the examination of the supply of goods, a VAT check was initiated with the Czech tax entity for the tax years April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the inspection findings and information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information, the tax authorities subsequently assessed VAT for the period May 2005 at CZK 703 031 and for the period June 2005 at CZK 726 551.</seg>
<seg id="244">(5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech payer A was to purchase a machine from a German payer for a total value of EUR 58 000.</seg>
<seg id="246">The German payer was to deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004, but payer B denied this purchase of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="247">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that payer B had purchased the machine from a German company which had an organisational unit in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech payer A did not declare the acquisition of goods from the German payer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">A reply from the German tax authority to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 showed that the German payer did not carry out an intra-community supply of machinery worth EUR 58 000, but a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">Following a subsequent inspection, BRH found that, following a tax inspection, the intra-Community supply of the machine had been reclassified as a supply of the machine within the country and the VAT exemption had been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">(6)</seg>
<seg id="252">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer was to deliver €11,600 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and then sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO's subsequent audit found that the Czech tax administration had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, which wrongly stated the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods with the stated value.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German tax authority had corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and subsequently assessed VAT worth EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The German payer's recapitulative statement has not yet been corrected, as corrections to recapitulative statements in Germany can only be made by the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="258">(7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax authority received a request from the German tax administration for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 as to whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">Following the tax procedure carried out for the February 2005 tax year, the Czech tax authority charged the Czech taxpayer a tax liability of CZK 0 and informed the German tax authority that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for failure to fulfil obligations and the Czech tax administration sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">Following a subsequent check, BRH found that the German payer had changed his registered office and that the new local tax authority had cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the car in question to the Czech taxpayer following an inspection.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the data in the recapitulative statement and has lodged an appeal against the decision of the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="264">(8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to VIES data, the German taxpayer supplied goods worth a total of EUR 33 205 to the Czech taxpayer between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax authority was trying to determine the causes of the differences between the Czech tax payer and the purchase of goods between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer has repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax authority did not clarify the difference in the value of the purchased goods in the amount of CZK 134,273 for the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005 because, according to the Czech tax authority, it was not possible to accurately capture the business transactions for each quarter and therefore the tax authority accepted the additional tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="269">(9)</seg>
<seg id="270">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="271">During the same period, the Czech payer awarded the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax authority verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods of EUR 31 998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data provided in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return for the tax year July 2004 only in January 2007, after many urges from the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="275">At the same time, in that tax return, the taxpayer exercised the right to deduct VAT, which left the tax liability for that tax year unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">A follow-up check verified that in selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax procedures had been completed and that the tax authorities in both the Czech Republic and Germany had taken adequate measures (i.e. subsequently assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Checking selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of the inspection in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">Eurocanet can be an important source of information for the detection of risk actors within the Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with the data of the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting in the first quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending data to EUROCANET on risky transactions and on tax entities acting as suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="282">In the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="283">They acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States have been captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax authorities did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help to establish whether suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed by the German tax authorities as being at risk.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where applicable, the tax authorities have used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">The tax authorities did not detect any suspicion of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The tax authorities monitor such tax entities on an ongoing basis for their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the submitted accounts, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed business relations with suspected or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">The verification of commercial transactions was complicated because some taxpayers did not cooperate with tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">For the most part, the local tax authorities examined risky tax entities and risky transactions identified in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax authorities have limited options when examining risky transactions, especially in connection with the screening of so-called missing traders, and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to a tax entity from a physical check of documents alone.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter VAT registration requirements for taxpayers and more flexible deregistration would help reduce missing-trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered in order to report fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to taxpayers who improperly draw input VAT deductions on the basis of them.</seg>
<seg id="297">Greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities should be ensured in cases where tax entities are suspected of being involved in carousel transactions and other fraud, and goods are imported and exported from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help to identify goods and inconsistencies in transport documentation, as well as to monitor the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of EUROFISC, which should be addressed by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Tax Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">That information was the criterion for the collection of the six files of German taxpayers for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, has refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result, Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this position is contained in the following statement: .In the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis for breaching the applicable rules on tax confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such EUROCANET data is used by other Member States. "17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has carried out analyses of EUROCANET data and forwarded them to the tax authorities of the Länder in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive audit information on the direct business relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationships with traders from other Member States who also have business relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to take part.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the EU has reached political agreement on a proposal for a regulation, the main benefit of which lies in the establishment of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained from the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the envisaged VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, the cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that a discussion between Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions appears to be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for debt recovery</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following directives are the basic rules for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>
<seg id="324">Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">(1) Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC was implemented by Act No 252 / 2000 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it was necessary to implement this directive in the Czech legal order and at the same time to amend the aforementioned Act No 252 / 2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No. 191 / 2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28.11.2008 is a new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annex to the Regulation sets out new models of requests, which have been in use since 1.1.2009, introduces an obligation for electronic communication and an obligation for the applicant authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Guiding principles for the provision of international cooperation in debt recovery:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance is always granted only on the basis of an application containing the prescribed particulars;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. the assistance does not cover financial claims which are in the nature of criminal sanctions in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. the provision of international assistance for the recovery of claims shall be carried out in accordance with the national law of the State which has been requested to provide assistance;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims do not have priority in recovery;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance shall be granted only for the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has, without success, made use of all the possibilities available to it to recover the claim under its legal system).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No 191 / 2004 Coll. defines the three forms by which assistance takes place, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The locally competent tax office will electronically send a request for information, a request for service or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance will arrange for the translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it, including annexes, and send it via the CCN / CSI network to the competent authority of the tax administration of the designated state.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two basic requirements for recovery: The claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and not more than 5 years old.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">Upon receipt of a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the request as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it will inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection of the request and specify the specific provisions of the directive on which it relies.</seg>
<seg id="349">This notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application has all the elements according to the law and should immediately forward the application through the Finance Directorate to the local tax office for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax authorities will, among other things, examine the debtor's assets, e.g. by obtaining land registry statements, checking bank accounts, verifying the registration of vehicles at the transport inspectorate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">Six months after the date on which receipt of the request was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out in order to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities, where recovery is not possible, the applicant authority should also be informed of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any amount recovered by the tax authorities shall be transferred to the applicant authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not impossible for the Czech tax authority enforcing foreign claims to allow it to wait until it has been paid or paid in instalments, if the state that requested the recovery gives its consent.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the period of recovery, the debtor is prescribed interest or periodic penalty payments under Act No. 337 / 1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty payment is due to the State that requested the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not send requests to the local tax authorities in time, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the framework of international debt recovery assistance in the case of requests received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191 / 2004 Coll., because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date on which the receipt of the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 (4) of Act No 191 / 2004 Coll. the Czech Ministry of Finance processes statistical data for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, service or recovery sent or received in the past year, indicating the amount of claims to which the requests relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">The European Commission is preparing a report on the state of recovery on the basis of documents provided by all EU Member States, which it will submit to the EU Council and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the item of receivables recovered in 2008 by EUR 5 250 thousand by indicating the incorrect value of the receivable for VAT (this was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the receivable from Czech crowns to the value in euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">This error was subsequently reflected in the European Commission statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance, including recoveries, is provided in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International debt recovery assistance in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal authorisation for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from European Community law, Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to make the wording more accessible and easier to understand, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the Act (EC) on the collection of state taxes of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">Enforcement procedures in Germany are governed by the German Fiscal Code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities can provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities, which are valid in national jurisdiction, and on the basis of the EC Act on Administrative Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) enshrines the statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative tasks of the tax authorities are mainly governed by instructions for execution and instructions for enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance has reached an agreement with representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance in the assessment of taxes and has transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general prerequisites for applying for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">The legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">* All available domestic means of recovery have already been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">The claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.</seg>
<seg id="382">No more than five years may elapse between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. it is no longer subject to appeal) and the date on which the applications are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="383">The total amount of the claim must be more than €1,500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending recovery requests to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for the recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the competent foreign office, such as the Czech CLO, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">The Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 is currently being revised by a working group of the federal and provincial governments to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The application, including the annexes, shall be submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate office.</seg>
<seg id="388">This office will check the accuracy of the application in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the application is not correct, it is returned to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it meets all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then provide the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and will also provide a translation of the application.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receiving recovery requests from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery received from other Member States are registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and a receipt is sent within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check whether the formal requirements have been met.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediary office, which then forwards them to the competent tax authorities and monitors their processing.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If it takes more than six months to process the application, the intermediary authority shall request the submission of a preliminary report to be submitted pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">Once the formal and factual elements of the application have been checked, the implementing services shall notify the method of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any sums recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the application within one month of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008) is contained in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Recovery control, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">In the framework of international cooperation, 21 requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="404">An examination of ten selected cases revealed, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of a VAT claim for 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, or CZK 109 820, from a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax authorities until 26 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax authority established a lien on real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since it was not possible to pay the entire enforced claim by mortgaging the real estate, a payment plan was agreed with the Czech tax entity with payments of at least CZK 2,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, information on the state of recovery was sent to the German tax administration with the result that, as of 25 August 2009, the claim had been partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49 600.</seg>
<seg id="411">This amount was sent to Germany and a further instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany on 28 August 2009.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax arrears from a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 180 869 in Germany, i.e. CZK 4 434 915, in VAT and in income tax and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the tax authorities until 27 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">By examining the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable property, the tax authority found that the debtor did not own any executable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">In addition, a local investigation found that the debtor did not stay at his permanent address for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the reply of the tax authorities was sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery concerning tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3 139, or CZK 84 846.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax authorities on 6 August 2008, although on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax authorities that the request for recovery was being processed by the payment of a claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also recovered in the Czech Republic and paid to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to long time periods in which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorised tax authorities, in this case the claim was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and by the recovery of the claim by the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against a claim from a further request for recovery of EUR 6 649, which was due to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance only records a request for recovery of EUR 3 139 from this company, and a request for recovery of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance with the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of tax arrears from a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 39 957, or CZK 956 654, in income tax and VAT and accessories in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1 June 2009, the procedure for recovery of the claim was initiated, an execution was ordered for ordering a claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and for a deduction from wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7,000).</seg>
<seg id="431">In a meeting with the tax authority, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it to be disputed.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax authority found that in the past the tax entity was willing to pay EUR 250 per month, which was not accepted by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer has promised to discuss the application with the German tax authorities with a view to obtaining a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery of the claim was still ongoing during the SAO audit mission.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity which owed a total of EUR 113 444, or CZK 3 116 304, in income tax for 2005 and in turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the FÚ pro Prahu 1, which is responsible for administering the tax to non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, as it was not possible to determine the local tax authority based on the address of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="438">During the investigation carried out, the FÚ received information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FÚ could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit a request for recovery until after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax authority initiated the recovery of the claim and issued an enforcement order ordering the claim on the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit cooperatives.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery of the claim was still ongoing during the SAO audit mission.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax authority requested international cooperation in the recovery of VAT claims and costs totalling CZK 146,223,742 on 3 October 2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent this request for recovery to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the German tax authority transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Federal Bank, the amount obtained from the execution of funds in the debtor's account, amounting to EUR 17 700, or CZK 439 226.</seg>
<seg id="445">An error was found in the calculation of the amount recovered during the verification of the volume of recoveries.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recovered amount of CZK 146 223 742 was erroneously converted at the rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 to EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct recalculation of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781.83.</seg>
<seg id="448">A request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was reduced by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover the tax arrears from the Czech tax entity, which owed CZK 1,970,632, or EUR 79,847, in VAT and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax administration until 10 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4 February 2009, the German tax authorities asked the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant decrease in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: EUR 4 600 on 8.4.2009, EUR 3 000 on 6.5.2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16.6.2009.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to the account of the tax authorities in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the German tax authorities agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">The request for recovery of a total amount of EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including a claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech tax authority to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax authorities justified the refund on the grounds that the transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) or (h) of Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax authorities also stated that Article 2 (g) concerns claims relating to income tax and wealth tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and capital listed in Article 1 (3) in conjunction with Article 1 (4) of Council Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to prepare and submit a new request for recovery, excluding the arrears in real estate transfer tax in the amount of CZK 61,759 and indicating the arrears in VAT, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be sent back to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax authority to recover tax arrears relating to the same tax entity, which owes CZK 7,079,735 in income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears from a Czech tax entity that owed CZK 3,445,782, or EUR 123,328, in personal income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of this amount, VAT amounted to CZK 1,133,967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the German tax administration until 18 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax authority the reply of the German tax administration from 9 July 2007 to 11 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax authority had issued an enforcement order on 11.6.2007 for a bank account with the bank, which stated, however, that it did not have any business relations with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">In doing so, the German tax authorities considered the application to be complete.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, or EUR 43 591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The request from the Czech tax authorities was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">On 15 December 2005, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax authority executed the execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and a deduction from wages and established a lien on the immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">A reply to a request for information received by the Czech tax authority on 16 September 2005 showed that the Czech taxpayer was staying in Germany and had an income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activities.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20.4.2006, but did not send it to the Czech tax authority until 12.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The reply stated that no enforcement proceedings could be initiated in Germany due to the insolvency of the debtor - no assets were found in his possession and his non-business income was already subject to other enforcement proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="481">In doing so, the German tax authorities considered the request for recovery to be complete.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are subject to the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the way in which requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims are handled is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics were not consistent.</seg>
<seg id="487">In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay particular attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In a 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of statistical mismatches had decreased despite an increase in the number of applications.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important for statistical issues to be discussed again at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should show the annual number of claims as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of claims recovered by each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States, as this can help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that recovery rates can be calculated on a country-by-country basis is considered useful by both SAIs for Member States with lower recovery rates to step up their efforts to improve recovery rates at least to the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should be actively involved in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery of claims to the local tax authorities in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191 / 2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Claims, because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months of the date on which the receipt of the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for the control of the VDS is based on Act No 337 / 1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the tax year stated in the personal / corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="504">The classification of the tax entity as a VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A taxpayer ceases to be referred to as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax years from the end of the period in which it filed the tax return on the basis of which it was classified as a VDS, its net turnover for the tax year has fallen below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">The taxpayer was not allowed to be removed from the VDS register without carrying out a tax audit of at least one tax per tax year.</seg>
<seg id="507">By the end of 2009, all VDS had been checked at least five years apart.</seg>
<seg id="508">From 2010, a written assessment of the tax entity must be carried out at least once every 2 years and the subsequent procedure chosen must eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The control of the FÚ is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administration usually elects several tax years at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The VDCs were controlled by specialised inspection units, which are set up in a total of 13 FTAs, or by the staff of the control departments of the locally competent FTAs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The specialised control unit carries out tax checks within the remit set by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">(A) tax entities operating in unusual and specific business sectors;</seg>
<seg id="514">(A) entities for which carrying out a tax audit is technically and time consuming;</seg>
<seg id="515">(A) entities with a broad territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">(A) entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">* Entities linked in chains and networks that are suspected of widespread tax evasion and the unjustified diversion of excess deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax checks carried out by the specialised inspection units of the FO and the results of these checks are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No 531 / 1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Bodies, which consists of the establishment of a specialised FÚ with a nationwide remit for selected tax entities (including for legal entities established for business purposes, which have achieved a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT controls on large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: The German Fiscal Code (AO), the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), the Tax Control Regulations (BPO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory provisions relating to the inspection are laid down in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax inspection on the spot. In particular, these articles lay down the rules on the admissibility of tax inspection on the spot (i.e. on the premises of the company), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules on the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of control, the obligation of the tax entity to cooperate and the preconditions for carrying out the final discussion and communication of the inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax checks are carried out by the competent tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">The Fiscal Administration Act According to Article 5.1 (1), in connection with Article 19 of the Act, participation in on-the-spot tax checks carried out by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The participating authorities shall agree on the spot on the nature and extent of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in the tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require the specific undertakings it selects to be inspected at a time to be determined by it.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case, it may lay down rules on the conduct and content of inspections at the premises of those companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Rules on tax controls According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the rules on tax controls (German acronym BPO 2000) have been agreed by the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament, in which the governments of the Länder are represented.</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative rules apply to on-the-spot checks carried out both by the tax authorities of the Länder and by the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Undertakings are classified according to size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BPO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to ex post control (Article 4.2 BPO).</seg>
<seg id="535">According to Article 33.1 of the BPO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BPO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration is set out in the following guidelines:</seg>
<seg id="538">A single manual for special VAT controls in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="539">The USLO Manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of data on intra-community trade relations conducted in VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">The Zauber Manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of the Zauber database;</seg>
<seg id="541">Work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits depending on the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to be inspected - not just large companies - must be determined at regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">As a general rule, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually announced, including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that, in the course of the inspection, checks will be carried out definitively, mainly on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks may be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisation of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax years covered by the checks is usually between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BPO 2000 foresees an inspection period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes of the company are subject to verification.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to investigate individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues in order to gain an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT checks on VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they collected information from tax administrations on areas they consider essential for managing the issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">* What statistical records and analyses are available to the management of tax administrations regarding the VAT control of the VDS?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">Are there any statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against VAT fraud and VAT control in general?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such a resolution in the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration makes no distinction between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general control of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="562">Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of VAT checks (linked to the time period of the transactions checked)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Records on the timeliness of enquiries relevant to intra-Community purchases of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, the information recorded in ADIS also includes data such as how long the interview took.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average time of the last inspection (information on the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the selected control periods with regard to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the statistics produced at the federal level for the special VAT inspection services do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are some statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenue generated, broken down for example according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">I. a net increase in the tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer has improperly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">II. only a nominal increase in the tax liability (e.g. transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);</seg>
<seg id="572">III. post-clearance recovery of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of additional tax assessed, broken down by type of tax, the number of tax entities audited and the number of tax years audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigations, complaints) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">The time data and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">General debt statistics shall also be kept, broken down by type of tax but not by the declared tax or the tax established by the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and for the special VAT inspection services do not distinguish between the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">In addition, the majority of tax administrations visited do not distinguish between these differences.</seg>
<seg id="580">Are there areas of control that generate significant additional revenue?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax authority has the right to collect the tax payer for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in the special sections of ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level do not provide such data for tax inspectors and for the special VAT inspection services.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach between the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the Zauber database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder are required to record the increased tax (VAT) liability they have assessed if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, it must specify, for example, the nature of the increase in the tax liability assessed.</seg>
<seg id="587">What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDCs exercise an unjustified right to deduct input tax on supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">(A) which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to Section 72 (1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">(A) which have been used for representation under Section 75 (3) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">On the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Section 21 (1) of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It has been noted that there are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It follows that uniform statistics at federal level do not provide such data for tax inspectors and for the special VAT inspection services.</seg>
<seg id="596">VAT findings are not separately registered by the Länder if they result from VDS tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the Zauber database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder are required to record the increased tax (VAT) liability they have assessed if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">Does the tax administration carry out analyses of areas of control that generate a high "return" and draw conclusions for management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching national audits focused on risky commodities or on the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT inspection services do not provide data on audit areas that generate high "revenue."</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the process of analysis, as well as on case management in terms of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">The differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a number of data from the tax checks carried out, as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheet and profit and loss accounts.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the establishment of a specialised financial office for the management of the VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax authorities do not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">It follows that it is more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar manner.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy puts more emphasis on selecting individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">Therefore, the risk management components will be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help to reduce shortfalls in VAT revenue.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the revenue from VAT collection will be increased and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will be improved.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two SAIs on parallel audits of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">The two SAIs got to know each other better about the systems in place in the following areas: (I) intra-community transactions, (ii) VAT risk management, in particular as regards the collection of risk-prone transactions, (iii) VAT recovery assistance and (iii) VAT control of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies as well as differences in the above-mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany have been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings were compared and best practices were identified.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to start a discussion on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation between the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="626">Closing date: June 2010.</seg>
