<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The material submitted informs the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's Supervisory Authority, which focused on the field of value added tax management and the use of the VIES information system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) on value added tax).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the European Union budget as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel control actions focused mainly on the control of the tax administrators procedure when checking the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the VIES system enabled an electronic exchange of information on the registration of value added tax payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by these payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inconsistency between VIES data and the data in the value added tax return submitted by the payer should draw the attention of the tax manager to suspicious cases and allow tax evasion to be detected or. scams.</seg>
<seg id="8">The contribution of parallel checks carried out consisted not only in exchange of information on the financial or financial procedure. the tax authorities in the management of value added tax, but especially in the verification of the use of VIES in checking the application of value added tax exemption in intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained during the implementation of parallel checks is a benefit for the development of cooperation between them and will be used in carrying out further parallel checks in cooperation with the control institutions of Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel Value Added Tax Administration checks for the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of inspection: (CZ) Value added tax management, (SK) Control of the tax authority's procedure for the management, control and enforcement of value added tax and performance of tasks within the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ, the Czech Republic ′′) and the Slovak Republic's Najvyšší SR (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ SR ′′) concluded a cooperation agreement in the control activity on 12. August 2005</seg>

", included in the control plan of the NKÚ SR under No. 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel control actions performed were the character of coordinated checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated inspection was processed within the meaning of the European Implementing Regulation No. 31 for INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information within the scope of the contract concluded and drawing up a joint final report on the result of parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of a coordinated inspection was to verify selected delivery and acquisition cases in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the ′′ SR ′′).</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties contractually committed to each other to provide information from public sources, VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on accepted and sent requests to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the department of the state budget and territorial unions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Ministry of Finance and 12 financial authorities were controlled by the Ministry of Finance and 12 financial authorities: the IRS in Mladá Boleslav, the Finance Office in Kolín, the Finance Office in Teplice, the Finance Office in Karlovy Vary, the Finance Office in Tábor, the Finance Office in Brno III, the Financial Office in Znojmo, the Financial Office in Znojmo Office in Zlín, Finance office in Šumperku, Ostrava I, Finance office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The inspection in the territory of the SR was carried out by the financial and tax section of the NKÚ SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Bratislava I tax office, Komárno tax office, Trenčín tax office, Prievidza tax office, Tax office Elected, Dolný Kubín tax office, Košice II tax office, Košice V tax office and Michalovka tax office.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of checks:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of parallel control actions was to examine the progress of financial and / or financial. tax authorities in the management of value added tax (VAT) after the inclusion of the Czech Republic and the SR into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the EU) and verify the use of the VIES electronic information system, especially when checking the application of the VAT exemption claim I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="27">The controlled period of coordinated inspection was the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions In EU Member States, an electronic VIES system is in place, allowing tax administrators to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and in the country of destination it allows the customer to check whether the acquired goods have been properly admitted and taxed.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES system is not centralized within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inspection revealed different variations of national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and SR in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">Summary reports indicate the values of delivery of goods to other EU Member States, the values of services provided are not included in the summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from summary reports submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the financial authorities where they compare with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States given in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The financial authorities transmit data from summary reports to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In SR, data from summary reports submitted by Slovak tax payers are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the SR Tax Directorate (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers show the value of supplying goods and the value of providing services to other EU Member States on separate lines of tax returns for VAT, which allows comparing the values given in the summary reports with the value of the supply of goods according to VAT tax returns and identifying their differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, the values of the goods supplied and services provided to other EU Member States are reported summarily on the common line of VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, the SR system does not automatically identify the differences between the value of the supply of goods according to VAT returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the value of supplies of goods in VAT tax returns allows you to use the results of comparison of data when checking the exemption of goods to the EU from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="39">The data delivered from summary reports submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed into CLO and compared with the value of acquisition of goods given by the payer from the Czech Republic or. SR in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In SR, these data are sent to tax authorities and tax administrators will decide which cases of differences will check.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) will determine which quantified differences between the value of delivery and acquisition of goods must be checked by the tax administrators and transmit a list of such cases to the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that the most significant variations will be verified whether VAT has been granted to the right amount of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">The inspection further highlighted some problems in the VAT management system complications caused by different reporting of intracommunitary transactions (i.e. delivery and acquisition of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summary reports are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">A shortening of the period for which summary reports are submitted to one month, together with a shortening of the deadline for processing them, would allow earlier access to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">Tax administrators could thus verify more effectively whether VAT was awarded to the correct amount of intracommunitary acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, filing tax returns and summary reports for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer reported the same value of the delivery of goods to the EU in the summary report and VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">Differences between the values of supply of goods declared by EU payers and the values of acquisition of goods declared by the payers from the Czech Republic or. SR was caused by MJ. different reporting of intracommunitary supply and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">For example, it was the introduction of advances received into summary reports, or the reporting of intracommunitary deliveries in a summary report of the supplier in a different quarter than intracommunitary acquisitions in the tax return to the customer's VAT.</seg>
<seg id="50">Unification of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlined monitoring activity of the Member State s' tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of NKU, Czech Republic and NKU SR was also focused on the examination of selected intracommunitary transactions between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="52">A total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined together, where there were doubts about their effectiveness or. suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="53">NKÚ, Czech Republic and NKÚ SR found out, among others. the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities have reported in their VAT tax returns for the purpose of unauthorized tax deduction of excessive VAT transactions, which were not actually implemented;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax operators showed intracommunitary delivery within the carousel shops, which caused a deliberate reduction in the value of deliveries to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers reported in their tax returns for VAT and summary reports intracommunitary supply of VAT exempt goods to buyers who were so-called. ' lost company s' and tax on goods acquired;</seg>
<seg id="57">suppliers carried out an intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT for tax entities not registered in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In these cases the VAT supply should not have been exempted and should have been taxed in the country of the supplier;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers reported intracommunitary delivery at higher value in their VAT tax returns than the intracommunitary acquisition, in some cases VAT was incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="60">The knowledge gained in the control action showed that VIES provides tax administrators with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrators should pay increased attention especially to the thorough examination of the differences between VAT payers and VIES data and the use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>

<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of parallel control events, a coordination meeting of representatives of NKU, Czech Republic with representatives of NKU SR took place in the first half of July 2005</seg>
<seg id="225">Participants of this meeting acquainted with VAT legislation in both states and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The outcome of the negotiations was a specification of the scope of cooperation and the conditions for the selection of control samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">The two parties agreed that cooperation will focus on the following areas: (a) validation and correctness of VAT registered persons in the Czech Republic or. SR during intracommunitary delivery; (b) verification of data on intracommunitary acquisitions specified in DAP payer in Czech Republic using information from summary reports (SH) of SR payers contained in VIES system and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in Czech Republic and in SR about business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="228">It was also agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out following the volume of intracommunitary supplies between the Czech Republic and SR and according to the number of applications for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the SR via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure for processing information by tax administrations of the Czech Republic and SR during intra-communitarian delivery and acquisition of goods shows the following scheme.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intracommunitary delivery</seg>
<seg id="232">If a VAT payer makes an intracommunitary delivery, he / she is obliged to submit SH by the 25. th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic presents in SH summary information about supplies of goods to another EU Member State exempted from VAT for previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in SR is obliged to state the value of goods exempted and delivered from the country to other EU Member States during the calendar quarter period.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the goods supplied are always available in Czech or Czech. in Slovak currency broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their tax ID, under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Service data are not included in SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds out that he has reported false data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the SR payer finds that the data provided in SH were incomplete or incorrect, he will submit a correct SH before the expiry of the deadline for submission of SH, after expiry of this period he is obliged to submit additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">VIES system allows exchange of VAT registration data for VAT registered in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from Czech Republic or. The SR can verify whether the customer's VAT is registered in a given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">The data from the SH submitted are on MF CLO or. DR CLO by VIES system grouped according to individual customer's tax.</seg>
<seg id="242">A cumulative value of all deliveries for each customer's tax and a code of the way they are filling from all their Czech or Czechs. Slovak suppliers, so-called. L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intracommunitary fulfilments between Czech Republic and SR (from L1QD files) is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system in another Member State detects erroneous customer's tax ID in the sent L1QD files, it will generate the so-called. O _ MCTL report containing all erroneous VAT with error type.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is then sent to MF CLO or. DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O _ MCTL report can contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect VAT ID, VAT is not registered in a given state or has never been assigned, the customer with a certain VAT number was not a VAT payer in a given quarter, the VAT registration of the customer was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received reports O _ MCTL to the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If an EU payer's malfunctioning tax ID is used in one of the sh or subsequent SH lines, the ADIS system is generated by the ADIS system. ′′ Notice of doubt to VAT ID ".</seg>
<seg id="250">The IRS will verify whether the delivery of the payer registered for VAT in another EU Member State has actually occurred and will record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In SR, the DR CLO in VIES processes all O _ MCTL reports and sends them electronically to the local tax authorities together with identification of tax payers who have reported the wrong ID in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities subsequently invite the payer to submit additional SH and to provide valid VATs or VATs. The tax office will check the delivery of goods with the relevant payer when reporting an invalid VAT in the SH filed.</seg>
<seg id="253">The data on the number of erroneous VATs related to intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the SR are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Out of the total of 41 728 Czech payer VATs, listed in the SH Slovak payers between the 2. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005, there were 929 wrong IDs, i.e. 2,23 %.</seg>
<seg id="255">Out of the total of 62 997 VAT of Slovak payers, listed in the SH of Czech payers during the same period, there were 416 wrong IDs, i.e. 0,66 %.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the SR, Czech VAT payers reported on average less bad tax than SR payers.</seg>
<seg id="257">When checking the activities of financial or financials tax authorities found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of tax payer s' VAT registrations in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example.:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax body in the 4. th quarter of 2004, the report O _ MCTL was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer registration in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation established that the registration ended until 1. August 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- NKÚ SR further found that 6 tax entities filed a SH, which reported the wrong ID, but the O _ MCTL reports did not contain this ID.</seg>
<seg id="262">In SR the filed SH will be converted into an electronic form at the tax authorities and the data from them to DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">Following subsequent processing of this data in VIES system, DR CLO will send the so-called tax authorities to the relevant tax authorities. breakdowns of errors in SH filed by tax entities for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="264">NKÚ SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH to 26. 7. 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and 2. 2. 2006 (i.e. data processed after completion of the inspection).</seg>
<seg id="265">The comparison of data contains the following table.</seg>
<seg id="266">From the above data, it is apparent that the NKÚ SR control affected not only the reduction of the number of SH with the wrong ID (average of 199 SH / quarter) but also the reduction of the number of unpaired errors in SH (average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intracommunitary deliveries given by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intracommunitary delivery specified by this payer in quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should check the differences, eliminate any inconclusiveness and use the data obtained when determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">NKU, Czech Republic found that controlled financial authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values shown in SH and DAP was 537 thousand in these cases...</seg>
<seg id="272">Since the 3. th quarter of 2004, the ADIS system enabled the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values given in SH and DAP of up to 0,5 % of the total value of intracommunitary delivery according to SH as a conformity and set it in ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intracommunitary delivery in one quarter, 0,5 % of the value is an insignificant amount, therefore tax administrators should not set SH and DAP conformity without clarifying the causes of differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example: the tax administrator set a match without verification in case of difference in values of 1 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="275">Verification of differences in the Czech Republic and SR was complicated by the fact that SH was served by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">Tax administrators could not compare the intracommunitary supply values given in these DAP with the monthly taxation period at the time of DAP for the first two months of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, tax administrators learned about any non-compliance of data in DAP and SH only when tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was collected, or. Returned.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intracommunitary acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides inter alia information on the values of intracommunitary transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Buy goods in Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, data from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered by L2QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing the data are converted by the minimum and maximum daily currency rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the value of the acquisition given by the Czech payers in DAP for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the acquisition of goods declared by the payer in DAP should be within the minimum and maximum conversion values L1QD (L1min and L1max values).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in DAP is lower than the L1min value, the so-called is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities. verification order.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to local competent financial authorities, which must be investigated by the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders for controlled financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">NKÚ, Czech Republic found that the inspected financial authorities did not verify irregularities in the values of intracommunitary acquisitions, which were highlighted by delivered verification orders.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the values shown in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers was at least 148 thousand in these cases...</seg>
<seg id="289">NKÚ, Czech Republic selected 533 tax entities files for which controlled financial authorities received a verification order from MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The following common causes of differences between the values given in the DAP of the customer and the supplier's SH: on the side of the customer (Czech payer) in 263 cases, the customer did not indicate the acquisition of goods in proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in another taxation the period before he was entitled to tax, in 6 cases the customer stated the value of the goods acquired in the wrong DAP line, on the part of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases, EU payers included the values of the services provided to Czech in their SH payers, of which in 54 cases it was a payer from SR, in 39 cases the suppliers included the delivery of goods in a different tax period from the Czech Republic to their DAP, in 22 cases the suppliers reported incorrect ID in SH Czech payer, in 16 cases, suppliers reported incorrect values of delivery of goods in SH, in 12 cases suppliers included the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1. 5. 2004, in 5 cases suppliers included in the Czech Republic SH value of advances received.</seg>
<seg id="291">The most commonly misconception of the value of the services provided in SH was on the side of the SR payers.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were identified in the inspected financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example: when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference of 10 thousand. Kč was created by introducing the Slovak payer to SH for the 1. th quarter of 2005 services (construction work and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for differences was to include the values of advances received in SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers announced advances received from Czech payers in SH, resulting in a generated order to verify the difference of 3 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders for verification of goods purchased are generated only once in one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where the SH data changes in EU Member States such as: change of customer of goods in the Czech Republic or increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES system does not automatically alert these changes, the local competent tax manager of the goods purchaser without any other impulse about facts applicable to the correct determination of the tax liability of the goods acquired and there is a strong probability of tax evasion on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">By checking NKU, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">Slovak payer stated in SH for the 2. th quarter of 2004 the value of delivery of goods for a Czech payer of 1 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On June 1., 2005, the tax office sent a request for information to the Czech payer to SR, because the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of goods only 425 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="301">Based on the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 3. 1., in which he corrected data on the supply of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and by increasing the value of the supplied goods for another Czech payer from 194 thousand. Sk to 160 1 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers announced intracommunitary delivery to the Czech Republic for the 2. th quarter of 2004 240 thousand. Sk (i.e. 8 183 thousand..).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech buyers did not show intracommunitary acquisition in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">Based on international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, which was not listed in SH by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the 1. th quarter of 2005 Slovak payers increased the value of intracommunitary delivery for this Czech payer by 10 thousand in additional SH regarding the 2. th quarter of 2004 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="306">Due to the above facts, the local tax manager in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the DAP for the 2. th quarter of 2004, although the real customer failed to fulfil the obligation to admit intracommunitary acquisition for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">NKÚ Czech Republic found that based on international exchange of information between tax administrations, VAT was additional for the tax period 5 and 6/2004 of 3 thousand. Kč and for the 3. th quarter 2004 of 3 305 thousand. Kč from goods purchased during these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">From the above, it is evident that tax administrators had to check not only the differences caused by the errors of the DAP by the purchaser, but also the differences caused by different reporting of intracommunitary supply and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">Unification of the conditions for reporting such data would lead to a streamline of the control activities of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="310">Buy goods in SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In the SR, the APV DIS system allows comparison of the value of goods acquired through the VIES system from other EU Member States with the data contained in the DAP by Slovak customers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which data are compared is called the ′′ MIN-MAX Method ".</seg>
<seg id="313">Using this method, a conversion of the value of delivery of goods specified in SH payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">There will be an interval of MIN-MAX, which is used for comparing with the values of acquisition of goods specified in DAP by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CLO will send tax administrators information on intracommunitary acquisitions values listed in DAP and EU delivery values in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator will decide for which VAT registered persons will be tested, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">Based on data provided by the DR CLO, the NKÚ SR selected 57 writings of Slovak goods from the inspected tax authorities, of which 25 payers acquired goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences between acquisitions obtained from VIES and values were found declared in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="318">The controlled NKÚ SR inspection confirmed that the tax administrators did not thoroughly check the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data contained in the DAP of Slovak customers.</seg>
<seg id="319">NKÚ SR asked tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities as part of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the NKÚ SR inspection at tax authorities, 31 local investigation was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies, which VIES showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States from EU Member States. found the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="322">In DAP for the 4. st quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not indicate the value of acquiring goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic accidentally reported the payer's VAT in the SH for the 4. th quarter of 2004, with goods worth 19 thousand. Kč actually delivered to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to VIES, the Slovak company was supposed to buy goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4. th quarter of 2004 thousand. Sk and max 105 715 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company submitted DAP for the period in which it stated the value of acquisition of goods from the EU of only 480 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, finding that the tax operator bought electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers did not indicate intracommunitary delivery to SH and DAP according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">Due to other discrepancies in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax manager will request a review of the value of the goods supplied via SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">The acquisition of goods from EU Member States in the 4. th quarter of 2004 was not stated by the Slovak payer in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to VIES, this payer should have bought MIN 11 thousand goods. Sk and max 845 11 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office conducted a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax operator did not acquire any goods from EU Member States in the 4. st quarter of 2004</seg>
<seg id="332">The NKÚ SR recommended the tax office to request inspection of the supply of goods from EU Member States via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">In VIES system VIES the delivery of goods for Slovak customers worth MIN 557 thousand was reported. Sk and max 565 thousand. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="334">The payer showed no acquisition of goods in DAP during the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004</seg>
<seg id="335">Local investigation of the tax administrator found that the tax agency received an invoice from the Czech Republic for material used in repair of hydraulic loader on 10. June 12.</seg>
<seg id="336">NKÚ SR recommends a tax check on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the NKÚ SR inspection in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases NKÚ SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax check on tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax checks will be submitted by the tax authorities following their implementation of the NKÚ SR.</seg>
<seg id="340">These cases were, for example:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak customer did not mention the acquisition of goods from EU Member States in DAP for the 4. th quarter of 2004 and paid no tax for the 10 to 12/2004 tax period and claimed the right to pay excess VAT deduction of total 1 236 Thousands. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax body bought goods worth 683 thousand from the Czech Republic. EUR (approx. 27 080 thousand. Sk).</seg>
<seg id="343">These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to customs in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>

<seg id="345">The tax manager is carrying out a tax check on the tax body.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the DAP data of the Slovak payer for the 3. st quarter of 2004 to 1. quarter of 2005 and the supply data reported by payers from EU Member States in each quarter was totaling 4 thousand I'm sorry. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the tax agency bought goods from suppliers from Czech Republic and Belgium and sold these goods to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by export uniform customs declarations.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of goods in DAP was not stated by the tax agency, according to the company manager, the goods under the transit procedure were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The tax operator did not submit any VAT registration during the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">A tax check was started with the payer.</seg>

<seg id="370">International cooperation enabled the selected intracommunitary transactions between VAT payers from Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="371">The examination of the selected transactions found that, based on international exchange of information, tax administrations of both countries revealed cases of companies carrying out fictional intracommunitary commercial transactions to obtain excessive VAT deductions and also cases where the buyers did not pay VAT on the goods received at the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">The inspection further identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The inspection also highlighted problems caused by different reporting of data on intracommunitary supply and acquisition of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">Unification of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlined monitoring activity of the Member State s' tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="375">By checking the financial or financial procedure tax authorities in the management of VAT and the use of VIES system have been found to be financial or. the tax authorities did not use sufficiently all VIES options and relevant legal permissions.</seg>
<seg id="376">It was also found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on goods supply and validity of VAT registration in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">NKÚ SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with data processed after the completion of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="378">From the comparison of these data it was apparent that the check of the NKÚ SR had an impact not only on the reduction in the number of SH with the wrongly mentioned ID, but also on the reduction of the number of unmixed errors in SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In case of irregularities in reported NKÚ SR data, the tax authorities asked for local investigations or tax checks to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="380">NKU, Czech Republic did not have such an option within the valid legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The knowledge gained by the control actions showed that VIES provided tax administrators with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-communitarian transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Since there is still room for tax evasion in this area, increased attention should be given to intracommunitary transactions when managing VAT.</seg>

<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of tax entities duties in imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the financial and controlled financial or. tax offices selected files of tax entities according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the SR: (a) with the highest import volume, (b) with the highest amount of VAT collected, (c) with the highest export volume,</seg>

<seg id="182">Overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risk commodities in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Check of selected sample at the financial authorities</seg>
<seg id="184">NKÚ focused mainly on controlled financial authorities:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of the financial authorities in verifying the accuracy of the VAT declared,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation of the financial authorities with customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at the financial offices with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or. comparison of data on JCD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- comparison of VAT tax return data on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at financial offices or customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- the method of verifying the right to exemption from VAT on export of goods or services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services reported in VAT tax returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the financial authorities only contained records of those imports and exports where tax entities were obliged to introduce imports or exports into their tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The inspected financial authorities examined tax agencies files reported imports totalling 60 396 thousand in VAT tax returns in 2002 and 2003 Kč and the corresponding VAT totaling 12 644 052 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="193">The tax corporations reporting in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were also checked, totalling 47 323 111 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="194">Tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the SR were examined, according to the customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 and 2003, made imports into the Czech Republic from SR with a total VAT base of 3 759 thousand I'm sorry. Kč, VAT of 767 607 thousand. CZK and exports from Czech Republic to SR with a total statistical value of 1 989 090 thousand...</seg>
<seg id="195">Differences found between records in the JCD database at the financial offices and the Czech customs database were checked as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items, which were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic, were requested directly at the Directorate-General of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- JCD items that were missing from the IRS database were verified whether these were cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for JCD items, where different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the financial authorities, the relevant JCD were requested at the Directorate-General of Customs of the Czech Republic, including the attached invoices.</seg>

<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences found</seg>
<seg id="201">The following differences were found by comparing the JCD database at the financial authorities and accumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in VAT tax returns for the selected sample of tax entities:</seg>
<seg id="202">The differences in values were mainly caused by:</seg>
<seg id="203">- Time shift between the implementation of imports and the claim to deduct VAT measured on importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The tax agency could claim the tax deduction on imports of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the goods were placed under the relevant procedure or. in the case of temporary importation regime, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the scheme was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time shift between exports and the moment the tax body received JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The tax body was obliged to provide information on exports exempted from the obligation to apply tax on the output tax return to VAT tax return first for the tax period in which the goods came out of the country, provided that it also had a tax document which was JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to comply with tax entities obligations when reporting imports and exports in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases tax entities did not include correct data on imports and exports in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to VAT filed tax returns, it was difficult to check the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Co-operation of the financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the period controlled, the customs authorities decided to repay or exemption from import or export duties and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax entities were lawfully imposed to reduce the previously applied right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the transmission of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some inspected financial authorities received this information, however irregularly or with significant delay and only from certain customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One controlled financial authority did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office has not received information about changes in customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the information needed to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002 the customs authorities paid VAT back more than 319 miles. Kč and in 2003 in over 398 miles...</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the inspection pointed out the ongoing deficiencies in the activity of tax administrators, some systemic errors in cooperation of the financial authorities with customs authorities and failure to comply with certain duties of tax payers filing tax returns and spd.</seg>
<seg id="219">The management of VAT and SPD identified shortcomings especially in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">(a) when VAT registrations were cancelled, the payer s' obligation to pay VAT on the commercial property of the registered owner, or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration for which the payer applied the tax deduction, was verified only in a rare way,</seg>
<seg id="221">(b) the financial authorities did not thoroughly use the opportunity to carry out a tax check or a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">This in some cases caused a lack of verification of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">(c) the official records and oral conduct protocols did not contain all the necessary data demonstrating the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied;</seg>
<seg id="224">(d) the financial authorities did not adequately verify imports and exports declared in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in SR</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Check of selected sample at tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample NKÚ SR verified or the tax authority carried out a tax check for the 2002 and 2003. tax period.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the tax returns filed and tax refund applications for selected tax entities NKÚ SR, the tax authority asked to provide the relevant JCD evidence of imports and exports, invoices and documents of tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the NKÚ SR checked whether the JCD submitted were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the deciding facts and statutory conditions for the application of the tax deduction on entry from the importation, the refund of excess VAT, the application of the exemption from the export title and the refund SpD.</seg>
<seg id="230">NKÚ SR verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between SR and Czech Republic in a structure according to the tribute to JCD items and the sum of statistical values listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports at 856,2 mil statistical value were checked. Sk, representing 5,11 % of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked totalling 176 miles. Sk, from the total value of exports of selected commodities from SR to the Czech Republic represent 6,87 %.</seg>
<seg id="233">618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white equipment, packaging and software) from EU states to SR were also checked. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Co-operation of tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">NKÚ SR by checking at tax offices found irregularities between data registered in the SR customs database and data reported in specific VAT tax returns, e.g.</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (natural persons) reported imports of goods totalling 1 589 261 Sk in tax returns, which made them entitled to excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the NKÚ SR complaint, tax agencies failed to demonstrate to the tax authority the right to apply the entry tax by relevant documents of imports and VAT payment,</seg>
<seg id="238">- the tax body (s.r.o.) declared in tax return for the taxation period January 2003 the taxable amount of 167 77 576 Sk, export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and has applied excessive VAT deduction of 17 157 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VAT tax returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchase and exports of 535 59 161 Sk resulting from January 2003 was not compensated throughout 2003</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above mentioned cases, NKÚ SR asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax check of excessive VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax body (s.r.o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 reported exports of goods totaling 87 199 Sk in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="242">The verification in the customs database of SR found that the tax body made exports at statistical value of 296 747 Sk during that period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax office carried out multiple local inquiries at the company's headquarters, finding that the company manager (UK citizen) had traveled and the company left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the NKÚ SR control, the tax administrator reported to the criminal proceedings authorities a notice of suspicion of non-tax failure to commit a crime.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the inspection at selected tax authorities, the NKÚ SR states that the biggest problems in the exercise of VAT and VAT control and SpD were mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- non-use of the possibility to carry out a tax check of VAT on problematic tax entities, especially in cases of high value of excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="247">- tax inspection protocols did not contain a list of checked documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient examination of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- the lengthy management of tax administrators when making decisions, especially in the context of the assessment procedure, as well as the result of the demise of the right to measure sanctions,</seg>
<seg id="251">- non-compliance with legal conditions when providing tax deferrals,</seg>
<seg id="252">- noncompensation of VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excessive VAT deduction,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">Based on the check of the identified deficiencies of the NKÚ SR, the competent tax authorities asked for a tax inspection of VAT with a focus on the legitimacy of the excess VAT applied for 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">All inspected tax authorities have been taken measures to eliminate the control of the identified deficiencies, which will be monitored and controlled by the NKÚ SR.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation enabled the examination of commercial transactions between trading partners from both States and highlighted the shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The result of the checks was also the finding of persistent deficiencies in the performance of VAT and SPD payers duties, in financial or financial activities. tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately decreased the effectiveness and effectiveness of tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="259">The knowledge gained also revealed that the financial authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Czech Customs database within the tax information system. There is no similar system in SR for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of VAT and SpD management was not the same due to different rules and conditions in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="261">NKÚ verified the necessary data from the information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available at the inspected financial offices. NKÚ SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from tax entities requested via tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">In case of irregularities, the tax authorities asked to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="263">Parallel checks carried out in the VAT and SpD area evaluated the state of management of these taxes during the period before joining the European Union and pointed out the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">The cooperation between each other will further deepen during the monitoring of financial and financial activity. tax authorities in connection with the adoption of a new VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new duties related to the supply of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of the so-called. summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be submitted by all VAT payers who made the delivery of goods to another Member State to a VAT registered person in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from summary reports into VIES (VAT Information Exchange System), to which tax administrators of Member States of the European Union have access to.</seg>
<seg id="268">Financial, resp. tax authorities then have the opportunity to compare these data with the data given in the VAT tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is also used to verify the validity of VAT tax persons, verification of the validity of the VAT exemption applied for delivery of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between NKÚ and NKÚ SR.</seg>
<seg id="271">Results of these control actions will be confronted with outputs of prepared inspection actions, which will, among other things, focus on vetting the VIES system to prevent tax evasion in the so-called. ′′ intracommunitary deliveries ".</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budgetary revenue, control activity should be focused mainly on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the space for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Migration of the population is one of phenomena that has a global character and have become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its cause is especially the escape of citizens from the country of origin or the last permanent residence from persecution, especially for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, and the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their goal is to acquire asylum and integrate into society, especially in one of Europe's developed democratic countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The large group is also made up of foreigners, whose reason for migration is adverse economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the Geneva agreement of 1951 and the New York Protocol 1967 on the status of refugees accepted by the governments of signatory countries to apply them in their foreign-political orientation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the division in 1993, the Czech Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to fulfil the international documents adopted and confirmed their commitment within national legislation by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have enshrined asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's highest control office and the Slovak Republic related issues were focused on the asylum process and the related issues, whose results are contained in a joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the top supervisory authorities of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the ' Contract for Cooperation in Control Act ' (hereinafter referred to as ' the Treaty ') concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">Both parties committed in the contract to provide each other with information on legislation governing asylum proceedings in the state of the other Party, selected statistical data concerning the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The effort of parallel control action was to identify identical troubled circuits and highlight the consequences of this for population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted of unifying the programme of control actions, exchanging information within the scope of the Treaty and drawing up a common final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the first joint action between 5.4. and 7.4.2004, the same circuits of controlled issues and control procedures were established during the preparation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">The second meeting, which took place from 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, specified common points for the programme of control action.</seg>
<seg id="22">The third joint meeting held during the inspection event from 8.11. to 10.11.2004 was exchanged experience from ongoing inspections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of output from the checks were specified and the structure and content of the Joint Final Report, which was drawn up between 14.2. and 17.2. 2005 at the last common meeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the inspectors of the Defense and Security Department and selected territorial unions carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The controlled persons were the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MV ′′) and the Ministry of Interior Refugee Facilities (hereinafter referred to as ′′ SUZ ′′).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, the section of defence, internal and staunch offices carried out a check.</seg>
<seg id="28">The controlled body was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Vnutra SR (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MÚ ′′).</seg>
<seg id="29">The controlled period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the period controlled).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data for a longer period are used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recap of inspection results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Assessment of control activity</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The interchange of experience gained between the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's High Supervisory Authority took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of inspection events.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange enabled more thoroughly evaluated the documents submitted, analyzing the causes of the identified differences in security of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">So it was possible to concentrate on decisive problems affecting the activity of asylum devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">Finally, this positively impacted the quality of the inspection activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of the results of the inspection</seg>
<seg id="39">Harmonization of asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents (hereinafter referred to as the EU) was the subject of European Commission evaluation reports to the preparedness of both countries for EU accession.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation regulating this area continues even after both countries join the EU with the aim of further harmonization with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of applicants for asylum in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a continuously growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is mainly affected by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings until the granting or granting of asylum and also the health status of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the parties to the asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Accommodation, eating, healthcare and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies are provided in asylum seekers during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include admission centres and residence centres, in the Czech Republic and integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one stay day depends on the occupancy and equipment of the Centre and are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Slovak Republic is projected to increase by nearly 1 000 places in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create conditions for applicants whose increasing numbers are expected to continue in the context of the Dublin Convention application in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest part of approved budgetary expenditure was spent on service security. The decisive spending of this item was the accommodation and eating of applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, healthcare expenses provided to asylum seekers and the cost of permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance were significantly involved in the overall expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of migration policy and asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures, which addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, material and services expenses and security services were crucial in drawing up current expenses.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental impact on financial management and state property management.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were shortcomings especially in the area of the use of state budget funds in contrast to the purpose for which the state budget law was determined when the current expenditure was covered by an action with the character of technical assessment of long-term material assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The accounting law in inventory and non-compliance with the account curriculum was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the handling of state property when it was left to another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Non-compliance with the deadline for reporting changes in the real estate cadastral data violated the Real Estate Cadastral Act and leaving waste to a person who was not a person entitled to waste management was violated.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also identified in the Slovak Republic when disproportionately high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, shortcomings in public procurement and management of state property, when its records were not sufficiently secured and no evidence of the disposal of unnecessary property was demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation that regulates the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.</seg>
<seg id="67">The Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic Supervisory Authority, despite some deficiencies identified, evaluate positively the SUZ and MÚ procedure in providing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the knowledge gained during the inspection, the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's Highest Supervisory Authority find that despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational components of both countries have managed tasks related to asylum seekers at an appropriate level I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the inspection were discussed with stakeholders of the relevant state organisational components on both Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that positive methodological experience of control be used in other joint control actions in the international cooperation of the highest control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the Geneva Convention 1951 (Convention on the Status of Refugees and the follow-up of the New York Protocol 1967).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first regulation was implemented by law no. 498/1990 Coll., about refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic there is an effective law no from 1. 1. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum and amendment of law no. 83/1991 Coll., about the police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="76">This law has been amended five times in total (law no. 2/2002 Coll., by law no. 217/2002 Coll., by law no. 320/2002 Coll., by law no. 519/2002 Coll. and by law no. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">In the legislative process there are currently two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum and adoption of other amendments will be bound to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of law making no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3. th pillar of the EU and asylum documents were in terms of commitment by political documents.</seg>
<seg id="79">As part of the adoption of this law, efforts have been made to make it as compatible with EU law as possible.</seg>
<seg id="80">A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the move of asylum issues from the 3. th to the 1. th pillar, when asylum law became part of the community law from 1.5. 1999 under the Amsterdam Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift triggered the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. create legal instruments in the corresponding legal obligation.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents was the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key communitarian regulations in the area of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the inspection of the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic has not yet elapsed.</seg>
<seg id="84">After their implementation into the Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to inform the European Commission how it has performed the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure for the granting of refugee status proceedings and the determination of duties of foreigners who applied for refugee status or who were granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1.1.1996 the law of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 283/1995 Z. from., about refugees.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003 the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No. 480/2002 Z. from ′′ on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws in which the harmonization of the Slovak Republic legislation with Council of Europe 20. 2001/55 2001 on minimum standards for provision of temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons and measures to support the balance of efforts between Member States in the adoption of such persons and endurance of the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to law no. 480/2002 Z z., asylum, in 2003 and 2004 a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonization of the Slovak Republic law with EU legislation in migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the determination of the duty for asylum to attend the courses of the Slovak language during their stay in the integration center, the determination of the guardian of the courts in non-age foreigners, when they stay in the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into a working relationship under certain circumstances, specified in the amendment to the law.</seg>
<seg id="89">Harmonization of the Slovak Republic law with EU law in migration and asylum process was evaluated in regular reports by the European Commission on preparedness for the entry of the Slovak Republic into the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002 the report highlighted the lack of staff capacity MÚ which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters concerning refugees have fallen within the competence of MV.</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective from 1. August 1., the MV established an organizational component of the SUZ state. The reason was to separate the state administration's performance in the area of asylum procedure, which is performed through the MV asylum and migration policy department, from providing services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of SUZ is to provide accommodation, food, health and other services to participants in asylum and asylum proceedings for MV.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic they perform decisive tasks in the area of the azylového asylum process, especially in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are questions related to decisions on foreigners applications for asylum in I. degree of administrative management and complex operation of asylum facilities in the area of accommodation, meals, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, he is preparing a concept for state migration policy.</seg>
<seg id="98">Results achieved in the area of asylum system production in the Slovak Republic in recent years have significantly influenced cooperation and support from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A special contribution was his financial complicity in the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="100">UNHCR co-financed social, cultural and sports activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of asylum seekers and asylum results</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.</seg>
<seg id="103">There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increased number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">Overview of the results of the asylum proceedings in the Czech Republic is given in Table No. 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the controlled period, asylum was granted in total 394 cases, of which 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 cases in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">Asylum was not granted in total in 22 cases in the controlled period and in 22 cases the asylum proceedings were terminated.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties to proceedings at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been subjected to the decision and those who have not been forwarded to the decision.</seg>
<seg id="108">Additionally, there are persons who have been forgiven for missing the deadline for filing an appeal or who have been annulled a previous decision and have not yet been issued a new one.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has a growing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10 358 people.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, with 8 131 applicants registered, representing an increase of 423 % against 2000, where 556 1 people applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">The information on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the controlled period is given in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylums were granted in the controlled period and their number did not exceed 0,22 % of the registered number of applicants in each year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">Asylum proceedings were stopped in total in 23 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">Most of the applicants voluntarily left the asylum procedure before ending it, by staying outside the asylum without permission.</seg>
<seg id="117">More than 82 % of the total registered applicants in 2002 and more than 94 % of people in 2003</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of one applicant's stay in one of the asylum facilities, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The poznatků knowledge also shows that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are looking for better living conditions, i.e. the so-called. economic migration that has no support in documents adopted by the international community, which the Slovak Republic has also signed up for.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases the asylum system is purposely used by the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons such as job seeking or better living conditions is not a reason to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an application should be according to the provisions of § 12 ods. 1 (1) (a) Act No. 480/2002 Z. z., asylum, considered apparently unjustified and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">So far, internationally recognized principles are not established to identify economic migrants that distinguish them from those persecuted in the country of origin and which would allow the asylum process to accelerate.</seg>
<seg id="124">Given the above, it can be stated that the Slovak Republic is transit countries and migration target countries were and remain West European states in terms of international migration.</seg>
<seg id="125">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic after accession to the EU acceded to the agreement defining the state responsible for assessing asylum applications submitted in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents multiple purpose applications for asylum in multiple EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants return to the country of first registration after positive identification in the EURODAC system.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until the decision to grant or not grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Pumping of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and their forthcoming national legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="131">The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure derived from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings until the final decision on asylum and their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The growing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on higher drawing of law-adjusted benefits for applicants, such as food, allowance, expenses on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some benefits collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, during the controlled period there was a meal of CZK 58 per person per day, allowance CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost of one asylum seeker for one stay day was on average 351 CZK in 2001, 383 CZK in 2002 and 345 CZK in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">Outside of pocket money, applicants for asylum lodged in residential centres with separate cooking and applicants who are private outside asylum facilities may be given a contribution up to the minimum of life.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, inter alia, in § 84 municipalities, entitles to a contribution to cover costs incurred in connection with asylum facilities in its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was set annually by government resolutions and in the controlled period it was CZK 7 per person and residential day.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools visited by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the contribution was 120 CZK per pupil per month during the controlled period, provided that the person attended school for at least 10 days in a given month.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, during the controlled period, 70 Sk per person per day, pocket 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost of one asylum seeker for one stay day was an average of 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">The municipalities in whose territory there is an asylum facility, are in accordance with Law No. 480/2002 Z. from., asylum, a contribution to partial reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">Meanwhile, municipalities have only partly used the opportunity to apply for a contribution set at 1 500 Sk per bed and calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries for asylum decisions sets a 90-day deadline from the opening of the asylum procedure and at the same time admits an extension of this period in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the procedure for asylum, which affects the amount of state budget spending, is the appeal against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31,54 %).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of application for asylum (17,61 %).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73 % of asylum proceedings initiated between 2001-2003 were decided within one year of their opening.</seg>
<seg id="151">92 % of asylum applications were decided on within two years of the opening of the asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="152">According to. data, up to 90 % of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic use the legal possibility of extending the deadline by appeal to the court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases, the extension was over a year and at the time of the inspection, the court proceedings were not closed.</seg>
<seg id="154">A certain contribution in the shortening of asylum proceedings is expected from the establishment of common workplaces MÚ and the Úradu of the border and chadzinec Policy in the admission centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Village and in Liptovských Vlachoch, which was attended at the time of inspection from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This implies simplification of procedures and reducing the deadlines of proceedings between the two components of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum devices</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for providing services to participants in asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="158">Asylum facilities provide accommodation, meals, health care, pocket and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during the stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time courses are organised in leisure activities and conditions for cultural and sports activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and runs asylum facilities and is competent to manage state property in the premises of the reception center Vyšní Lhota, the reception and residence center Červený Újezd, Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka near Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the objects of the integration asylum centres of Jaromer and Stop near Brno.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, an admission center was established in the transit space of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ further ensures the operation of asylum facilities in Stráži pod Ralsko, Seči, Bruntál, Zbýšově and Kashava, which are operated by a legal person based on § 80 (80). Article 3 of Law No. 325/1999 Coll, asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the admission centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Receiving centres are closed facilities that asylum seekers must not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic admission procedures referred to in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violence of the duty to stay in the admission center is considered a misdemeanor.</seg>
<seg id="167">Residence centres where asylum seekers from reception centres are used to accommodate applicants for asylum until the time of legal power is acquired, decisions on their application for or not granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="168">Under certain conditions, asylum seekers are allowed to leave residence centres or. stay in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, food, other services and allowance in the admission and residence centres in which they are reported, where they are entitled to free accommodation, provision of food, other services and allowance, provided that they have suffered the necessary actions to identify their financial and property ratios, and these ratios are such that they cannot be fairly asked for even partial payment of the services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres serve temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are staying in the center based on a accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until adequate housing is provided for them, or will be secured by themselves under the state integration program.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration center, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with a confessed refugee status have the same rights and duties as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Cost of asylum equipment</seg>
<seg id="175">For comparison of asylum facilities, the best indicator of the amount of costs per physical stay day was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the factual number of persons who were actually provided daily services provided by asylum equipment.</seg>
<seg id="177">In table no. 3 and in the graph are devices operated by SUZ designated as own and facilities operated by legal persons under Section 80 of Law No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one stay day in the own asylum facility operated by SUZ decreases with the increasing fulfillment of these facilities. The cause is that the fixed cost of operating objects is calculated on multiple asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The volume of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers is directly increasing with their growing number.</seg>
<seg id="180">Between 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis capacity were lodged in their own asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, exceptional accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds) was used to solve the capacity crisis of asylum asylum seekers caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was secured by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">One applicant's spending for one stay day was then lower in these years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, long-term maintenance of high fulfilment of these devices is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">It is necessary to take into account the risks of unexpected flows of refugees and the associated requirement for higher accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum installations operated contractually allows the adoption of operational solutions in the area of asylum facilities, where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and stay centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The MÚ has Adamov-Gbely, Rohovka, Opatovská Nová Ves and the stay center Brezová pod Bradlom in its administration.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of the admission centres is 470 seats and a residential center of 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">The growing number of asylum seekers handled. by setting up a residential center in Gabčíkově in rented premises of the Slovak Technical University Bratislava with flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 places.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the contract concluded, the leaseer also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, MÚ was dealing with lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential center was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 places.</seg>
<seg id="196">The admission centres had an average of 57 % to 62 % during the controlled period, on average from 33 % to 50 % in the residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="197">The occupancy changed according to the season and the highest was in the last months of the year, when he applied for asylum for a much larger number of applicants compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Another increase in accommodation capacity by about 450 places will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovskej Novej Village and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">After the construction of the Humennom resort in 2006, the number of places will increase by another 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of asylum equipment</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the amount of costs of asylum installations are shown in Table No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body that provides spaces and ensures the operation of the facilities including related activities is one of the ways to ensure, at reasonable costs, the tasks resulting from the residence of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of funds and state property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of management</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, the approved budgetary expenditure of SUZ was increased by 077 103 thousand in 2001..</seg>
<seg id="206">Of which 89 thousand. Kč (87,29 %) were purposely intended. The large part was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (44 538 thousand. Kč) and provision of health care provided to asylum seekers (38 870 thousand..).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002 SUZ spending was increased by 88 88 thousand by 362 budgetary measures...</seg>
<seg id="208">Of which 62 thousand. Kč (70,48 %) was purposely designated means, of which mostly (53 200 thousand. Kč) was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003 SUZ spending was increased by 88 88 thousand by 078 budgetary measures...</seg>
<seg id="210">Of which 82 thousand. Kč (93,09 %) amounted to purposely designated funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">Amount 51 thousand. Kč was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers, 24 000 thousand. Kč to solve the tide of Chechen refugees and 7 000 thousand. Kč for the program of humanitarian evacuation of disabled people of Iraqi Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">Overview of the draft SUZ spending during the controlled period is shown in Table No. 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">From the above overview, it is clear that the highest part of the spending was spent on providing services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of costs incurred for the purchase of services ranged between 37,07 % and 38,23 % of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The outrageous expenditure under this item was expenses for accommodation and eating applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, medical expenses provided to asylum seekers and the cost of permanent security service ensuring security at individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance (23,99 %-24,97 %).</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, the purchases of material (around 14 %) were significantly involved in the total expenses of SUZ, with the highest share of these expenditures being the purchase of food (7,61 %? 9,83 % of total spending).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budget management of MÚ to ensure migration policy and asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">The draft and breakdown of the budget in the spending part was characterised in particular in 2001 and 2002 by the nerovnováha requirements, which were based on an increase in the number of applicants for asylum and the needs of financing their legal claims and resources provided mainly in the main category of ordinary spending.</seg>
<seg id="220">Over the course of the year, the budgetary chapter manager handled multiple budgetary measures, increasing the current spending limit by 41,8 % in 2001 and by up to 71,7 % in 2002</seg>
<seg id="221">Overview of the application of selected MÚ expenses during the controlled period is given in Table No. 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance ranging from 24,47 % to 30,51 % and material and services costs ranging from 21,04 % to 38,82 % of total costs.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10 % consisted of security costs and from 3,92 % to 7,20 % food purchase costs.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another significant part was the spending of accommodation and food services from 10,82 % to 26,96 %.</seg>
<seg id="225">The relatively low share between 1,03 % and 6,25 % was capital spending.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Deficiencies detected</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental impact on the management of funds and state property.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were shortcomings, especially in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget appropriations in violation of the purpose for which the state budget law was determined when ordinary expenses were covered by actions having the character of technical assessment of long-term material property; (b) infringement of the accounting law in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the indicative accounts curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the management of the state property, when it was left to use another person without an appropriate contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the real estate cadastral data was violated by the law on the cadastral of real estate; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person entitled waste management has been violated.</seg>
<seg id="230">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were found in the provision of disproportionate advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, shortcomings in public procurement and management of state property, when its registration was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the law no was introduced at SUZ on 1.7. 2002 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, interim and subsequent checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system has been established and an internal auditor of SUZ has been appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year SUZ is issued a plan of financial, socio-economic and operational technical checks aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of funds and state property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">In 2002 there were 42 management checks and in 2003 there were 54.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding laws and internal rules, the Office ensures the Minister's Control.</seg>
<seg id="237">During the period controlled, no inspection of tasks on the section of asylum policy was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system MÚ is mainly focused on the implementation of preliminary and interim financial control under Law No. 502/2001 Z. from., about financial control and internal audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The execution of financial control is also regulated by the internal rules of the director of MÚ</seg>
<seg id="240">The factual focus of the control activity as part of the management of individual departments was established under the annual MÚ plan.</seg>
<seg id="241">Designated by union directors were responsible for the exercise of control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the documentation submitted, no shortcomings were found.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the Ministry of Interior regulation of the Slovak Republic No. 28 out of 23. 4. 4. 2004 is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the complaints law.</seg>
<seg id="244">The organizational security of this task will need to be resolved in the upcoming period.</seg>
<seg id="245">Communicating</seg>
<seg id="246">This report was drawn up in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the Vice President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority and the chairman of Najvyšie's control office of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel checks on spending on the construction of the Prague - Dresden highway</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, modern, dynamic and above all united Europe would be hard to imagine.</seg>
<seg id="4">Quality transport networks are a necessary condition for maintaining and increasing the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of persons and costs is an important task for the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a very demanding task both organisational and technical and financial aspects.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts for sustainable mobility often and hardly find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and suitable environment for humans.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction of transport infrastructure, thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, buildings are financially demanding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Appropriate procedures and decision-making by the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport buildings can bring significant savings of public financial resources, which can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of control institutions is to actively look for shortcomings that led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on construction of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Control institutions should not only draw attention to the identified deficiencies, but recommend measures to improve the state, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">The two top supervisory institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as ′′ BRH ′′) and the Supreme Supervisory Authority (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) carried out parallel checks on expenditure on 2005 and 2006 construction of the highway Prague - Dresden (highway D 8 in the Czech Republic and highway A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">Highways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with NKÚ, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough check on the efficiency of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on close cooperation with BRH, NKÚ obtained the necessary data on the amount of German bridge and tunnel costs for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany closed in 2000th border bridge construction contract.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction procedure, the completion date was finally planned for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award of the contract, the Directorate of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ RSD ′′) caused mistakes that led to an extension of the competition period and shortening the time for construction.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, RSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">The prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 highways were compared with the calculation to m2 of the bridge construction area.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical price analysis allowed bridges with high costs per m2 area to be identified.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delay caused by the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analyzing the cost of building tunnels, the inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 highway are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and NKÚ now have a database of prices for bridges and tunnels, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Both control institutions recommend to build bridges: standardization of bridges and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only when pre-strung iron concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The main features of cooperation included her team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel inspection, the inspectors participated in their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report informs about the progress and results of parallel checks on funds spent on the construction of a highway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The checks were focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the costs incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel checks were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKU in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">NKÚ controlled the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately přibližně 690 million) on the border section of the D 8, highway, which has number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, 64 64 million from European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to a parallel inspection carried out together with NKÚ, BRH controlled the preparation and construction of the A 17 highway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The resources spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 highway amounted to about 670 670 million and of which. 277 million co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden - central and southern part of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 highway leads from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">Highway A 17 leads from the state border of the Czech Republic / Germany to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the inspection, border sections of both highways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were launched on December 21., 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the highway is completed all the way to Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D 8 highway is not finished, because section no. 0805 in length 16,4 km across the Czech Mountains between Řehlovicemi and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section no. 0805 between Prague and Ústím nad Labem to walk through the protected landscape area of Czech Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, it should be in r. 2008 on the border section no. 0807 highway D 8 traffic intensity 22 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will amount to about 25 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="50">Germany and the Czech Republic concluded in 2000 a contract between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the connection of the German highway A 17 and the Czech highway D 8 on a common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of parallel checks carried out by both control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation of BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two top control institutions acted on close cooperation in the inspection of the highway building connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both parties had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany is financially involved in building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction is based on RSD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH himself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">NKÚ did not have a comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the total cost of bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">NKÚ needed to be sure about the effectiveness of spending, taking into account the main technical parameters of the highway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, on 4. January 2006, the Presidents of the two top control institutions were signed an agreement on coordinated inspection of the highway D 8 / A 17.</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint work discussions between the BRH and the NKU inspectors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The negotiations were dealing with current problems and tasks, especially the preparation of a uniform methodology for control of prices of bridges and tunnels, exchange of findings from border bridge control and preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">An important sign of cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH has done most of the work to compare the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and procurement procedures, NKÚ has prepared for the most part a methodology for the price of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for control in the state administration differ in both countries in the way control actions are closed.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two top supervisory institutions have drawn their own control conclusions on their findings obtained during their checks.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved during parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will be concluded with the signing of the final komuniké in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in the 2000 contract on the date of completion of the border bridge construction as possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two parties then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RSD was an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany financially contributes to the construction of a bridge from 42,13 %.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period until 1999, the RSD proposed that the border bridge should have a pre-concrete concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, after agreement with its partners in Germany, the RSD agreed a coupled steel-concrete construction.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by reducing the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent ecological benefit of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, comparative calculations performed by the RSD stated that coupled steel-concrete construction should be a less expensive option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">It stated that the new coupled steel-concrete construction will only be 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In reality it is 5 % longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the border bridge contract, the RSD made serious mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="85">It did not prepare a contract documentation to adequately describe the assessment criteria and the partial criteria for comparing tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the Commission's Assessment and Assessment of Bids and the Director-General evaluating offers in a subjective and problematic way.</seg>
<seg id="87">The failed candidate contested the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent investigation of the Competition Authority led to the contract awarding of the construction contract being signed later than originally expected.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the summer construction season 2004 after the evaluation of offers was wasted and the construction time has been shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The procedure offered included double installation of the bridge top, change in pillar construction and installation and equipment of assembly premises.</seg>
<seg id="92">Moreover, the construction company was not able to acquire the originally designed steel type in the necessary term.</seg>
<seg id="93">A new type of steel - at a price higher by about zhruba 4 million, which had to be fully paid by the RSD - allowed the time to be reduced to anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently allowed to shorten the total time of construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of 18,3 18,3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge due to accelerated progress and other financing adjustments will increase considerably.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened time reserved for works led to an increase in the price of about 5,9 5,9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Currently, the net cost amount is around kolem 25,9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Price comparison of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">Both top control institutions analyzed the prices of bridges on D 8 and A 17 highways to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare bridges on the German and Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">The tunnels on D 8 were also compared with similar tunnels on the highways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A 17 highway.</seg>
<seg id="102">When preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify the relevant prices accurately.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two top supervisory institutions established the following principles to compare bridges prices: based on the actual price paid for a bridge without value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to changes); do not take into account prices for special foundations of the bridge; transfer prices in CZK na na according to the European Central Bank rate valid on 30. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = = 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various structures (steel-concrete, pre-concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure homogeneity of the structures examined, bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups the size of the bridge was also taken into account during the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction were concrete bridges (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the number of the file enabled the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high level of reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The checks found that the prices for m 2 concrete bridges on D 8 i A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech ones (see below charts).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on A 17 and four on D 17 have been identified, whose price is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">To search these bridges, a method was used to enable atypical values to be detected in a set of numbers, and a regression analysis reflecting the dependency of the price of the bridge to its size (to determine atypical expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upward).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should be considered only as an indicator on which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of high price in each identified case should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be an inefficient administrative measure, or also environmental requirements or other acceptable reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German (see table below), the proven negative dependency of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis about lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labor costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the results of the analysis show that concrete bridges prices on D 8 are higher than the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two possible causes of this situation were identified during joint negotiations:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an assignment allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the contract competition.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the highway route, which is several kilometers long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic there is more variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">NKÚ found in this context that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is taken at the time when the RSD translates the application for territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">RSD is choosing types of bridges from multiple variants at this time, but economics plays a smaller role in deciding.</seg>
<seg id="130">The general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be expressed on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of tunnels on D 8 were twice the size of the tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, comparison of main construction-technical parameters of tunnels to D 8 with tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the Czech Republic in the construction of tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, a small number of tunnels did not allow for generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">The effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden highway - Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was created in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">The government approved the concept of highway network development in the same year.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 highway should have been gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No. 0805 through the Czech Mountains should have been purchased earlier than the border section no. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 highway as part of programming.</seg>
<seg id="142">In program no. 327 220 ′′ The construction of the highway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - the state border of the Czech Republic / Germany ′′ set two goals for construction of the D 8 highway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection of Prague and Ústí nad Labem - national goal;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection of Prague and Berlin within IV. trans-European transport corridor Berlin - Istanbul - international goal.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the program, the construction of the section of the leader across the Czech Mountains was supposed to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section no. 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added here that the date of completion is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">NKÚ found out that the preparation of the construction of the section of the head over the Czech Mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists contested this decision by lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">The lawsuits are not decided legally.</seg>
<seg id="152">Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the section leading through the Czech Mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the program documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the deadline for completion of section No. 0805 for 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">Due to these facts, the construction of the border section of the national goal has not achieved a better link between Prague and Ústím nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">RSD has made an estimate of capital costs for border section D 8 No. 0807 and section no. 0805 through Czech Mountains from 1999 to 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate of these capital costs included in the investment costs is about 639 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and no. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Economic Assessment Results (EIRR EIRR Internal Revenue Rate)</seg>
<seg id="158">All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 18 vehicles per day in r. 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 22 vehicles per day in r. 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 25 vehicles per day in r. 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 based on the assumption that the border section and section across the Czech Mountains will be completed on time.</seg>
<seg id="165">However, at the time of inspection, it is clear that the section across the Czech Mountains will not be open in the original term.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections without VAT, calculated at 31. 12. 2005, was 897 897 million, i.e. higher 27,4 % than the cost level with which the economic analysis worked in 27,4 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section no. 0805 will be guided in a different, costly route, which would affect the abovementioned economic viability limit.</seg>
<seg id="169">Economic analysis showed that construction of both sections of the highway is economically viable with at least 18 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 amounted to 22 vehicles, but the study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Mountains anticipates the traffic intensity of 12 to 13 vehicles per day, which moves an investment below the economic viability limit.</seg>
<seg id="171">With the higher load of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not expected during the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The abovementioned reduction in revenue and cost increase means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8. will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">The construction of the A 17 highway was similar cost overrun as in the case of these two sections on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for Long-distance transport for 1992 The Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany counted about náklady 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost / income ratio was then 4,6.</seg>
<seg id="177">Meanwhile, however, costs have risen sharply to about 670 670 million and the cost-income ratio has decreased by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to a parallel inspection carried out together with NKÚ BRH, he controlled the preparation and construction of the A 2005 highway in 2003 and 17.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, BRH found that the competent approval state authority requested a field tunnel for the third section A 17 that was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the inspection event, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German road construction administration that the tunnel is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">The result was the achievement of savings, which amounted to about 10 10 million and 0,15 million on annual operating costs alone.</seg>
<seg id="182">Assessing the first section A 17 BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">The following example shows this:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the road construction administration did not research the conditions of the rock base in the rocks of Dölzschen because the place was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks are more weathered inside than expected during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injecting and protective net against stone falling, which required about 3,3 3,3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">Road and Highway Directorate had to bear costs not only for other emergency operations such as security measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also measures that would not be necessary if the construction project was properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs associated with interruption of construction operations ((3,2 million), further training of drilling workers ((0,5 million) and increasing wages and goods costs due to overrun of the project duration (7 7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost exceeding amounted to about zhruba 10,7 million, which was not equal to any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">Based on the lessons learned from this and other controlled projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply more strict leadership in its supervision of road construction work.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Federal Ministry should give the directors of roads and highways the necessary incentive to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both control institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, assignment and progress of the border bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both top control institutions have built a database of bridges and tunnels prices, which will be able to base future checks.</seg>
<seg id="196">NKÚ found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and route of the D 8 highway are no different from parameters A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">Controllers of both cooperation institutions have gained new experience to use in further checks.</seg>

<seg id="22">Czech version is crucial in case of a dispute.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Contracting Parties claim to be Appendix No. 1 read that they agree with its content and that Appendix No. 1 was closed freely, seriously, not in distress under strikingly disadvantaged conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">To prove these facts, the participants of this Treaty attach their own signature.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds for financing projects carried out under the Operational Programme of Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The emerging community of Europe's population is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let this community provide the opening word for this joint report of the two highest control institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">′′ 185 million EU citizens (i.e. 37 % of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often the remains of the darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to help to mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Programmes cover various border regions: some cover seaside areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last seven years and a total of 5,7 billion is earmarked from the EU budget. EUR</seg>
<seg id="11">′′ The programmes cover the following activities: repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling trails and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, medical facilities, research centres, flood measures, etc., common management of natural sites or tourist goals, development of common services for the local population, employment advice, thematic networking and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the program is provided on the condition that the organization from both sides of the border (for example regional authorities, universities or SMEs) combines to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leaders of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners regularly meet and decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the program itself is finished.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funds are provided with the condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characters: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing."</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among the main attributes of partnership include: Joint Leader's Choice, Joint Project Development and Application, Joint Partnership Agreement signed by all partners, taking over overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the leading partner, total payment of support receives by the partner and executes their transfer to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out in the territory of regions and voivodeship adjacent to a common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CHECK</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11. December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the operation programme of cross-border cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS Czech-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">258 187 467 €. has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from the European Funds (ERDF) totalling 459 219 344 (85 %) to be exhausted by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data on the drawing of EU funds from the Cross-border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement on cooperation of the highest control institutions of the Czech Republic (NKU) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27. February 2013 following previous negotiations at the meeting of the heads of the highest control institutions of the Visegrad four, Austria and Slovenia in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to check whether the implementation of the operational programme is in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system works reliably, whether the operational programme goals are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the aid granted I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took a form of parallel control, whereby the inspection authorities independently examined topics whose content was discussed in advance by their legal mandate.</seg>
<seg id="27">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The inspection carried out also included elements of the performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were tested on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The results of the checks carried out were the checks foundations published in the usual way by both authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Based on both control conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report was created.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected common control sample included six projects (Annex 1) that fall within the aid area 1.1-Strengthening transport availability and support area 2.2-Supporting tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Before the start of the inspection, the drawing of funds from these two areas of support accounted for more than 60 % of the funds paid to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from ERDF for all projects implemented throughout the OPPS Czech Republic-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to checking a common sample of six projects, NKÚ checked 13 other projects and NIK two more (all from support area 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to beneficiaries of ERDF aid, controlled by NKÚ and NIK, amounted to a total of 362 25 (NKÚ) and 174 8 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The controlled amount of funds accounted for 41 % of all funds paid to the beneficiaries of the aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both checks independently carried out by NKÚ on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of importance.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of OPPS Czech Republic-POL, involving the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">Controlled persons, who were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and unused ERDF funds provided.</seg>
<seg id="42">Proof of the effectiveness of the projects implemented under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the set goals, which were supported by the results of the social evaluation of project implementation.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF CHECK RESULTS</seg>
<seg id="44">And. Assessment of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">A coordinated approach enabled the control and control system of the OPPS Czech Republic-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: managing authority (Ministry of Local Development of the Czech Republic), national coordinator (Ministry of Local Development POL) and controllers (Center for Regional Development and Voivodeship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit enabled the evaluation of tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the inspection focused on the activities carried out in connection with the set-up and performance of the function of the managing authority and the national coordinator, especially in the context of setting the programme's goals and monitoring of progress, evaluation activities and annual reports, evaluation, selection and approval project applications, drawing up program funds and fulfilling the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, further with the control activities of the managing authority, setting up the performance of the activities and output from the audits of the delegated audit body, and with the reporting and monitoring system of irregularities and compliance with the irregularities monitoring, at the same time it has been verified coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the OPPS Czech Republic-POL.</seg>
<seg id="48">The activities of the competent authorities in the field of risk analysis and the compilation of project monitoring plans were further examined and evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">Verification of the control system included a review of administrative checks and on-the-spot checks, which allowed approval, e.g. supply of goods and co-financed services, eligibility of expenses submitted for reimbursement, while consistency of the payment of such funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant shortcomings have been identified by NKÚ control in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, the risk of non-transparentness of the process was identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other shortcomings were identified in the area of monitoring indicators settings and in the settings of irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Supervisory Authority evaluated the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Irregularities identified by NIK regarding the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules were not considered significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities only affected individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the whole OPPS Czech Republic-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite identified irregularities, NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Assessment of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The check did not show a contradiction between indicators and targets set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">Expected results were achieved in all projects, funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The check conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the social evaluation of projects described below in the text.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect that NKÚ and NIK have given attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the project's performance with regard to project goals and at the same time to the aims of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Supervisory Chamber initiative took place in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the common control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and evaluation was carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Training in Nyse (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">After agreement with the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2 820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey mainly covered the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of projects including investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents for each project is shown in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The survey response assessment suggested that the overall social evaluation of projects was good and reached a 4,8 point (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the project results were positively perceived by most respondents both in terms of goals and according to other parameters specified in project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to respondents, the projects examined met the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noticed the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and renewal of contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall evaluation of the answers suggested a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the goals / parameters (actual impact rate) and the expected respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of participants in panel discussions (target groups) conducted in the context of the NIK control on the Polish side, who highlighted the need for project implementation and confirmed their positive acceptance by the public and the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Assessment of the legality of controlled projects</seg>
<seg id="74">The beneficiaries of the aid examined the consistency of the factual and time implementation of the project schedule and the content of the project application, further examination of the achievement of the set goals and purpose of the project, fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, management of possible project revenue, fulfilment of the obligation separated project accounting records transaction, compliance with the ban on financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of project partnerships and compliance with its conditions, fulfilment of compulsory publicity regarding in particular the spread of awareness of sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of eligibility of project expenditure, selection of suppliers and verification of suppliers delivered on the basis of public awarded orders.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the shortcomings of qualified NKÚ and NIK as unfit for funding from EU funds was found at 094 85</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the specified level of importance related to the total controlled amount of funds for sample projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the discrepancies identified, NKÚ and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the commitments resulting from the conditions of the aid were properly fulfilled by the beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="79">Funds intended for the implementation of controlled projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nonetheless, seven of the eight beneficiaries of the aid controlled by NIK were found to be inconsistencies in the fulfilment of factual and financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of non-systemic nature and were concerned especially inconsistent preparation of project documentation and violation of public procurement rules, but did not affect the selection of contractors or supply of contracted works.</seg>
<seg id="82">Only in one of all projects controlled by NIK can the discrepancies detected as an unfit spending of PLN 43 003 of which was financed by z 8 ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other hand of the border, the NKÚ identified in three of the 19 controlled projects ineligible spending of CZK 2 098 (of which 863 76 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included non-delivery of paid material and works or expenses for modernizing property owned by a person who had no connection to the project or as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">Joint recommendation of the NKÚ and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system especially with regard to the consistent determination of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, it is also necessary to aim to identify such indicators at program level and projects to enable more reliable verification of the performance of the established impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Notes and recommendations resulting from checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate check conclusions of NKÚ and NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICS</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and Polish languages and signed by presidents of the highest inspection institutions of the Czech Republic and the Polish Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Procurement of public works contracts and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel control carried out by the Czech Supreme Supervisory Authority (NKÚ) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Procurement of public procurement for goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private sphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is to use public resources in the most efficient and economical way possible and ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU) public procurement is a key factor for the success of the single economic space.</seg>
<seg id="7">The EU has set limits in its regulations, where the contracting authority must meet certain requirements to guarantee a wide and unlimited competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States therefore need to transpose the European procurement right into their national rules and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public procurement that is value below EU limits, regulation of their award remains within the scope of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with subsequent high potential of damage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and incorrect advantage (corruption prevention).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Supervisory Authority of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel checks in the field of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as it was transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The checks included procurement below European limits to affect corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The control findings of the two top control institutions are summarized in a joint report, which is addressed, among other things, to international organisations such as the International Organization of Highest Supervisory Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Control areas and controlled institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The BRH assessment is based on the area checks of the above mentioned areas, which were carried out on German construction administrations responsible for federal transport and ground buildings between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, highway construction and large-scale projects of ground construction were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">BRH included findings from past checks in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The NKÚ evaluation is based on checks carried out between 2008 and 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the award of federal public procurement is mostly carried out by regional construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the state institution for road and rail construction is responsible for the award of public transport infrastructure contracts.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of ground construction, public procurement is carried out by beneficiaries of budgetary resources.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, external experts services are also used in individual procurement stages.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation must take into account differences in legislation on public procurement and the specialities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">The structure of the public procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the process of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="29">The procurement procedure limited to Germany is governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details regarding the requirements of European procurement law and corruption prevention are enshrined in the so-called. federal government procurement manuals where requirements are divorced or formulated into greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the public procurement law and other legislation concerning contracts with value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement right made substantial changes in 2012</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened room for more competition and reduced corruption opportunities during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fundamental aspects of procurement in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and narrower procedures must be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedure), but these are virtually identical to the abovementioned conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterized by the principle of preference for open proceedings (where interested in European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national proceedings).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open proceedings and in the invitation to participate in the competition, any interested person can submit an offer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another significant sign of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and by dividing into partial contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">Procurement of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the proceedings as many candidates as possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-proven tools to gain good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330 construction companies with 1,9 million employees are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic it is necessary to apply the conditions of European proceedings even in cases of public procurement with value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is a simplified sublimit procedure, where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a bargain price.</seg>
<seg id="48">Current Czech legislation allows contracting entities to choose between open procedure and narrower procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">85 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1 have 20 employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of contracting entities for public works and the share of different types of proceedings in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Kč, of which 1 138 billion. Kč (15 %) was the share of public procurement, which included contracts awarded by individual spolkovými and municipalities in addition to contracts awarded by the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of the Federal Road and Land Construction (without railway and water buildings) reached 212,5 billion...</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of the Federal Procurement of Land Construction and Transport Construction was as follows: 80,7 % open proceedings and public calls; 12,7 % closer proceedings and narrower calls;</seg>
<seg id="55">6,6 % negotiated procedure and direct procurement; 33,2 % is the share of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118,6 billion in 2011 Kč, which was about 25 % of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 it reached 194,0 billion. Kč, which was 37 % of the total volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14,3 % narrower procedures; 9,5 % negotiated procedures; 8,4 % simplified procedures for sublimit contracts; 2,7 % other procedures.</seg>
<seg id="59">The data included all public supply contracts, services and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The mentioned figures show that: parallel checks in both countries focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption to be held still has a significant financial impact; open meaning. procurement procedures are crucial.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of main results</seg>
<seg id="62">NKÚ and BRH performed parallel checks on the award of European works contracts with an emphasis on corruption prevention in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The checks were aimed at comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="64">Key findings below are:</seg>
<seg id="65">EU public procurement directive has been transposed into national rights of both countries (points 1. and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">The prevention of corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in the focus and in the details.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the essential requirement for the contract documentation to meet is the inclusion of all information needed for the preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">Specifications must be neutral and must contain no requirements limiting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The specification documentation in Germany meets these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is insufficient definition of the subject matter of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, division of contracts is required into parts where possible to support a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of BRH, this requirement is observed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">NKÚ checks showed that in the Czech Republic large public works in the area of road buildings are awarded without being divided into parts or divided, but only on volume very significant parts. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These restrictions on market potential can result in significant cost increases and incur a risk of non-serious price negotiation and inadmissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">Legislation in both countries allows contracting entities to supplement additional construction work under certain conditions if this need arises only after the contract is concluded (paragraph 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries the requirements for proper designation of the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, contracting entities can identify one of the open procurement procedures, open proceedings or closer procedures according to the applicable rules.</seg>
<seg id="78">German rules in procurement and budgetary law enshrine the priority of open procedures for both European tenders and national, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit an offer and also reduce the risk of corruption, because they make unlawful price negotiation among candidates difficult.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results in value for money are achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large procurement, whose expected total price exceeds or exceeds the limits laid down by the EU, controlled contracting entities have always written a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">In determining the type of procurement procedure, correct determination of the expected value of the contract plays a very important role.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used to determine the price of public works, where the values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is an objective enough tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but are not yet an effective tool (paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">Preliminary information and notice of the opening of the procurement procedure must be published in accordance with European procurement procedures, due to strengthening competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and / or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to participate in a closer procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="90">According to EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Beyond the EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should rotate as often as possible, who call for participation in the proceedings when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany there are partly very detailed requirements for preventing the risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, controlled contracting authorities did not follow these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting entities must ensure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between these candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of specifications must be prevented to the extent possible from limiting competition through illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the relevant measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the controlled German contracting authorities did not meet the said requirement in several cases (paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">The principle of cross control and transparency must be applied in both countries when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">Labelling requirements, documentation, protection and confidentiality of offers are supposed to restrict the space for manipulation and are especially detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Assessment and evaluation of tenders is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more complex, but have not always been respected by controlled contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities handed over their bids to third parties for consultation without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The tenders were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (paragraph 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">Participants must be informed about the intended award of the contract before the latter is finalised due to legal protection of enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruption action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">Procurement documentation was not always complete or completely credible for controlled contracting entities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always adequately observed in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some found deficiencies decreased the preventive anti-corruption function of documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their notification duties (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, supply and services in order to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures on the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (review directive), with these two directives being transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The EU general procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or a discrimination; a requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include the directive on the coordination of procedures for public procurement includes provisions on construction projects whose total expected value is or exceeds 5 miles. €.</seg>
<seg id="120">These clauses affect: Content documentation content; type of procurement used; publication of certain information before, during and after the end of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for acceptance of tenders; qualifying requirements that may be required of tenderers; criteria for the selection of the most suitable offer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of applicants follows the review proceedings directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of the procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority reviewed according to review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">There is no legal definition in any of both countries what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is seen as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position in its own favor.</seg>
<seg id="128">Usually this means that such abuse is incited by persons who gain benefit.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">According to estimates, the total corruption related damage accounts for 5 % of the world's economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1 % of the EU's economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="132">If a contracting authority is involved in the contract, conventions limiting competition or allowing dishonest conduct can weaken confidence in integrity, ability and overall work of public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, prevention of corruption is an essential task of contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practice and procedures must be controlled especially in areas particularly prone to corruption in order to allow adequate measures to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective checks can significantly reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">Procurement of works contracts is usually considered to be particularly prone to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Corruption prevention measures</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which concerns active and passive bribery, accepting and offering significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German Federal Government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis: priority of open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision making; division of planning, procurement and accounting phase; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">Moreover, other measures with preventive influence against corruption became part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology established a system for monitoring contract for construction of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total value of the contract and the involvement of private projections offices can be fully recorded and analyzed to detect possible irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, the level of employment or civil law is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="144">Legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and no discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were established by the government in the ′′ Government's strategy to fight corruption for the period 2011 to 2012 ′′ updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of the said measures were incorporated into the public procurement law and follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">New legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering limits for small-scale contracts; obligation to prior notice by the contracting authority including justification of the contract; prohibition to limit the number of tenderers in a narrower procedure and cancellation of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing; obligation to publish contracts including attachments; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of checks related to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documentation</seg>
<seg id="150">The procurement documentation must contain all the information needed to allow applicants to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documentation must allow the offer price to be processed.</seg>
<seg id="152">In order to do this, applicants must not be exposed to risks they could not expect.</seg>
<seg id="153">The specification of the contract documentation contains mainly specifications, and the requirements to demonstrate candidate s' qualifications and the criteria for choosing the best bid.</seg>
<seg id="154">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">European law contains in particular requirements regarding technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Specifications must limit competition to the least possible extent and all interested parties must have equal access to it.</seg>
<seg id="157">Specifications must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific products are allowed on a very limited scale in the procurement documentation.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of prevention of corruption is that the procurement documentation does not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Documentation should further avoid ambiguity or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation during the evaluation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="161">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that the specifications be given in general without reference to a particular product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">Specifications must define the required supplies and services accurately and indicate in detail the number of units of work and supply.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases prices should be reported according to units of work or supply (e.g. in CZK / m or CZK / item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Defining the required work in terms of their functionality is only acceptable in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">Basically, the rule is that the specifications need to be prepared completely and unequivocally.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain accurate amounts and must not include work and deliveries, the necessity of which is not quite obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payment in the form of flat-rate amounts or according to the time worked must be avoided wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documentation must exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">Specifications must allow each candidate to prepare their offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender must be published only when the procurement documentation is complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contractors to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts, provided that the nature of the subject matter of such a contract.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule to divide works into parts, either quantitatively (partial supply) or according to special aspects (specialized parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows small and medium-sized entities to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential applicants and makes price fixation difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of assignment is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, the procurement documents must contain evaluation criteria for national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the candidate in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner of the criteria according to which his offer will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement for evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European calls for tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the contract documentation is prepared by authorized independent experts, German regulations require any information from it to help identify specific interested companies, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from acquiring any additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the knowledge of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents regarding tenders and allow their accessibility for verification.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only focal point for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic currently does not have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, after the original contract is concluded, there will almost always be a need for more work or modification of existing works.</seg>
<seg id="190">Legislative of both countries allows a multi-work contract to a certain limit to the same supplier without publishing and implementing a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of multiple work under European and German legislation must not exceed 50 % of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, more work must be necessary and must have the nature of a special component of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20 % is applied to the assignment of multiple work.</seg>
<seg id="194">This can bring the risk of more time delay in the execution of the contract and possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">If a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents suppliers from arbitrary increase in the price of modified works or multiple works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be made taking into account prices negotiated in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to multiple works, less work can occur during construction, i.e. jobs that were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">Less work and more work cannot be compensated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main inspection findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to bid</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, the specifications were referring to national technical requirements or standards, but were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases the specifications included data demanding a certain brand, e.g. for the system of resilience of public inscriptions, to prevent water breach or for noise tiling, although it was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantitative specifications divided into items</seg>
<seg id="206">BRH has not observed a disagreement with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supply and services according to the quantitative specifications divided into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Complete of the specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most cases controlled, tendering documents were prepared without the rest before the invitation to tender was announced.</seg>
<seg id="209">However, in various cases, documents during the procurement procedure had to be modified when changes in items or timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, the contract documents contained work and deliveries needed insecure.</seg>
<seg id="211">One procurement documentation for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Dividing the contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the desired justification for not to divide the supply into parts has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">The criteria for evaluating tenders before the contract award, BRH found no shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of names of authorized independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">In many documents, interested authorized experts were presented.</seg>
<seg id="217">Names were listed on the opening pages of documents or on plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even urged tenderers to contact an explicitly named architect with their procurement questions.</seg>
<seg id="219">These cases were found mainly in procurement documentation, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the processing of the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">Contracting authorities stated that they did not have sufficient staff capacity to check the procurement documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to bid</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract to build a house with 12 apartments, there was a link directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority has not allowed the use of other similar product types or justified why it calls for the delivery of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of the university facility, the procurement documentation contained links to specific business companies and specific product designations.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overview of the specifications and sub-specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define the quantity and type of required works, supplies or services in the statement and established only the built-in space in cubic meters for each building as a unit.</seg>
<seg id="228">Complete of the specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the procurement documentation for closer proceedings was changed four times from August to September 2009</seg>
<seg id="230">The reason was the changes in project documentation caused by extension of the scope of the contract and by changing technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the construction of social objects, the procurement documentation had defects, which forced the creation of multiple work (precise focus was missing, sufficient construction research was not done, drawings were missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">The contract documentation for the construction of a large library stated interior elements only descriptively, without specification of quality product requirements.</seg>
<seg id="233">Delivery of the interior of the building was provided by subcontractors, who bought some superior and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for awarding the contract</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award a contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">Analysis of three large road buildings during the construction of the road circuit showed that savings of up to 790 miles were possible when they were awarded in open proceedings (separately after selected objects). Kč from the price of public procurement achieved 15 508 miles...</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, six building objects as a separate part of the public contract could have been a savings of 62,5 miles.</seg>
<seg id="238">Kč, i.e. 25 % of the contrasted price and 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract could have been a savings of 287,8 miles. Kč, i.e. also 25 %.</seg>
<seg id="239">The contracting authority established qualification criteria during the construction of road roads in the procurement documentation, which restricted the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the contract conditions of open procedure for the contractor at one highway construction construction, the contracting authority requested, inter alia. contractor's practice consisting of the implementation of at least three road buildings with a financial volume of more than 700 miles each. Kč, completed or working in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of buildings over 700 miles. Kč in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of another highway construction in an open procedure included six separate buildings, for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of construction works in the last three years of 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. i.e. 2.5 billion out of of 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 orders for a total of 13,2 billion. Kč there were only two or even one candidate.</seg>
<seg id="245">NKÚ pointed out that reducing market potential can lead to a huge increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Multiple work area</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, the contracting authority did not enter into a written contract for the delivery of multiple works of construction and did not enter into any of the procedures laid down in the law during the construction of the road circuit.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of pre-approved multiple work in one case was 1 591,4 miles. Kč without VAT (increase by 21 %) and in the second case 4 135,8 miles. Kč without VAT (increase of 91 %).</seg>
<seg id="249">The cause of multiple work was primarily ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">For the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include some work and supplies in the procurement documentation, which it already knew about the necessity for completion and housewarming of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and supplies, he made additions to the work contract with the construction contractor with the price increase, in the negotiated procedure without publication, although the volume of multiple works exceeded the national limit of 20 % of the original contract value.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the court palace, the contracting authority reserves the right to enter additional works without procurement.</seg>
<seg id="253">During construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by 50,5 miles...</seg>
<seg id="254">Unit prices of additional work established without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same supplier.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">NKÚ on a selected sample of buildings found that the average construction cost of building one kilometer of a four-current highway in the Czech Republic is 355,0 miles...</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometer section of the four-current highway is 260,0 miles...</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that buying a highway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions regarding the procurement documentation are almost identical in both countries and are in accordance with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The goal is to ensure complete and straight competition and prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">Specifications must be accurate enough to allow candidates to calculate costs and prepare their offers.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement restricts space for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to assign more work.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on procurement documentation are complemented by other rules to reduce the possibilities for limiting competition and for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this type in the Czech Republic, there is greater transparency achieved by publishing the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries, the specification requirements are mostly met.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases, weaknesses have been identified that could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The current rule in Germany demanding the division of large construction projects into parts seems suitable for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">NKÚ found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-scale projects without awarding parts or dividing into a large part of the volume of interested parties can limit a small number of large suppliers to small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">The result of the strict requirement for references of applicants, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of road works applicants, is that public contracts are awarded only to a small circle of tenderers, so small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of applicants also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal conventions.</seg>
<seg id="272">Regulatory approaches are different in both countries with regard to the award of additional contracts for multi-work or modified work.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the multi-work may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">The stricter limit of 20 % applies in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="275">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="277">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the 20 % limit is exceeded, multiple work must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing the work into part, it is possible to avoid limiting competition and subsequent unfortunate consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines a circle of potential suppliers who will be allowed into the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting authority may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited, or it may limit the scope according to the specified criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">In case of large project works whose value exceeds or exceeds the limits established by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing a type of procedure, the contracting authority must meet, in particular, the requirements of European law regarding competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works exceeds or exceeds the current EU limit of 5,0 miles. € (125 miles. Kč), open or limited procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competition dialogue is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="288">If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the European procurement procedure by issuing national proceedings if the total value of the relevant part is below 1,0 miles. € (25 miles. Kč) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20 % of the value of the whole contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or intentionally estimating its costs too low with the intention of avoiding the fundamental obligation to write a European procurement procedure is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="290">Choosing a type of management is very important for the prevention of corruption, because limiting competition significantly increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, an important part of the procurement documentation is a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, especially in relation to the application of the European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits to their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and narrower procedures and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and narrower proceedings can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are allowed only when the conditions laid down are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech amendment, the relevant German regime of budgetary law and the principle of corruption prevention prefers open proceedings or a public call for participation in proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings including limited management are only exceptionally permitted if legislation permits.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions must be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference for open proceedings is intended to guarantee that competition restrictions are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of procurement is the central point of prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">Proper estimate of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for a decision on the corresponding type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the costs of ground construction projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These were built on the basis of analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of buildings, construction units, parts and partial works.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the planned project or construction works contract.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public land construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, cost determinations are based on estimation of the project-financing entity or based on the value of the resources available to this entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Standardization measures are in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="312">Based on the anti-corruption program for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant Ministries are supposed to develop a database of the usual prices of standardized commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the subject line to the contract in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The price system should serve as a set of information on construction and installation works, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued regulatory prices for traffic buildings to check them, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is designed to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play comparative function in the next stages of construction work preparation.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main inspection findings BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">Controlled contracting entities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of ground construction was 59,5 %.</seg>
<seg id="321">This share was 94,8 % in road construction.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of an area inspection, BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16 000 proceedings, that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public management and public challenge and limited management also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, tenders in limited proceedings and negotiated procedures were between 6 % and 10 % higher than in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Control Court confirmed differences in value for money received in public and limited proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="327">A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in limited proceedings were twice the prices in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated to be more than 5 miles. € (125 miles. Kč), controlled contracting entities usually prepared procurement plans stating which works will be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of work awarded under European rules exceeded 80 % of the total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">No case of circumvention of the European management requirement in the form of an overrun low cost estimate has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases, the minimum percentage for pan-European management was not achieved due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the course of the work some contracting entities have illegally changed the contract award plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">These changes did not justify and demonstrate that the minimum share of European management was subsequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of European management according to project accounts was generally lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected value of construction projects contracts exceeded the European limits, contracting entities did not apply European proceedings to all individual parts worth more than 1 miles. € (25 miles..).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of national proceedings without giving compelling reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of the type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">For several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a large sporting event and housing construction) the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division decreased the expected value of the contract and the contract was awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the law regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods for calculating the expected price</seg>
<seg id="343">Price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices shown in final proceedings, but were burdened by non-economic and excessive suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">NKÚ found that the actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37 % lower than these price normatives.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is supposed to update normatives in relation not only to past prices, but also compared to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For ground buildings, the expected price was based on the project budget performed by architects or an investor estimation.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price was then significantly different from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The expected price of the construction of a large library was twice higher compared to the contract price, but increased by 54 miles during the implementation. Kč, i.e. by 27 %.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depositary of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased even during the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">The construction of a large library was 400 miles. Kč, i.e. by 22 %. For the construction of the judicial palace, the actual price increased disproportionately (by 139 %) compared to the increase in functional areas (only 12 %).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries implemented European rules on the choice of procurement type and respecting European limits to their national legislation, so the relevant national adjustments of both countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">The principle of public proceedings in Germany is, however, stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the narrower procurement procedure, the public procedure or the public call for participation of more competitors to participate in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of tenders that guarantee the best value effect for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the circle of candidates is not limited by decisions taken by the contracting authority, which gives room for manipulation and price fixation among tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="359">The study confirmed the benefits of the German provision on the preference of open proceedings or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contracting entities to award contracts in open or narrower proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest regulation of the public procurement law imposes a ban for contracting authorities to restrict the number of tenderers in narrower proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="362">The narrower procedure has now become very close to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authority is largely fulfilled the requirement of a preference for open proceedings or a public invitation to participate in the competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided against the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to select the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects implemented in Germany, the European limits were not respected, which resulted in a minimum share in pan-European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="365">A satisfactory system has not yet been introduced in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">In cases where on site, contracting entities should ensure through more extensive checks that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of the contracts awarded in European procedures are met or should create the conditions necessary to allow proper calculation of the expected costs I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and procurement notice are an important base for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">Through preliminary notifications, the contracting authority must state the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary notifications are required for projects for which the total cost estimation is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for submitting tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority is required to publish a procurement notice with detailed information on all public procurement required by the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information is binding upon the contracting authority after publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notice shall contain specifications, time limits for proceedings and for completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weights.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common vocabulary for public procurement must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and contract notice are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the contracting authority profile.</seg>
<seg id="378">Due to prevent discrimination against foreign candidates, no national notices should contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the EU Publications Office is sent.</seg>

<seg id="380">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.</seg>

<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic preliminary information and notice must be published even in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">The procurement procedure shall not be opened before one month after the preliminary notice has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="386">Preliminary disclosure may only be waived in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany preliminary information is not required in cases where European proceedings are not required.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the Federal Government's website and, when appropriate, in print.</seg>
<seg id="389">In case of limited proceedings without competition from participants, the notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or greater than 000 25 (625 thousand..).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the amount of small contracts in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="397">In some open proceedings they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between sending a preliminary notice and sending a contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other abbreviated proceedings, the annual deadline for preliminary information expired and should be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the preliminary notice did not indicate the projected division of construction works into multiple parts.</seg>

<seg id="412">The reduction of the number of offers was made possible by previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">During the construction of a road circuit, the contracting authority did not define in the notice of initiation of a narrower procedure or in the qualifying documentation of the value according to which it will assess the level of compliance with the qualifying criteria and the number of applicants who will be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority evaluated the completion of the qualification by fulfilling it all six candidates in the context of the narrower procedure, but excluded one of them from fulfilling it only in the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent because it did not publish information in advance on what will be evaluated from the qualification data and how.</seg>

<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information process with preliminary information and publication of the notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements for transparency and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of limited procedures, both countries increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in limited procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Compared to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow participation to all potential interested applicants.</seg>
<seg id="423">In limited procedures, the contracting authority will first select potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow to limit the number of applicants in European limited procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, limited proceedings require at least five tenderers to be invited to submit an offer and in case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of challenged applicants must be wide enough to guarantee real competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">Selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">Selecting potential applicants to be challenged is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preference of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to several applicants can make their secret agreement easier.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the driving.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority needs to take measures to prevent manipulation and make sure it has effective control to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for selection of applicants are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting entities should change tenderers inviting to submit their tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not acceptable to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities must document and justify candidate selection and selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, it is required to invite at least three applicants in case of limited proceedings and several suitable applicants in the case of a negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except for two cases, new Czech regulations do not allow the number of applicants to be reached in case of narrower and negotiated proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany it is necessary to respect the ′′ principle of four eyes ′′ when selecting applicants.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes their list, another has to substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by crossing out the proposed candidate or adding another candidate.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is supposed to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively define a circle of applicants to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="445">If such a provision is not introduced, a far-reaching illegal agreement between participants is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender must be confidential and must not be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="447">This also gives a commitment to authorized independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor a measure for confidential treatment of the list of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under German clauses, they must not define candidates for an external company, but they can make suggestions to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main inspection findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">In addition to several cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of applicants was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of nearly 7 000 national-limit construction assignments showed that in the case of limited proceedings, contracting entities invited an average of 6,6 potential tenderers and in the case of direct negotiation proceedings, an average of 4,4 tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Contracting entities especially in the area of building buildings did not change the circle of approached applicants because they had good experience with those with whom they worked so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">Contracting entities argued that in case of non-public proceedings they should guarantee that they would address the tenderers whose suitability they had already assured beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the circuit of applicants in the non-public proceedings included a larger part of regional applicants than in the case of public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="461">Contracting authorities explained this the low level of the contract compared to public management and high cost of travel for potential tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="462">The principle of cross-check and design of self-employed experts</seg>
<seg id="463">Contracting entities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of tenderers proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">They argued especially with lack of staff, time pressure or inappropriate knowledge of a suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, it was not evident from the records who suggested the candidate who was asked to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="466">Checking some samples showed that the list of potential applicants was created by self-employed professionals and the contracting authority was accepted unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, contracting entities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of handling lists of potential applicants</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority had a list of tenderers for invitation to the procurement procedure in the database, which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed manipulation or unauthorized disclosure of the names of expected or accepted applicants, who could then agree on the price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation gave reasons for choosing applicants in only a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="474">Applicant selection criteria</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the road circuit, the candidates did not have information about what will be evaluated from the data on their qualifications and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">The action related to the development and modernization of waterways and ports in the procurement notice for participation in a narrower procedure did not define the criteria for restrictions on the number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met qualifying conditions, but thus exceeded the number to which the contracting authority limited participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then made the selection of applicants using the method of random selection - by drawing, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have been specified as a criterion already in the procurement notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">Due to the high risk of manipulation in selecting a winning candidate in limited procurement procedures, both countries introduced special measures to prevent illegal restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation using the so-called. cross-checks (four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidential character of the list of applicants and by prohibiting proposing to select applicants for external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the inspection found that part of the said rules were not sufficiently applied and that inadmissible restrictions on the candidate s' circle were not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting entities are obliged to eliminate all the deficiencies mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase in which potential tenderers can draw up tenders based on the tender documentation they received starts with publication of the procurement information and / or the invitation to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the date of opening the envelopes, applicants may submit their tenders to the contracting authority and thus apply for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority must follow national rules governing this stage of proceedings and prevent potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">The abovementioned rules apply in particular to organizing and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle applies that tendency documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their offer must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Projection offices that are involved in proceedings should not fulfil this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of uncertainty in the procurement documentation or further questions arise, only the contracting authority may provide information to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices responsible for drawing up the procurement documentation cannot provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">Any contact between projection office and applicants must be prevented throughout this phase.</seg>
<seg id="501">Those must remain anonymous throughout the course, because allowing contact with them can adversely affect the competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically submitted offers must be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services to print and send documentation, with their employees being obliged to comply with confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the tenders received must be marked indicating the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in its original state (sealed) to the official responsible for their custody.</seg>
<seg id="507">This worker must not be involved in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">Bids received must be locked up until the envelopes are opened.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall issue a report with competition details including the tender number and information on the draft and receipt of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no special regulations on the safekeeping of offers.</seg>

<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">BRH checked the assignment of the administration building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Sending procurement documentation</seg>
<seg id="516">Controlled contracting authorities of the construction administration sent out the procurement documentation either directly or entrusted it with printing and distribution to an external company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Self-employed persons sent no documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information provided to applicants</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the procurement documentation concerning inquiry and information, the contracting authority did not follow the rules for separate planning from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his contact staff, but rather the workers of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some procurement notices even included names of companies or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the procurement documentation.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, tenderers who asked questions during the procurement did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Offer tagging</seg>
<seg id="524">For contracting entities all accepted tenders were marked with a stamp and a receipt certificate.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed experts, violating the rule of one corruption prevention construction.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">With one contracting authority, offers were temporarily placed in an open compartment of the mailroom, which was accessed by all employees.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed a box in the hallway without constant supervision and part of the offers thrown into the mailbox stayed there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The box opening was wide and unsecured, so it was accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="532">NKÚ has not identified shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries rules are laid down to prevent contacts especially between stakeholders and design offices cooperating in procurement procedures throughout the entire process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all applicants.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are suitable for receipt, storage and confidentiality of offers.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, the accumulated control records have demonstrated violation of the rules in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="544">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national law and regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the whole procurement procedure.</seg>

<seg id="553">When opening all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Late offers received must not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency in opening envelopes, this phase including the conclusions (results) must be recorded in writing. The record must include, among other things, the names of applicants and prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The registration must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The registration may be signed by the applicants present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="559">A commission is set up in the Czech Republic for opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">Participation of independent experts is admitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Members of the commission may be responsible for discussing even in subsequent stages of the proceedings, i.e. by evaluating offers.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the leader and the recorder.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and in the case of ground construction and the recorder must not be participants in the preparatory phase (production of the procurement documentation), must not decide on the award of the contract and may not be members during subsequent processing (proceedings) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require registration of opening envelopes to contain not only offer prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) signs, e.g. damaged envelopes upon receipt or late delivery.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, the registration purchased in addition to the offer prices must include an indication of the tender language and the signature authorization of the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="567">German regulations require that all parts of open envelopes be marked to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked in the form of perforation, must be held at the end of opening the envelopes as confidential (secret) and can only be made available to persons who continue to process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the candidate must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="571">They do not have this modification in Germany, and if a single offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.</seg>

<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">The principle of cross check</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of envelopes, contracting entities followed the principle of four eyes.</seg>
<seg id="576">There were always a leader and a recorder who was not intended for another role.</seg>
<seg id="577">However, in rare cases, in small negotiated procedures, the natural person opened the tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>

<seg id="587">During road repairs, the candidate's offer was handed over to the contracting authority with a monthly delay and he still accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">In both countries, the essential parts of the envelopes are identical with the principle of ′′ more eyes ′′ and the principle of transparency and therefore allow for significantly reducing the risk of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">Marketing, safe keeping and respecting the confidential nature of offers significantly limit the possibility of subsequent changes in the submitted tenders.</seg>
<seg id="592">In addition, workers responsible for opening envelopes must not carry out any other contract related activities.</seg>
<seg id="593">Discovery, despite some discrepancies, confirms that the rules for opening envelopes are mainly applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the specified deadline.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating offers in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step examines the suitability of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and required professional and technical knowledge and abilities.</seg>
<seg id="601">Candidates who have ever been legally convicted of bribery or defraudation must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Offers of non-excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of number of correctness, technical suitability and value for money based on previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable offer and especially check all the significantly low price offers.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and assessment is especially sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, applicants may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The result of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference of a candidate or his disadvantage, thus preventing the most economically advantageous offer.</seg>
<seg id="607">Therefore, the contracting authority must take special measures when selecting persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">They also need to make sure that the whole process and decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In accordance with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require review and evaluation of tenders in progressive steps.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements to demonstrate the suitability of the applicants, the evaluation criteria and their weights specified in the notice or in the procurement documentation shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria laid down for the assessment of the suitability of the applicants cannot be applied further.</seg>
<seg id="614">A further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">Offers submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view whether they are complete or not included suspicious elements that might encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the assessment of the tenders of the finding is disproportionately low bid price, the candidate concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before possible withdrawal of his offer.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, tenderers must remain confidential and only eligible persons can participate in the evaluation of offers.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority can review the mathematical accuracy of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the contractor's selection or the project implementation phase may be entrusted with the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with examining and evaluating offers, they must realize that offers are confidential and respect that fact honestly.</seg>
<seg id="625">They can only give the contracting authority suggestions for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by the commissioning authority, which will draw up a report with the proposal for a contract conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If in Germany the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If applicants fail to comply with this obligation, their offers must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority can decide whether it will give the candidate an opportunity to supplement the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the candidate does not support them, they must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany it is necessary to review not only the total price, but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the offer shows that prices for parts of the overall project were estimated disproportionately high or low, applicants must be asked for clarifications.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such offers must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This should prevent applicants from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that significant quantitative changes will be made for each part of the project, which can lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Appreciation compensation is not a reason to exclude an offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a candidate who offers disproportionately high or low price.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more offers differ price by 10 % or more compared to the price estimated by the contracting authority or by other tenders, tenderers must prove that their offer was plausible and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only offers with disproportionately low prices were received and tenderers did not justify these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not a reason for refusing to award the contractor concerned (unlike the German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If there is a suspicion of action in Germany to reduce competition, the contracting authority shall immediately report this fact to the competent supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">The candidate must decide on the next procedure and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or criminal law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">They also have to approve (e.g. when the contract exceeds 000 50 and the contract has not been awarded to the tenderer with the lowest bid) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>

<seg id="650">Appropriate examination and procurement criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most proven procurement procedures were in accordance with relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In case of some recommendations of potential suppliers made by self-employed persons, contracting entities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, procurement procedures were not sufficient documentation as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested persons and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting entities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of the construction authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">These were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that should have been held solely by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">Contracting entities sought to justify this fact with their lack of human resources in a given sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to examine offers of services of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and perform with proper care the execution of their contract commitments.</seg>
<seg id="660">As regards contracting entities, there was usually no evidence of whether offers in the custody of self-employed professionals were only available to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and mathematical check of offers</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first conducting a prescribed check of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these tests.</seg>
<seg id="663">In case of any intention of manipulation, third parties could make changes in tenders that could not be identified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="664">The examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the offers were not adequately identified or where price and product data were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A model inspection of one contracting authority revealed that in 75 % of the procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10 % from predetermined costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One of twenty procurement procedures were cancelled due to non-adequate tenders.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases there was lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of offers or deals with applicants for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was also missing e.g. on unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often stated as a reason for the derogation.</seg>
<seg id="671">Contracting entities defended that identifying and demonstrating compensatory prices was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting authority, a 66 % lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimation.</seg>
<seg id="673">No data on closer cost examination or finding reasons for variations were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping of the tenderer to whom the contract was potentially awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">Therefore, it was not clarified whether the original cost estimate was inflated or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority evaluated this candidate as a ′′ low cost company ′′ that was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to the tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the original cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the procurement procedure and stated the unfounded argument that the candidate concerned could be assumed that he did not base his price on excessive costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">One contracting authority found two cases of irregularities and reported to the company responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing an identical price calculation, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The checks showed no significant deficiencies in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Appropriate verification</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction events such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from participation in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority, or did not prove the qualification to the required extent, or on the contrary, one contracting authority failed to demonstrate or explain the reason for eliminating the candidate who met the requirements I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="686">Reviews</seg>
<seg id="687">Although the individual evaluation criteria of the contracting procedure for the construction of the sewage plant were established for the construction worker, the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For railway infrastructure development action, the evaluation criteria were not established at the start of the procedure, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the evaluation of the 'reduction of construction time' criterion was not done correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For applicants in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly reported a larger reduction in the construction period than stated in their offers.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for choosing the candidate</seg>
<seg id="692">The contracting authority failed to demonstrate for three housing support actions, based on which criteria it assessed the accepted tenders and how it chose the most suitable of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">Properity of selection of contractors of small-scale contracts associated with road circuit construction with the expected price up to 500 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="694">Kč could not be verified, because suppliers were selected only based on telephone consultations on price and date of fulfilment, but documents of these negotiations were not made out.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, rules for verifying and evaluating offers correspond to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with regard to specific management and choice of individuals in the proceedings included.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps of the procurement process follow stricter and more detailed requirements, especially in terms of the application of the cross principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, checks found in some cases that substantial steps of the process in verifying and evaluating tenders were not documented at all and if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">Absence of control tools and transparency in taking decisions during reviewing and evaluating tenders allows manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">The checks showed serious defects, such as the submission of tenders to third parties without prior proper examination and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting entities entrust a third party to carry out the functions of examination and evaluation of tenders, adequate measures and increased control of measures against increased manipulation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In all cases, controlled German contracting entities did not use the complete set of available tools and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, shortcomings were found in the assessment of the suitability of offers and the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After examination and evaluation of tenders, the procurement process is completed by awarding a contract or cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of European proceedings, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision on awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="710">Contractors have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited time limit of 10 or 15 days and request a review if applicable.</seg>
<seg id="711">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The 10 days period applies to electronic submissions and 15 days for other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract must not be concluded before this period or before the decision of the review procedure is taken.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law examined by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by rapid implementation of the procurement decision.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority must properly document the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries implemented on informational management duties.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure lies with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, this one cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of the proper examination and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is supposed to contract within the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reason is because the tenderer is not bound by his offer after this period.</seg>
<seg id="724">Content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful applicants should be informed of the outcome in time, stating the reason why their offer was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">The cancellation of the procurement procedure is only allowed when certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the offers do not meet the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different clauses</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of the contract of 10 or 15 days applies to European and national proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other proceedings in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before a decision on its EU provision and review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only one offer complied with the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">The contract must be awarded in Germany, even though a single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions laid down in the procurement documentation and is cost effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main inspection findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The checks found few discrepancies in completing the controlled procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases of European proceedings, the companies empowered letters before the expiry of the notification deadline, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">In several cases of open proceedings, authorizing letters of modification included incompatible with the content of the tenders, e.g. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases contracting entities did not comply with the deadline for awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority chose the second most favorable offer, because the candidate offering a price more than 50 % lower did not wish to meet the contract at the originally offered price.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">During the reconstruction and construction of the college, the contracting authority did not enter into a contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the offer of the selected candidate.</seg>
<seg id="742">Some road repair and maintenance events, highway construction and road circuit construction contracts were concluded later than the law provides.</seg>
<seg id="743">The contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable offer to all tenderers after the legal deadline expires, for construction adjustments in former military újezdech.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries implemented EU regulations on termination of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection of failed candidates contributes to the reduction of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the Institute of Legal Protection also in cases of contracts below the EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that a limited time limit for contract closure was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings when closing the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information duties</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process with all its individual phases, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, must be documented in a transparent way.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">The data on procurement procedures are summarized in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Demands of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in accordance with the essential requirement of the principle of transparency applied at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process, and above all guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each candidate in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, since the obligation to substantiate individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the space for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must announce their completion of the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and thus fulfils the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarize the essential information on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics, which allow for an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>

<seg id="799">The checks revealed shortcomings significantly lowering the value of documentation as a means of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="800">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel checks of NKÚ and BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the process of procurement both in the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU Legislative gives opportunity to international competition within the EU to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">The aim of measures to prevent corruption is not only to avoid it or at least reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The sought inspection findings of both control institutions - NKÚ and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement right of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of common and different elements that can help both countries in the further development and application of this right.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries transposed EU law regarding public procurement into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">Thus, there is an important common basis in both countries for public procurement and fulfilling essential requirements in the area of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting entities reinforce these requirements with partially very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has raised public procurement clauses requiring European management and procedures that are below EU limits and therefore governs national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, checks showed that contracting entities do not always fully comply with all relevant EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures to eliminate the mentioned irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, checks identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">In particular, this is an incomplete definition of the subject-matter of a public contract resulting in additional works, which were often awarded against the law, insufficient definition of the expected price and also the required qualifying assumptions narrowing the possible circuit of tenderers and thus reducing competition especially in the field of transport buildings.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint checks were not intended to detect corruption cases.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both BRH and NKÚ do not have the tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can verify whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulate during public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In terms of corruption prevention, both countries focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">The German provisions mainly give space to wide and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="822">Czech regulations mainly monitor the strengthening of the transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany there are general principles of corruption prevention that apply to the whole Federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles were also incorporated among the public procurement requirements and were adopted to meet the specific needs of these procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes very precisely, ways to comply with the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and the choice of persons included therein.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the opinion of the BRH, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate instrument for substantial reduction of the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate control (especially the principle of cross control), requirements regarding transparency, procurement documentation and various organisational measures are also an effective mechanism to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">Therefore, BRH does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with during the award of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting entities should provide their employees with further education and thus inform them with anti-corruption requirements and further increase their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the exposed weaknesses applies to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls in delegation of powers increases the risk of their abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Consequently, manipulation and corruption activities should only be transmitted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorized intervention.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">In the Czech Republic anti-corruption strategies were adopted at the government level, which also significantly affect the public procurement area.</seg>
<seg id="838">NKÚ control events took place during the implementation of one of the most important parts of this strategy, a significant change in the public procurement law and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">Strategy adopted and new laws can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">According to new regulations, for example, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the contract, the determination of the expected value of the contract, the adequacy of requirements for qualifying assumptions, the determination of basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders and the proper improvement and publication of everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendation</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both NKÚ and BRH have a positive opinion on the ways of implementing EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their wide application in practice confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">A multinational model established in the EU can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and supporting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damage caused as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection with the award of public procurement, both BRH and NKÚ insist that it is the responsibility of contracting entities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and improve them wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">Especially organisational structures and procurement processes should be monitored continuously in terms of weaknesses and risks to identify and respond appropriately to the need for repair actions.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to the practice in Germany, it appeared that the share of open procurement procedures should increase in the Czech Republic, which give space to competition and significantly reduce the possibility of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="848">Procurement in parts can also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where it is admissible and suitable for contracting entities. The higher number of applicants puts pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The influence on the procurement procedure is also provided by his organization.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organizations, while in the Czech Republic, except for transport buildings, central authorities organize it themselves or through contractors.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both NKÚ and BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where it is in place and address them with their parliament and government beyond their common project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they believe that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Highest Supervisory Institutions (INTOSAI), because these principles and findings are of general importance for effective countering corruption and guarantee, that public procurement is awarded in a regime of well functioning and honest competition and that value is achieved for money.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Joint Report submitted informs about the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel checks carried out by the Slovak Republic's Supreme Supervisory Authority and the Czech Republic's Supervisory Authority, with a focus on the management of excise taxes in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the top control institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the NKÚ SR and the NKÚ Czech Republic in the performance of parallel inspections focused on the management of excise taxes, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel checks was selected based on the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation to find out how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax management system is set up and how the systems in SR and the Czech Republic are different.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out was exchanging experience, identifying differences and finding good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, it was beneficial to find that international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty management is very limited without parallel checks being carried out.</seg>

<seg id="18">on the results of parallel checks of SPD management in SR and Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the SR and their administration is in accordance with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences were found between the adjustment of excise duties in SR and Czech Republic, in the Czech Republic contributes to the effective management of excise duties verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issuance of permits and compulsory marking and coloring of selected mineral oils and some other oils; in SR the distribution of control signs is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdened by the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against excise tax evasion, the supervision of raw tobacco movement and or as a good practice in both countries. tobacco raw materials, implementation of the Institute of Fuel Distributor and registration of retailers of alcohol packaging.</seg>
<seg id="23">Excise tax revenue in SR and Czech Republic grows slower than other tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="24">EU goals consisting of reducing labour taxation, introducing ecologically economical measures and reducing tobacco and alcohol addiction have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and SR, among others. also because there is no indexation of excise duty rates in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This results in reducing the importance of excise taxes on total tax revenue and due to increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in tax burden with excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="26">The state has long-term support for the implementation of environmental measures, but these measures have a negative impact on excise tax revenue, which will need to be replaced by other revenue or reducing state spending.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative costs incurred on the management of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and the SR have been growing long-term, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">In SR, this effectiveness is negatively affected by the costs of electronization of excise duty management (IT expenditure) and the costs incurred on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">Electronization of the management of excise taxes in SR did not significantly improve the number of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR recommend doporučují SR to rethink the justification of the performance of permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenses was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the controlled period, which would lead to a reduction in the staffing of the excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrators was similar in SR and the Czech Republic in the various years of the controlled period, but the number of comparable tax entities is about a third lower in SR than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in SR perform administrative actions mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax oversight, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote oversight and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The management of excise taxes in SR is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and due to the ratio of the number of tax operations to the number of entities and more costly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Electronization of excise duty management in SR and Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In SR, the administration of tax returns for excise duties is fully electronized, documents demonstrating taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronization support effective management of excise taxes and therefore NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure on the implementation of the EMCS system could not be compared as the FG SR provided spending data only for the system upgrade in the period 2011-2015, but the costs were incurred even before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenditure incurred during this period only for the EMCS upgrade was about 20 % higher in the SR than the costs incurred in the Czech Republic both on the introduction of EMCS and on the upgrade of this system in over ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and SR did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when comparable spending was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervisory is comparable in both countries, but in the SR, the management of excise taxes is significantly more resource demanding.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) has been streamlined by the management of excise duties, but in SR to a lower extent, because significantly higher costs were incurred than in the Czech Republic on the introduction of the system and its modernization.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation of both supervisory institutions was carried out under the Cooperation Treaty on the implementation of parallel checks aimed at the management of excise duties on 18. 8. 2015.</seg>

<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel checks were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the object and the aim of parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of parallel checks was to compare the performance of excise tax administrators, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and identifying weaknesses of the excise tax management process.</seg>

<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Reduction of sales of tobacco products with old tax rate</seg>
<seg id="203">The Czech Republic has introduced restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with effect from 1. 1. 12. 2014 tobacco products with an old tax rate in case of change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">The excise duty on tobacco products is paid by using tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco sticker means placing it on a unit package (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the use of the excise duty rate, the production of a tobacco product in a state intended for the final consumer is determined, without removing, supplying, dispatching or selling to the final consumer.</seg>

<seg id="211">Raw tobacco tax</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the abuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without the permission of the tax administrator and non-taxation, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco was introduced as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">Effective from 1. 7. 2015 excise duty is subject to raw tobacco not used or delivered for the manufacture of tobacco products to another Member State or third country or for which origin, purpose of use or person to whom it was not proven or raw tobacco should be supplied.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on handling raw tobacco</seg>

<seg id="226">Excise tax legislation in SR</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating excise duty area in SR is based on EU legislation, thus co-creating its uniform tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Individual types of excise duties are taxatively determined by the legislation of the SR, which is similar to the legislation of surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in SR</seg>
<seg id="230">Legislative adjustment of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to individual subjects of taxation.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonization was achieved by passing the following excise duty laws: Act No. 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, law no. 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, law no. 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, law no. 609/2007 Z. z., about excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All excise duty laws constitute statutes of material law and deal with taxation of the subject matter in tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No. 563/2009 Z. z., about tax administration (tax order), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates tax management, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework transposed the various provisions of Council Directive 2008/118 / EC of 16. December 2008 on general excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12 / EEC and transposed by it as well as the provisions of other directives and legislation European Community.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of amendments to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of control in SR</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, legislation on the management of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS system, monitoring of the transport of selected excise products under excise duty suspension regime was changed from a documentary accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where these transports are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Under the EMCS electronic system, the institute of suspending access to tax entities was introduced in 2015</seg>
<seg id="239">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the opportunity to suspend access just because of a reasoned fear of the outstanding or undetermined tax on previous taxation periods and its unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This applies to the maturity of the tax because the transport of excise goods requires the composition of collateral, which is released by termination of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A fundamental change in the management of the excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the option of using the so-called was cancelled. red diesel.</seg>
<seg id="244">The marked gas oil, commonly called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past red diesel has been used for specific law-defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture and its use was favoured by lower excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the income part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of repealing red diesel was to reduce the government deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden of the business entities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012 a new type of tax entity was created, namely the fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this statutory amendment was to introduce a registration obligation for all gas stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">Clarity of movement of taxed petrol and diesel is bound to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from the fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">New institutes of fiscal entities were introduced in 2014, namely the distributor of fuels and fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion in petrol and diesel and cleared the movement of these propulsion agents (see Annex No. 4, scheme A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, lawful provisions on the registration of tax operators dealing with lubrication and essential oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">However, in SR these mineral oils are not subject to an indication obligation.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">In the fight against tax evasion and monitoring tobacco raw material, the scope of the tobacco law has been expanded and a new tax entity - a tobacco trader was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonized tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">The obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">Legislative brought a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the labelling of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The check mark is for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the customer of the control stamps must request the customs office to issue inspection marks electronically, via the information system for inspection signs.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax operator and the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state printer of control signs was established - in Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of tax supervision of the print of inspection signs was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">Changes have contributed significantly to eliminating tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system of printing control signs strengthens the system of goods control, because the control mark generates a unique identification number, which can simply be verified whether the goods originate from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">Unique 8. digit identification number (1.- 2. place is the check sum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a pack of packages; 4. place is the identifier of the series; 5.- 8. the place is an alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.- 12. place is a decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of two dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes must further indicate the price of cigarettes, the sign for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in the packaging and the length of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise tax on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change touched alcohol, wine and beer, because the original three materials were abolished and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was developed mainly due to the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxation of alcoholic drinks, solutions to their production, movement monitoring, tax provision, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline tax administration, reduce administrative burden on small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of addressing the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform excise duty rate on an alcoholic drink and took into account the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">For non-sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented drinks, the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content of the final product is taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed in volume percentages of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small producer of fermented drinks has been introduced, the essence of exemption from excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented drink for their own consumption and for the consumption of their household not exceeding 1 liters per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">Legislative brought a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the labelling of the alcohol consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the customer of the control stamps must request the customs office to issue inspection marks electronically, via the information system for inspection signs.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax operator and the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state printer of control signs was established - in Kremnice Mint.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of tax supervision of the print of inspection signs was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">Changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex No. 4, Scheme B) and elimination of falsification of control signs.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system of printing control signs strengthens the system of goods control, because the control mark generates a unique identification number, which can simply be verified whether the goods originate from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">Unique 8. digit identification number (1.- 2. place is the check sum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a pack of packages; 4. place is the identifier of the series; 5.- 8. the place is an alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.- 12. place is a decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of two dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise taxes on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beers, wines and intermediates are regulated by one common law in the Czech Republic. 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Solid fuel tax, natural gas tax and some other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In contrast, in SR, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the excise duty on alcoholic beverages, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">Special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, since 1. June 1., the issuance of an authorization for the handling of excise products under the excise duty law is conditional, among other things, on the basis of the evidence of the economic stability of the applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to abandon or reduce tax security.</seg>
<seg id="292">FG SR exercises tax supervision in the form of a staff member of the Financial Directorate over the handling of inspection signs for alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sales to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law provides that the state company Mint Kremnica secures the production of control signs.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control bands in the Czech Republic is not introduced in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken over from the printer by the designated territorial workplace of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, control bands for alcohol marking are distributed to individual local tax administrators according to the point of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturer of tobacco stickers and control bands.</seg>
<seg id="298">In SR there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products or parts thereof, such an obligation is not introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker carries excise duty on tobacco products, paid when collecting tobacco stickers at the designated customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">On the other hand, the SRR does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, the refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced during the controlled period, in case of their use for primary agricultural plant production, so-called. green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to animal production.</seg>
<seg id="303">Such support for farmers is not introduced in SR (existed until 12. 31. 2010 as the so-called. red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a bail of 20 miles was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. CZK (i.e. 740 thousand. €).</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. decrease by 1 717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">In SR, a similar institute of a fuel distributor is introduced, but without making the bail needed to secure the excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">303 distributors registered in SR in 2014 and 407 distributors registered in 2015</seg>
<seg id="308">The Institute of Fuel Vendor and Fuel Consumer is introduced in SR, which is issued by the local competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils are subject to markings, in SR after the cancellation of the so-called. red diesel labelling of mineral oils is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and a-digit registration code, indicating the spirit drink, according to which the control belt registration is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be registered on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The belt holder is obliged to notify their use within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the SR, the control mark intended for the marking of alcohol in the consumer packaging contains a unique-digit identification number, which is communicated once a month to the tax administrator and serves to verify the authenticity of the check mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The registration contains the number of checks collected, used and relics.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Czech Republic and the SR instituted compulsory registrations, or. alcohol distributor's registration.</seg>
<seg id="317">In SR, registration is subject to compliance with conditions bound, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of a consumer packaging alcohol at least 100 000 or paid basic property of at least 100 €; minimum number 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, the acquisition of registration is conditional, among other things, on the basis of a deposit of CZK 5 000 (i.e. 185 000) for the benefit of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In SR, the permanent presence of the tax administrator is required in the production of alcohol not only in the consumer packaging.</seg>

<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and the SR exceeds the EU minimum requirements for the subject matter and management of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States and to the risks identified in tax areas.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted during the controlled period allow tax administrators to prevent possible tax evasion from developing.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and SR to combat tax evasion in the form of abuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves) an excise duty on raw tobacco or raw tobacco has been introduced beyond EU legislation. tobacco materials.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco are not a harmonized tobacco product, the Czech Republic and SR monitor their movement.</seg>
<seg id="327">NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR can recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">Good practice in the Czech Republic demonstrated that the examination of economic stability in applicants for authorization under the Excise Tax Act has been successful because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason both control institutions recommend applying such verification also in the conditions of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="330">Distribution of control stamps is more effective in SR than in the Czech Republic, because it does not burden customs authorities with costs related to transport between printer and customer of control bands and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The financial management of the SR has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, the collection of tobacco products tax is more effective in the Czech Republic, because the order of tobacco stickers itself is a tax return with subsequent tax payment.</seg>
<seg id="333">The financial management in the SR has improved overview of the places of fuel sales due to the introduction of the institutes of ' fuel seller ' and ' fuel consumer '.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of compulsory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the abuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or. tax exempt.</seg>
<seg id="335">A new control tape was introduced in the Czech Republic (2013) and in SR (2014). a sign containing an identification code.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the SR the new legislation has dropped its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">Impacts cannot yet be evaluated due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of the consumer packaging of alcohol by a control mark or the tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">NKÚ SR and NKÚ Czech Republic can recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">SR's attitude towards the conditions for distribution of alcohol characterizes a proclient approach that does not block tax entities funds.</seg>
<seg id="341">On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive because it introduces bail burden on tax entities cash flow, but reduces the risk of tax arrears more.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of excise tax revenue</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise tax is an indirect tax imposed by the state to increase state budget revenue and also regulate the quantity of goods sold, which is considered harmful to individuals and / or to the company (tax regulatory function).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Commission Communication: EUROPE 2020-Strategy for smart and sustainable growth promoting inclusion of 3. 3. under the flagship initiative Europe less resource demanding is the European Commission's intention to improve the framework for using market-based instruments, MJ. in the form of a revision of energy taxation focusing on reducing energy and resources consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EK's intention, Member States should try to shift tax burden from the workforce, among other things, to energy and ecological taxation.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of tax revenue from excise taxes in the Czech Republic and SR includes excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wines and intermediate products, natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise taxes in total tax revenue and the share of GDP is monitored, inter alia. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">The two top control institutions used the following selection criteria to enter the query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Excise tax collection in connection with macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise taxes in total tax revenue and the share of GDP according to OECD data decreased slightly.</seg>

<seg id="353">The reason was mainly the monetary policy decision of the CNB banking council of 7. November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">Results of excise tax debit, excise duty rates and per capita income in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">A significant reduction in the 2014 excise duty share was caused by a one-time outage of excise duty income on tobacco products due to the impact of the new legislation limiting the sale of old tax tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise taxes is also influenced by the increase in income tax recovery, which has increased significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">The total excise duty collection has the largest share of excise duty on mineral oils (about 55,7 % in 2015) but despite significant growth of the economy against 2012, it fell.</seg>
<seg id="358">The debit of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of ecologically economical vehicles and biofuels is negatively reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible share of natural gas tax, solid fuel tax and electricity tax, which is caused by a low tax rate compared to the surrounding countries, which is close to the minimum rates established by the EU.</seg>
<seg id="361">If there is no increase in tariffs, their share will in the future with regard to the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the reverberation of a large case of tax fraud consisting of putting taxless alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirit drinks.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, after taking a series of measures against such action and after reviving the liquor market, excise duty excise duty on alcohol exceeded 4 miles. €.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of tobacco product tax increased due to increasing rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic excise duty rates changed between 2012-2015 for the tobacco product tax, where the rate increased mainly due to the compliance of Council Directive 2011/64 / EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">Due to the currency intervention of CNB, the real rate of excise duty in €, apart from tobacco product tax, has dropped significantly. For tobacco products, it has risen slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or standard of living, the indexation of the excise duty rate is not set, so the function of excise duties consisting of regulation of socially problematic activities does not have to be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the growth of living standards, real excise tax rates are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation - automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity about inflation, this adjustment is based on a law or contract (for pensions paid by the state is called ad valorization).</seg>

<seg id="377">The second largest share is the excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">On average, this tax accounts for around 32 % of the total excise tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015 there was a growth in excise duty per capita of SR.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to an increase in the rates of excise taxes on tobacco products, higher acquisitions and higher population consumption in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The growth of excise tax debit per SR is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>

<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and SR in the total collection from the SPD is due mainly to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2,7 times in the Czech Republic or. 2,8 times higher, however, per one inhabitant of the Czech Republic is only about 1/3. higher for these selected products.</seg>
<seg id="384">The cause is the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower excise rates in the Czech Republic and the CZK course against vůči for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">For mineral oil tax, the cause is also greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a negligible influence.</seg>
<seg id="387">The evaluation of the real rate of excise duty in the Czech Republic due to CNB interventions decreased.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and SR in total tax revenue does not rise and there is no diverting from taxation of work to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the amount of excise duty achieved is permanently above average compared to the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The total excise tax debit is mainly influenced by changes in excise duty rates, economic condition and the behavior of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future excise tax recovery outages due to environmental measures subsidized by the state in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenue or reducing state spending.</seg>
<seg id="392">The fact that the indexation of excise duty rates is not introduced in the Czech Republic and SR, their regulatory functions decrease and the EU's aims of less dependent on ecologically unfriendly resources and reducing alcohol and tobacco addiction.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic shows higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is affected by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenses of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the relationship between spending and income related to the management of excise duties, i.e. Expresses the amount of expenditure for 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the effectiveness of administrative costs is.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of the tax manager in tax management affects the competence and organisational arrangement of the tax manager, management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">Determination of the effectiveness of administrative costs of tax management by the method of conversion rate is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in the liner-controlled structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is an independent organizational component of the state and an entity.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the Finance Administration of the Slovak Republic ensures tax management, with customs authorities being an internal organisational unit, costs and revenue being included in the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, due to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the management of excise duties in the calculation of the effectiveness of administrative costs, the costs and revenue of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of the management of excise duties in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The management of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="453">Salary expenses in SR are significantly influenced by the performance of permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses on alcohol, which the Czech Republic does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the management of excise duties increased significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, this growth was mainly due to increased wage spending and technical support costs.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, excise tax revenue grew at approximately the same rate.</seg>

<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and in SR, an important factor is the deteriorated effectiveness of administrative spending, which can be evaluated as natural developments.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining significant administrative demanding in the management of excise duties is a negative factor, confirming the non-decreasing number of employees in the field of excise duty management.</seg>

<seg id="569">The production period lasts from 1. 7. of the current year to 30. of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore, within one calendar year, a reduced tax rate can be applied to the produced alcohol multiple times, because the alcohol is produced in two manufacturing periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This is the production of alcohol outside the tax exemption regime, which means in practice that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower will pay the growers not only excise tax and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">Growing moonshine will issue a removal certificate to the grower, which serves not only as proof of origin and method of acquisition of alcohol, but also of payment of excise duty.</seg>

<seg id="577">The importer of the consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but CÚ gives him a certificate of inclusion in the registration of importers of the consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">This certificate authorizes the importer to import a consumer packaging of alcohol or a consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third state.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the checks marks, they must provide a tax guarantee for the amount of alcohol or cigarettes it wants to put into free tax circulation.</seg>

<seg id="609">The seller of propulsion is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep the registration of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for the calendar month and is also required to inform oznámit of a new supplier (distributor) of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="610">The seller of fuel is legally obliged to buy or otherwise collect fuel only from a distributor of fuel or from a registered person.</seg>

<seg id="613">This document shall include, in addition to quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the traffic inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, it is enough to demonstrate the method of acquisition of fuel an invoice that also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax manager in the territory of the SR during the tax oversight of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="616">First of all, it is an effort to avoid road checks during transport, so carriers use side roads, circumvent the toll selection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual transports.</seg>
<seg id="617">Transportation of mineral oils in rebuilt tankers with double day are also being carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times illegal transportation is accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change the route and avoid road control.</seg>

<seg id="651">Administrative operations in SR</seg>
<seg id="652">This subcap brings the tax supervision of excise tax management to selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in SR.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest annual increase in administrative operations (by 5,3 %) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, caused by more traffic in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="654">On the other hand, the biggest decrease was recorded annually in 2014, up to 4,3 % due to a smaller number of tax checks ended and a smaller number of tax returns filed.</seg>

<seg id="679">The Slovak Republic's accession to the European Union on 1. June 5. also made a change in the field of excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the management of alcohol excise duty, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative tools for more effective repression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with the management of excise taxes in 2004</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought by the new legislative amendment was not only the transition of the tax administrator in the field of excise duty management from tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administrator's presence in the tax warehouse to alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of SR, national legislation taxatively defines that it is possible to accept, issue, manufacture or process alcohol in tax warehouse only in the presence of a zaměstnance employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse that receives, stores or sends alcohol only in the packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, CÚ is obliged to secure employees in tax storage so that income, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol is not limited.</seg>

<seg id="689">If alcohol is not accepted, issued, produced or processed in the tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to secure the presence of an employee of the customs office, which is required to secure the space by closure of the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">However, in practice, this option is not often used because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators use the legal option within the meaning of Law No. 467/2002 Z. z., about the production and marketing of alcohol, and they use production equipment for the production of alcohol in distillery for growing burning and also for the purposes of distillery for distillates, which must be in tax storage.</seg>

<seg id="772">This increase was due to legislative change in the specified period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the contrary, the number of permits selected in 2013 decreased significantly due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative actions</seg>
<seg id="775">In the SR, substantive legislation provides for tax control duty on selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is specified by the internal control act issued by the FR SR due to the application of the uniform procedure of tax administrators in the territory of SR.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, material legislation does not modify tax control requirements, procedural law provides only the possibility of carrying out a check no later than the deadline for taxation.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and local investigations in SR and Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR determines in which cases and time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax check, while in the Czech Republic the amount of excise duty is correct or its return is verified especially by local inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="779">Since 2012, the number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased due to an increase in the number of transports in EMCS and at the same time due to an increase in the number of tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In SR, the number of administrative operations between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of EMCS transports and at the same time a decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">Different legislative arrangements have been shown on the large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrators was similar in the SR and Czech Republic in the various years of the controlled period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In SR, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same amount of administrative operations.</seg>
<seg id="785">From the above, it can be stated that the SR is more focused on the execution of administrative tasks by tax administrators, e.g. the exercise of physical tax oversight.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is placed on distant supervision, e.g. tracking device, immediate data transmission via web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronization of administrative operations</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax return can be filed via a data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">Customs administration of the Czech Republic introduced the so-called. interactive tax returns forms, which cannot be processed any longer.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must be further rewritten to the tax entity's personal tax account.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is to reduce the error rate of tax returns (DAP), which will save the tax administrator's actions related to the corrections of the wrong DAP filed.</seg>
<seg id="793">DGC is working on a new application for DAP electronic processing.</seg>
<seg id="794">Smart forms can further: tax applications or registration for activity and notification of changes in data, claim tax refund claims, fulfil notification requirements when handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco and fulfilling biofuels duties.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control bands is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registered entities to register by the tax administrator of specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under a tax exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic based on an electronic accompanying document implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transport of selected products in free tax circulation around the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of excise duty, decision of the customs office to release the selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision to measure excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is laid down by legislation.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for the issuing of alternative documents to facilitate the performance of these duties (§ 5 and § 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the documentary form of documents to replace or supplement electronically issued documents, which are sent to a data warehouse via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, where each such document is assigned a unique twelve-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">JIK serves for the purpose of inspection by customs authorities on the road and prevents repeated transportation on the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of the tax warehouse of fuel in the Czech Republic, which places about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, the CS Czech Republic has online access to the electronic registration system, where the body automatically deposits tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS Czech Republic is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. electronic system for registration and monitoring of transport of selected products in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should use 70 % of the current functional EMCS specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for declarant and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to the system of global guarantees, tax registry or risk analysis system.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should provide an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which is still working on the basis of written documents without registration and the sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current procedure for registration of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the abuse of a simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronization of administrative operations in SR</seg>
<seg id="810">In the management of excise duties, the SR financial administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in EMCS under the conditions of tax exemption, control signs, filing tax returns and also when tax entities register and registering.</seg>
<seg id="811">One-way electronic communication of tax entities with tax administrator was also introduced in 2014, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016</seg>
<seg id="812">Within electronic communications, the tax agency has accessible a personal internet zone, called after entering access data. an electronic personal box designed for communication with financial management.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the tax agency has access to the e-mailroom through which it submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents related to the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not concern all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities who are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">This is mainly a payer of value added tax, a tax advisor representing the tax body and attorneys representing the tax body.</seg>
<seg id="817">NKÚ SR also addressed the issue of the extent of the electronization of excise duty management during the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic operations, tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">If the EMCS traffic is taken away, there has been an increase in electronization of selected comparable administrative operations, which is also a requirement for modern tax management.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">Fully electronized processing of tax returns is already in place in SR, from its filing to registration of tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities to insert compulsory documents for individual transport in free tax circulation on the website.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the announcement of free tax circulation transport in the form and based on EMCS system is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax oversight, thus eliminating the transport of selected products, where excise duty has not been paid in violation of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">These can be recommended as a good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in SR in the field of tax return electronization, NKÚ SR and NKÚ Czech Republic recommend completing the electronization of tax returns in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organisational structure and personnel security in excise duty</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the SR has undergone major changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">Customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 is composed of the Directorate-General of Customs and Customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational agencies of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">DGC is an entity for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">Customs administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive management of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competences it ensures.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS Czech Republic continues to perform:</seg>

<seg id="846">(d) the activities of the police authority (designated customs authorities) in criminal proceedings committed by violations of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Czech Customs Administration is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the scope of competences (set of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there is a cost savings of the extent, because the public administration does not have to incur costs on the position of the control group for each subject of the inspection independently.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden of controlled persons is reduced by repeated inspection.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic continues to exercise its competence from 1. 12. 2016 to verify the performance of the duties in the registration of sales (§ 2 paragraph 2). Article 2 of Law No. 112/2016 Coll., on sales registration) and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of the operation of gambling, including penalties (Section 116 of Law No. 186/2016 Coll., about gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has changed the three-step structure to two-stage structure with effect from 1. 1. 2013, with the cancellation of the middle article of the procedure (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">DGC spent about 51 miles on the project. Kč (i.e. approx. 2 031 000 €).</seg>
<seg id="852">The CS Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 is DGC and regional customs offices, which are administrative and organizational components of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competence are laid down by law, the management of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through separation and territorial workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial workplaces are internal organizing units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to set up and disturb the territorial workplace and determine their factual competence.</seg>
<seg id="856">Legislation does not provide for any competence for the territorial workplace; the territorial workplace exercises the duties of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>

<seg id="861">The costs of CS Czech Republic significantly affect wage costs.</seg>
<seg id="862">Due to the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there was no saving of personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The execution of main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the Law on the service of security corps members.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility of reducing the number of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to the provisions of Section 42 (42). Article 1 of Law No. 361/2003 Coll., on the service of security corps members, can be released from the service only in cases of taxatively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of service posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure the allocation of adequate services within the corps and, where appropriate, to secure jobs with another security corps (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will put them in a deposit for the temporary non-inclusion, where members of security corps belong to 80 % of the average service income according to the law.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organizational arrangement of excise duty management in SR</seg>
<seg id="868">The Government of the Slovak Republic has established itself as one of the priorities of completion of tax administration reform through the UNITAS programme, which will secure additional budgetary resources by combining tax collection, customs and levies and suppression of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, tax reform was implemented at central level, which brought the merger of the SR Tax Directorate and the SR Customs Directorate into the SR Financial Directorate and the creation of financial management.</seg>
<seg id="870">FŘ SR was set up on 2012 1. 1. by law no. 333/2011 Z. z., about government agencies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as last amended, as a budgetary organization based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organizational structure of the financial management of the SR in 2015, apart from the FG SR, 74 organisational departments with a total of 1 employees; these services manage almost 48 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">In 2015, about 60 organizational departments with a total of 1 employees managed about 011 000 tax entities, which manage about 114 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual excise duty management activities is divided among several personnel independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In SR, the pursuit of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise duty management is divided between excise duty separation and the branch of the customs office, where the same tax administrators often deal with the said agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In SR, the number of tax entities is about a third of the number of employees in the field of excise duty management compared to the state in the Czech Republic; the impact of higher employees on the efficiency of excise duty management is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble of Decision No of the European Parliament and of the Council Article 1152/2003 (1152/2003) EC of 16. June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, aimed at establishing an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information to be acquired on transport and to carry out the prescribed checks, simplify intra-Community movement of goods under suspension arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="894">During the implementation of the system, Member States should allow operators, especially SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements with the lowest possible costs.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of the said EP and Council Decision admits to include national specifications, national database forming part of the system and technical or software that the Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by the system of registration of selected products (EVVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">The EMCS is fully functional in the Czech Republic from 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionality (see Annex No. 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">The so-called was introduced in the Czech Republic. Customs module and declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="901">Customs module contains a number of national functions.</seg>
<seg id="902">Transports under the EMCS system are monitored beyond the Community system in the EMCS system, started and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system ensures, after approval of a notice of receipt of a consignment intended for a beneficiary for one-time acceptance of the automatic transmission of information to the tax agency registry with subsequent invalidation of the permit.</seg>
<seg id="904">The administration of accepted and sent applications for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO is fully ensured through the system, including sending replies with an attachment in any format and providing translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">A report on manual termination of ECS exports is also allowed (only the transfer of an auto-created message is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS system does not allow e-AD approval or acceptance notice without the competent customs authority's reaction to a risk profile (risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The Declarant module is available for tax entities for free, it has the form of a web application, where the user logs into using the username and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with the CS Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each act against the EMCS customs module shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declarant Module enables tax entities to direct registration of data on initiated and terminated transport under the tax exemption regime, so tax entities do not have to spend funds on the acquisition of the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionality of the declarant module allows you to load and store data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), fill in recipient data based on SEED ID check and require compulsory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for every consignment consigned from the Czech Republic to block the security of excise duty in the corresponding amount of taxable transactions until the end of transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of security is calculated automatically by EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient amount of collateral it is not possible to send e-AD design for approval to CÚ shipment from the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and contains ARC transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax operator can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="918">The EMCS development was implemented on the basis of eight execution contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46 791 (i.e. 1 412,56 761.) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices from 2006 to the end of 2015 for a total amount of CZK 43 577 (i.e. 1 401,10 640.) without VAT.</seg>
<seg id="920">During the controlled period, the EMCS upgrade was incurred with výdaje 14 incl. VAT (i.e. 547 438,99).</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade during the controlled period and converted into one EMCS transport is on average 16,49 CZK (i.e. 0,62 €), without national transport, these costs in conversion into one transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States are CZK 24,40 (i.e. 0,92 €).</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS technical support was implemented under four contracts with execution from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015 the total amount of technical support of CZK 7 499 (i.e. 281 389,77) including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport inserted into the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6,18 (i.e. 0,23 €).</seg>
<seg id="925">Development and technical support invoices covered national solutions and developed the EVV application, which DGC had already operated before EMCS itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were paid under programming funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of service supply and other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in SR</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS system is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under suspension regime.</seg>
<seg id="930">Replaced the accompanying administrative document - the SAD used before the effectiveness of this system, thus ensuring better control and traffic control.</seg>
<seg id="931">The SR has been introduced since 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements resulting from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, called.</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which you can monitor this transport online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS system ensures the receiving and dispatch of excise goods by tax entities entitled to use the EMCS system, thus reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when EMCS was fully introduced into operation (see Annex No. 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of EMCS was implemented as another module of application equipment SysNeD and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine the amount of costs of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of EMCS was to replace a system based on administration of transport in a documentary form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefit of EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU from the notification of transport to its termination - reducing administrative costs for tax administrators and tax operators for processing, transfer and document archiving is important.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and SR, national functionality has been introduced into EMCS system, allowing traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two places in the Czech Republic or. in SR.</seg>
<seg id="944">In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and ensuring a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="945">A national functionality is also introduced to monitor the risk of the tax entity or. Transportation, with subsequent compulsory response by the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="946">The SR and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of transport within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, the costs incurred in SR to upgrade this system were byly 744 higher between 2012 and 2015 than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="948">NKÚ SR received data from the FR SR on upgrade of EMCS system only for the period from 2011, although this system has been established and operated before.</seg>
<seg id="949">Yet the costs incurred on upgrading EMCS system in SR were byly 188 higher than the costs of introducing and upgrading the EMCS system in about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">For a controlled period, the volume of expenditure related to the EMCS upgrade in SR in conversion to one transport exceeds costs of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the Czech Republic and the NKU SR met the goals.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both control institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="955">Despite the common basic legal framework, it has been found that there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of the management of excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel checks, examples of good practice were found, which could contribute to reducing tax fraud, their importance with rising tax rates will increase.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures have also been identified to reduce the cost of excise duty management.</seg>
<seg id="958">Cross-cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect tax management efficiency and limit international comparison unless mutually coordinated deep checks are carried out with tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this the role of the highest control institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lim Declaration of 1977 emphasizes that the Supreme Supervisory Institutions (SAI) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration calls for tax revenue to be controlled to the extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organization of the Highest Supervisory Institutions (EUROSAI) considers it one of the most important components of public tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">VI. EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of SAI public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="7">An important step towards optimizing SAI control activity is the development of a special strategy for public revenue auditing.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies especially to taxes as the most complex source of public income, which is most prone to great losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the economies of individual states are increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may, to some extent, be unable to carry out a control activity without cooperating with the SAI of another state.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is an audit of internationally organized fraud, which causes significant losses in the revenue of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAIs that carry out the inspection in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation between themselves.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just on VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn was created by the idea of checking the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as ′′ VAT ′′) and VIES system in the cooperation of the Supreme Supervisory Authority and the Federal Court of Auditors, Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Careful preparation followed, when both parties first had to acquaint themselves with the legal environment and procedures for VAT management in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics included in the control programme was made.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving effective and efficient VAT management is a long-term problem and individual states (especially Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax available.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our control can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the international information exchange system.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel checks on value added tax management performed in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2-2005-1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Value added tax administration after the Czech accession to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Verification of administrative cooperation in value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No Commission Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the control action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter the EU) associated with the free movement of goods and services and to check the use of the VIES system, especially when checking the application of the value added tax exemption for intracommunitary delivery.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the inspection was to examine the system of control of intracommunitary value added tax with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the abovementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">The system of exchange of value added tax information The Surveillance Authority, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter ′′ BRH ′′) in mutual cooperation under a contract concluded between the two inspection institutions on 8. June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the verification of selected commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Germany ′′), the use of information obtained by means of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">Joint final report on the results of the inspection actions has been processed within the meaning of the European Directive No. 31 to implement INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The period controlled was from 1. August 2004 to 31. August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">Parallel VAT management inspection in Czech Republic and Germany was performed under agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Outside the main point - exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No Commission Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 1925/2004-the inspection covered other topics, such as payer registration, VAT tax returns and summary reports closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, part of the inspection included the legal situation in the international bus transport of passengers and comparing some statistics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The comparison of the VAT management systems of both countries identified differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany business owners are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first criterion (among others) is for registration exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is assigned to payers, which they also use in intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, VAT payers are assigned a tax number, used only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunitary transactions, he must request an assignment of a special identification number called. VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">Since different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be offset throughout the EU (see. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus transport of persons.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of persons is exempted from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, part of the shipment taking place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">At EU level efforts should be made to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of VAT (see. 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic, payers filed tax returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany, payers are entitled to submit so-called. preliminary tax returns for VAT (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike the Czech Republic of payers, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic electronically would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While the payers report summary reports to the financial authorities in the Czech Republic, the payers report summary reports to the CLO in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="53">Therefore, data from summary reports are available immediately after submission of the financial authorities in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="54">German financial authorities have information from summary reports only after processing it into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">Fighting VAT fraud requires updated intra-communitarian transaction information to be available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Monthly summary reporting would shorten the time shift between the date of transaction and VIES data update.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would subsequently allow early examination of taxation in the Member State of the customer (see. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">Which would, however, require all Member States to accept the same deadline for submitting a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of VAT information.</seg>
<seg id="60">Czech CLO monitors the three-month deadline for information received.</seg>
<seg id="61">German CLO does not follow the past time.</seg>
<seg id="62">Consequently, the German tax administration dealt with significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the specified deadline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Due to these problems, BRH recommended the German CLO to carry out permanent warnings (see. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States develop their own risk management system (hereinafter referred to as ′′ RMS ′′) that has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">NKÚ and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, components and approaches of RMS must be exchanged and introduced in each EU Member State, otherwise the scammers will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, both SAIs tested selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thirty-one cases of commercial transactions were examined together with the application of the CLO legislation, where there were doubts about their effectiveness or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation and measured VAT tax liability for the payers.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, payers either unduly claimed the right to exemption from VAT or did not admit the acquisition of goods in VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases the financial authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases the information could not be used due to various legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to the request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases were found where payers misplaced commercial transactions in summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, VIES data were incorrect and tax administration had to check these cases (see. 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">The course of the inspection action</seg>
<seg id="79">The course of the inspection event in the Czech Republic</seg>

<seg id="94">Cooperation of both control institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">Several meetings of representatives of both supervisory institutions took place during the preparation of parallel control events before they started.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants of these meetings met the tax administration organization, legislation on VAT issues and VAT management system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">The topics of the testing phase were agreed at the meeting held in May 2006</seg>
<seg id="98">The test phase results were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>

<seg id="111">The report on the results of parallel VAT management checks between the Czech Republic and Germany was drawn up at a work meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Value Added Tax Administration in Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in Czech Republic</seg>

<seg id="119">The application for registration is required within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the taxable person to register the so-called taxable person. retrospectively where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic, who makes taxable transactions or transactions exempted from VAT with a right to deduct, can become a tax payer, even if he does not exceed the turnover of 1 000 CZK (33 EUR 575) if they meet any of the other conditions laid down in Law No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>

<seg id="125">Tax administrator data communicated by the tax agency i.e. filed application for registration with all attachments, will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he has doubts about the data, he will invite the tax agency to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">After verifying that the tax agency fulfils the conditions for registration, the tax agency issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the tax body is registered and has been given a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as 'the tax ID').</seg>
<seg id="128">The certificate shall indicate the tax administrator's date of effectiveness of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the tax period.</seg>

<seg id="132">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the VAT in the registration certificate is always of a constitutional character and the tax body is obliged to state in all cases communications (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law (e.g. law no. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The ID number contains the code ′′ CZ ′′ and the tribal part consisting of the general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier is the birth number for a natural person or. another general identifier, if such a special law, and for a legal person an identification number (clause § 33 (33). Article 12 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax body has failed to fulfil its registration obligation or at the call of the tax manager, the local tax manager shall register it without delay.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issue of the Ex officio Registration Certificate, which is served on the tax body.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, the tax agency that has been entitled to business activities is allocated a tax ID at the moment of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The tax entity uses the same tax ID even if registered as VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., which has been effective from 1. 1. 2005, the tax administrator may, in case of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, pay a taxable person up to 10 % of the total income or income for taxable transactions carried out illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he was supposed to be a registered payer by law until the date on which the tax manager decided to become a registered payer (Article 98 (98) of the basic Regulation). Article 1 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">The payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax deduction (§ 98 paragraph 98). Article 3 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it's not about sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="142">Revocation of VAT payer registration when legally established conditions are met is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Revocation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover that does not exceed the registration limit (§ 106 paragraph 106). Article 1 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer is entitled to apply for cancellation of registration at the earliest after 1 year after the expiry date of effectiveness given on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Revocation of the ′′ official power ′′ registration (§ 106 (106) Article 7 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), if: (a) the payer has not made the tax administrator without notification for 12 consecutive months of fulfilment, (b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under Law No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Payers who have no registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic Tax registered in another Member State who has no registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who takes place with the place of delivery in the country and is a person liable to admit and pay tax on such transactions under Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. (so-called. ′′ non-established payer ′′), becomes payer on the day of this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to apply for registration to the IRS for Prague 1 no later than the date of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the registration application, it is required to state all the VAT paid to it in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If the ′′ unused ′′ payer submits an application for registration later than on the date of the first taxable operation in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively because according to law No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax body became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">During retroactive registration, the Finance Office for Prague 1 requires tax entities proof that the performance has been performed (invoices or. explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a ′′ non-established ′′ tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable operation takes place, the Finance Office for Prague 1 asks for the presentation of contracts that the execution takes place.</seg>
<seg id="153">473 ′′ non-established ′′ payers were registered at the Czech Republic for Prague 1, of which 124 payers from Germany and registered as of 31. 12. 2005 951 ′′ non-established ′′ payers, of which 233 payers from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">According to the provisions of Section 106 (106) Article 9 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of the ′′ non-established ′′ payer on 31. January of the following calendar year, unless the payer has been incurred during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The NKÚ check found that if the ′′ non-established ′′ payer filed a tax return abroad for postal transport on January 25., i.e. in accordance with the law in the deadline for filing tax returns, the tax office does not often have it available on January 31.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts are relevant for the possibility of cancelling registration to the tax office later than on 31. January, it is no longer possible to cancel the ′′ non-established ′′ payer's VAT registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as ′′ AO ′′), anyone who is engaged in business is obliged to inform the municipal / municipal office or the relevant financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submission of information is one month after the business starts.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the municipal / municipal office for the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the IRS detects an undertaking that started the operation but did not register, the competent tax authority may register this payer with official power - even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-residents in Germany are legally obliged to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they execute.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">For business owners permanently residing abroad there are special financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those who are located in the Czech Republic, Chemnitz-Süd is the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="167">On April 30., 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; on March 1., 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">BRH found that these special financial authorities often refused registration called. semi-dependent independent workers based in the new Eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since employee s' work permits from ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers tried to avoid these restrictions by starting their business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These companies do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way they perform their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the competent financial authority, where he must provide information about the company and the activities he / she performs.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all financial authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the financial authorities or by universal services responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">Through this form, a risk assessment of individual taxpayers is performed before the tax office gives out the tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the competent financial authority, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the financial office, another five (or four) are to distinguish payers, with the last one always the check numbers.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur intends to participate in an intracommunitary trade, he needs a VAT identification number to receive tax exempt intracommunitary delivery.</seg>
<seg id="178">CLO allocates VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="179">CLO allocates VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when the payer automatically gives intra-communitarian delivery in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">VAT ID structure is a country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Entrepreneur registration can be cancelled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business), after all administrative work (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration realizes that he is no longer developing business activity.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In these cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can expire the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG) tax residents in Germany are not liable to pay VAT in case of 1. that turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. the following year is likely to not exceed EUR 50 000</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small business owners (′′ Kleinunternehmer ′′) are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs VAT and are not entitled to deduct entry tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small business owners must be registered at the IRS and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small businessman can claim that there will be no provision § 19 (19) of the basic Regulation. 1 UStG apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This confession is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct tax on entry.</seg>
<seg id="190">For tax non-residents there is an option to appoint tax representatives (§ 22 and UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is an essential prerequisite that they carry out exclusively tax exempt commercial operations and not be entitled to deduct the entry tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax liability of a foreign businessman, who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must include information about representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany business owners are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first criterion (among others) is for registration exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax body in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit, it has the option to apply voluntarily for VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="198">Registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but different organizational models in the federal states may cause different.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a tax ID at the moment of his first registration.</seg>
<seg id="200">In case the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same ID for intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the payer is given a tax number for registration for VAT, only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunitary transactions, he must request an assignment of a special identification number called. VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As NKÚ and BRH have identified, the German two-stage registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as in the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform municipalities or the competent financial authority about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows correct VAT measurement for previous taxation period, especially accurate estimation of VAT tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be offset throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the ID).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will allocate the VAT at birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This VAT will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the competent tax authority will ask for an economic ID, which will be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">There should be no delay in the future between national payer registration and VAT ID allocation.</seg>
<seg id="212">The work on the introduction of an IT device to manage the VAT has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus transport of persons</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the transport of persons between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempted from VAT with the right to deduct the tax.</seg>
<seg id="216">This transport is exempted from VAT, even if it is performed by tax-registered entrepreneurs in other Member States or by a taxable foreign person.</seg>
<seg id="217">Return transport is considered to be separate transportation.</seg>
<seg id="218">If ′′ non-established ′′ tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activity besides international bus transport of persons, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International transport of persons in the Czech Republic was exempted from VAT based on the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V kap. Article 5 (5) of the Treaty 1 (1) (b) where it is stated:</seg>
<seg id="220">' For the purposes of Article Article 28 (28) of the Treaty 3 (3) (b) Directive 77/388 / EEC may the Czech Republic continue to exempt the value added tax on international passenger transport under point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 17 (17) is met. Article 28 (28) of the Treaty Article 4 (4) of the directive or while the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier."</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of the legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006, implemented by § 3 b (3). 1 German VAT Act is the place of delivery of passengers (i.e. transport services) route (i.e. place) where the transport takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the route that takes place in Germany represents a taxable provision of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a tax non-resident transports passengers through Germany, the part of the route that takes place in Germany is also a taxable provision of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">A tax non-resident must notify his intention to provide passenger transport to the competent financial authority before he performs his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The IRS will register this non-resident tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notice.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to admit his taxable transportation provided in German tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 1., 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Finance Authority registered 741 Czech payers, who engaged in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">If passenger transport is provided to a tax resident who is a VAT taxable person, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax office itself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the tax resident who is the body who is liable to pay VAT to the tax authority and the net bill to the tax nonresident is the tax resident who is the recipient of the services; this process is known as the ′′ reverse charge ′′ and is in accordance with Article 196 Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the tax non-resident notification and his tax return on VAT, the German tax administration has several means to assess the correctness of the taxable provision of passenger transportation.</seg>
<seg id="234">Customs office mobile inspection groups audit buses licensed (licensed) licenses for foreign transport used to transport passengers via Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, mobile control groups shall send a control message to the competent financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to demand VAT payment from the bus driver before continuing further transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident tax deduction of the VAT paid thus calculated in his VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the IRS has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce the intention to carry out an audit that must be held in the office of the IRS or may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT measured in accordance with its legal rate, the tax authority may apply for administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If a review of VAT tax return or the discharge of tax non-resident tax duties is to be carried out, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too demanding in terms of workforce compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the tax non-resident accounts raises disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">Tax administration must audit foreign accounting, which does not only mean the need for foreign language knowledge, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transports taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the tax non-resident may not only accept the right to carry out the checks due to his national tax administration, but also the right to audit by other Member States in which he transports passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">In addition, in every Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax liabilities applicable to him in these Member States, in all languages and on all tax forms of these Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transportation therefore incurs disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic there is transport of persons between individual EU Member States or. between Member States and third countries, under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic exempted from VAT with the right to deduct tax.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport taking place on German territory is taxable.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport is provided by a non-established payer in Germany for the first time, it is required to inform the competent financial authority of the delivery of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office of this payer registers and the payer is obliged to admit taxable supply of part of the transport in the tax return in the Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Implementing the law is very time consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Finance Office are in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to a given effort, the tax return, when implemented, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time consuming duties without a financially sensitive outcome.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid excessive costs to measure VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in one Member State only.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport starts or where the provider is located.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require modification of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT tax returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of tax returns for VAT in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to submit a VAT tax return on the form prescribed by MF within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if the law does not provide otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">Own tax liability is due within the deadline for filing VAT tax return, except for the tax charged with the importation of goods under Section 20 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., for which the maturity of the tax is laid down by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a refundable overpayment is caused due to the measurement of excessive deduction, the payer will return without request within 30 days of the measurement of excessive deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied when the tax manager initiates tax proceedings regarding the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of Section 73 (73). Article 11 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the right to deduct the tax deduction may be applied in the proper VAT tax return no later than the last tax period of the calendar year in which the tax deduction could be applied.</seg>
<seg id="267">Upon expiry of this period, the right to deduct the tax deduction may be further applied within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct the tax may have been applied first.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible by submitting additional tax return to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="269">Amendment to law no. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1. 1. 2005 allows additional tax return to VAT only for the period when the right to deduct the tax deduction could be applied for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit additional VAT tax return if (a) the aggregate of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) makes a repair where the last known tax liability does not change, but only data by the tax entity previously tempered, (c) makes the rate corrected and the amount of the tax according to Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit additional tax return to VAT if it reduces the tax liability by a summary of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="272">Additional VAT tax return to the payer is required to submit by the end of the month following the finding of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">Submission of tax return to VAT in electronic form can be carried out via the Internet network or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submission after the Internet can be performed as a data report with a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message without a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In case of filing with a data report not guaranteed electronic signature, submission in writing is still required, i.e. delivery of the computer assembly to the tax administrator (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">VAT tax return contains separate rows regarding intracommunitary supply / acquisition values.</seg>
<seg id="277">Values of the acquisition of services are reported on special rows of VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated inspection within ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="279">Values of supply of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with the information given in the summary reports submitted by Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of acquisition of goods from other Member States from tax persons in other Member States shall be compared with the values obtained through VIES system from the summary report of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">The IRS is undergoing a test of credibility of VAT tax returns under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is performed automatically, because without the test, tax returns to VAT cannot be measured.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test involves calculating the credibility criteria and evaluating risk types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of Section 37 (37) Article 1 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll. the tax authority may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 (67 150) on a non-cash basis on a given period of time, or by a decision under this law. EUR).</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system used by FÚ to support tax management.</seg>
<seg id="286">The NKÚ check found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the opportunity to impose a fine on payers for not filing their VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of tax returns for VAT in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany we distinguish between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and annual VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small business owners who are not liable to pay VAT annual tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="291">In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10. th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (§ 18 paragraph 18). 2 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if VAT tax liability exceeds EUR 136 in the previous calendar year 6 or in the case of a newly established business, the relevant businessman is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10. th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to submit a monthly VAT return if last year a tax refund exceeded EUR 6 136 (§ 18 paragraph 18). 2 and UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT admission may not be made unless the amount of the annual VAT exceeds EUR 512</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT tax liability must be paid by the 10. th day of the month following the tax year in which VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tax refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by FÚ</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no time limits (according to the law) for processing tax returns and refund of excess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">For the purpose of early tax refund it is possible to offer collateral of the amount to be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process tax returns to VAT and return tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">German VAT law provides for an extension of this period (Section 18 (18) of the basic Regulation. 6 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such extension must be applied separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT tax liability a month later, provided that a special advance is paid for monthly returns.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset compared to December's VAT tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is found, the entrepreneur must submit a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT admission.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT tax return, which must be filed by May 31. of the following calendar year, is registered with the IRS, the business owner cannot fix the wrong preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Repair of the annual VAT tax return for the benefit or failure of the payer is possible within the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT tax return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT tax return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Payers are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns to VAT electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The financial authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid disproportionate hardness.</seg>
<seg id="311">Submission of annual VAT refund is possible in paper or via the Internet, either with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If done without certification, the payer must submit a confession once again on a paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">In case the payer does not file VAT returns, the tax administration is entitled to make a gross estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In case of late submission, the payer may be penalised (maximum of 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">BH found during previous inspection that the financial authorities often do not measure this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the financial authorities imposed a fine, the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="317">Therefore, the standard fine does not fulfil its aim to shorten the average delay, especially when filing annual VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="318">VAT tax return contains separate lines related to intracommunitary supply / acquisition values.</seg>
<seg id="319">Values of the acquisition of services are reported on special rows of VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on separate tax return / VAT line.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT return submitted in paper form, copy must be made either via a scanner or employees specifically designated for it.</seg>
<seg id="322">Electronically VAT return data shall be immediately available to the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all data are entered into the system, RMS staff will pass it and select cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The selected VAT returns must be rechecked by the financial authority on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration must grossly estimate the amount of VAT paid by the taxpayer, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, payers submit their tax return to VAT within 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">The taxation period depends on the amount of the payer's turnover, either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, payers submit preliminary tax returns to VAT, depending on the previous year's tax liability, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31. May of the following year, payers are required to submit an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit annual VAT tax returns has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- if the payer corrects the admitted intracommunitary transactions, the repair cannot be related to the period for which the summary report is submitted;</seg>
<seg id="335">- Federal states do not usually compare VIES data on intracommunitary acquisitions of German payers before processing annual VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with registration (see. 4.1.3) German payers are obliged to submit annual VAT tax return regardless of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation enables the German financial authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small business owners.</seg>
<seg id="338">Moreover, the responsible financial authority is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and with closing accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only on income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany have an obligation to submit VAT tax returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns in the Czech Republic electronically would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The summary report (hereinafter referred to as ′′ SH ′′) is submitted according to Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. a payer who has delivered goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the goods supplied are always reported in Czech currency broken down by tax entities, indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services provided are not included in SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH shall serve payers with monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days after its end to the local competent financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="348">Fixing the wrong data is done in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of error finding.</seg>
<seg id="349">The erroneous data given in SH are always replaced by the data given in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">Just like tax returns, payers and SH can submit in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In case the payer does not submit SH or subsequent SH and had them under law no. 235/2004 Coll. submit, the tax administrator will invite him to submit him and at the same time instruct him about the consequences in case of failure to submit SH or subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax manager is under Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll. entitled to repeatedly impose a fine up to CZK 2 000 (EUR 67 150) for failure to fulfil obligations of a non-cash nature.</seg>
<seg id="352">The NKÚ check found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the opportunity to impose a fine on the payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">Especially in the case of SH filing, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to perform their duties, because SH failure to submit does not affect VAT tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 (102) 5 law no. 235/2004 Coll. data in SH, or subsequent SH, check, delete any inconclusiveness and use data for taxation.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of non-compliance with SH data and data in the relevant (payer with monthly taxation period) or the relevant (payer with quarterly taxation period) VAT tax return, the tax manager should verify the correctness of the tax liability given in the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The wrong data in SH will be removed by filing a subsequent SH himself or may be called upon to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct the data on the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the payer will not demonstrate the data given in SH (or subsequent SH), correcting them by submitting subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">- the tax administrator has demonstrated that the data given by the payer in SH or subsequent SH are not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator does not replace the filing of the tax body by the payer by entering a repair without submission of the subsequent SH payer, only adjusts the data in the VIES database so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from SH shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">Only a national financial authority can send and receive them, designed to cooperate with other Member States in the VAT area; this is CLO (in the Czech Republic, the International Cooperation Department of VAT Management (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">O _ MCTL is an automatic message received by CLO from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Includes all erroneous VAT IDs listed in SH rows sent.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the wrong VAT ID is used in one of the common SH or subsequent SH rows, the record is made into the wrong VAT ID table.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains so-called. ′′ Notice of doubt to VAT ID ".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator will check and record the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When goods are acquired from another Member State, the payer is obliged to award VAT and indicate the values of acquisition on separate lines of VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of goods purchased declared by the Czech payer in his VAT tax return and in the value of the goods supplied, as reported by payers from other Member States in their SH, are sent from the CLO to the IRS for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax administrators have a duty to investigate the irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">(a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the respective lines of VAT tax returns is lower than the value of delivery declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case the tax administrator will check the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can either happen by changing EU data (foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the tax return to VAT (the Czech tax entity himself lodges additional tax return to VAT).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is up to the tax manager's discretion whether despite this fact he will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech tax payer has shown in the relevant VAT lines, is higher than the value of the goods supplied declared by the EU payer.</seg>
<seg id="378">Even here it is at the discretion of the administrator whether it will verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After checking the difference and clarifying the causes of its creation, the tax administrator will introduce the result of the verification into ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the verification are transmitted back to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of cases sent from CLO to the financial authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005 shows graph no. 1 (Note: source: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">The above graph no. 1 demonstrates that the number of cases transmitted from CLO to the financial authorities in each quarter of 2005 decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant decrease in number occurred in the 4. th quarter of 2005. CLO increased the minimum financial limit, including. with regard to the possibility of sending information requests to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between VAT tax returns and EU data may not always be caused by a fault on the side of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It can also be a mistake on the EU payer side or a mistake arising from the fact that in individual EU Member States some types of transactions can be introduced into SH in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of the reported transactions found at the inspected financial authorities are given table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who carry out intracommunitary delivery from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in trilateral transactions shall be required to serve SH once every quarter of a year, which indicate intracommunitary delivery according to beneficiaries (§ 18 a (odst 18 a). 1 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">SH must be submitted by the 10. th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If extension of this deadline is allowed in case of preliminary VAT returns, this applies to SH as well.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be delivered to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">From 1. January 2007 they must be administered electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exceptions may be allowed by the competent financial authorities to certain taxpayers to avoid excessive hardness.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realize that SH has false data, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In case taxpayers do not submit SH, CLO will initiate proceedings in order to make this report possible.</seg>
<seg id="396">Part of this procedure is: - the first reminder - the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine / penalty payment and - penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German tax code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO measures fines in three steps, amounts 125, 250 and 500 EUR.</seg>
<seg id="398">Besides, § 26 a (26) 1 no. UStG 5 stipulates payers act illegally unless they deliberately or negligently administrate SH, serve them incomplete, do not submit them on time or if they do not repair or repair the late SH.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offense can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000</seg>
<seg id="400">Intracommunitary supply data cannot be entered by the VIES by the IRS because SH processing is the sole task of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data are stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">Data from SH are therefore visually available only after processing to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">Deadlines for SH processing are set in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">SH data must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of incorrect VAT ID in SH German payers, CLO receives O _ MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO contacts a particular businessman and asks for correct information.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case shall be transmitted to the competent financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these financial authorities to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the inspection, BRH found that most VAT ID entrepreneurs have repaired at CLO request.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, threat and measuring three additional fines works in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud, too much time.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the competent financial authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The IRS rejected the exemption of reported intracommunitary delivery in 73 % of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the IRS asked him to submit a repaired SH to CLO, since the tax authorities cannot repair data in VIES themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the financial authorities nor the CLO checked the filing of the repaired SH, so the payers often failed to comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">Due to the fact that the CLO has no access to VAT return data, a comparison of the delivery data of goods admitted in the VAT return and SH will not take place before submitting this data to the CLO of other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">Only the financial authorities can carry out this inspection and is usually applied in the preparation of the VAT check.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States are processed into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Wrong VAT ID are selected and then submitted to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">This data is used for the purpose of inspection of acquisition by the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, CLO will recheck them based on comparison with previous calendar quarter data.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), inspection information is created and sent to the competent financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied permanently, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the assessment procedure will subsequently check these data with intracommunitary acquisitions data.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who delivered goods to another Member State serve a taxable person in another Member State within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the local tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities process SH and transmit the data to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">Values of supply of goods to another Member State, listed by the payer in SH, are compared at the financial authorities with the value of the supply of goods to another Member State, given by these payers in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the measurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who made intracommunitary delivery are obliged to serve SH quarterly until day 10. of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers serve on CLO, from 1. 1. 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">Tax authorities have SH information available only after it is processed into CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Payers from Czech Republic and Germany mention only the delivery of goods in SH, the provision of services is not listed in SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike Czech financial authorities, German financial authorities are unable to correct the wrong lines submitted by SH.</seg>
<seg id="435">Due to this limited access to German VIES data, the wrong VAT ID was not corrected, although the payer provided the correct VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="436">German tax administration does not compare data on intracommunitary supplies, which are given in the tax return to the German payer and its SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">The differences between the data of these two statements are not usually identified before the German CLO provides VIES data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Given the findings of BRH, it is clear that comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">The data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their tax returns for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison is performed by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most important cases of irregularities are handed over to the financial authorities as a reminder of possible errors in payer s' tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracommunitary acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general inspection is only processed for payers who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="444">Moreover, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intracommunitary acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control alert or if the payer is intended for inspection anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the financial authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, VAT fraud detection depends on the quality of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Carousel scams fighting requires continuously updated information on intracommunitary acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specially VIES, provides financial authorities with information that could be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be shortened by up to four months if the payers serve SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, because most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to submit VAT returns monthly - and SH does not require any further information compared to tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to prevent bureaucratic costs, the submission of SH may be associated with filing a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to serve SH monthly would cause more time disagreements between intracommunitary delivery and intracommunitary acquisition and could increase data flow between individual CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">The German Federal Government in 2006 considered general provision of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed due to federal state s' doubts.</seg>
<seg id="455">These were worried that monthly submission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the duty of monthly SH and monthly data transmission were to be effective, monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SH.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">As part of foreign trade, Germany represents the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volume of intracommunitary transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT ID or VAT IDs, contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the controlled period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data shows substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">Different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL reports may cause these differences.</seg>
<seg id="464">While Czech CLO covers their numbers for the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO covers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International level 3 information exchange</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">International exchange of information allows tax administrators to acquire information from other Member States regarding intracommunitary business transactions and payers who made these transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No On administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1798/2003 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">International exchange of information on request is made in the form of the so-called. requests for information (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ŽOI ′′), using standardized SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI or. replies to the ŽOI delivered via the CLO Financial Directorates, ensuring the translation of information contained in standardised SCAC forms into foreign language and sending it to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also ensures the income of ŽOI from other Member States and replies to the ŽOI sent, translation into Czech and distribution to local tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="472">In Article 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 8 1798/2003 the maximum deadline for the operation of the ŽOI is set for 3 months after the application is accepted.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ checks were subjected to all ŽOI transmitted during the controlled period between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total of 94 ŽOI, accepted in the Czech Republic from Germany, there were 70 cases (i.e. 74,5 %) finished within a specified three-month deadline, 23 more cases (i.e. 24,5 %) was finished after this deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany until the NKÚ check.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information about the deadlines in which replies to the ŽOI received from the Czech Republic were sent from the Czech Republic, contains graph no. 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, there were 136 cases (i.e. 40,6 %) response received within the specified three months deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53,4 %) the request was answered after this period and 19 cases (i.e. 5,7 %) no response from Germany was delivered until the NKÚ check (in the remaining 1 cases it was not possible to determine when the reply from the FRN was received).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information about the deadlines in which answers to the Czech Republic were delivered to the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic, graph no contains 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage of the values of intracommunitary transactions, given in ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany, contains graph No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As seen from the above graph, the value of business transactions, tested via ŽOI, was most frequently in the zone above EUR 60 000</seg>
<seg id="480">The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or in the form. structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous information exchange.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax administrators from other Member States are often transmitted without prior request information which may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic all information is collected at CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">'Automatic exchange' shall apply according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and at pre-specified regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to tax administrators from the form Report on delivery of a new means of transport under Section 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the tax document issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">The tax administrator shall complete the necessary data to a specially created template when processing the aforementioned form and transmit it to the contact worker at the financial director where the data are collected and within the specified deadline, i.e. notified to the CLO for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States within two months of the end of the quarter in which this information was available.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the dispatch sale, which is exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information about intra-EU operations that appear unauthorized and information about potential ′′ missing traders ".</seg>
<seg id="490">This information is sent to other Member States by means of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of international information exchange in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and spontaneous information are initiated by the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The financial authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form via e-mail directly to the German CLO transmitting SCAC forms to foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The financial authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of Germany's requests for information controlled by BRH were sent to ensure taxation of intracommunitary acquisition in another Member State or to demonstrate exemption of intracommunitary delivery from Germany to another Member State from tax.</seg>
<seg id="496">If a German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check the value of the supply of goods or services specified in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable reason for this application, the German CLO will reject any application containing an amount lower than this specified limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, German CLO translates free texts of the SCAC form [(B1- 17) or (E)], unless these texts are in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To respond to the request for information, CLO sends the application to the competent financial authority with a reference to the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no other deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although German CLO has technical conditions for monitoring the past time limits, it lacks sufficient personnel capacity to draw the attention of the financial authorities to the response of unsuccessful requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The financial authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by auditing.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit, which concerns any taxable process over a few months or so-called VAT inspection, which can relate to only one business operation that has recently been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and flexible type of audit requires no notification to the taxpayer and proved its beneficial effect in the investigation of individual taxable commercial operations.</seg>
<seg id="505">Under automatic exchange without prior request, Germany provides information to other Member States - VAT ID allocated to payers resident in other Member States - on the refund of entry tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">Moreover, Germany has committed itself to providing other Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">and. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. sending or catalog sales in other Member States not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intracommunitary acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intracommunitary delivery of goods not shown by the German payer in SH because he treated the delivery as domestic transactions, e. potential ′′ missing trader ′′ that carried out intracommunitary transactions independently of their VAT ID, f. business owners who delivered goods to potential ′′ missing traders ′′ or to those beneficiaries who abused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The sending of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated by the competent financial authorities in both Czech Republic and Germany, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech - English) and translates the sent information into English or English. German language, German financial authorities follow the instructions according to which they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a single language form.</seg>
<seg id="511">German CLO does not secure the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">By checking the ŽOI transmitted between 1. August 5. and 31. August 12. between the Czech Republic and Germany found out that the Czech tax administration has handled 74,5 % of the applications received within a specified three-month period, while ŽOI dispatched to Germany were executed by the German tax administration within the specified time limit only 40,6 % of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although German CLO alerts the financial authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not follow the past time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of missing notifications is a large number of late replies to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Due to these issues, BRH recommended regular alerts to CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, German CLO now alerts the financial authorities to answer the unfinished answers to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several departments at various tax administration organisational levels deal with risk management.</seg>
<seg id="521">The following departments address the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">Department of Methodology and Performance of VAT Risk Management Report, which, inter alia, governs the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends of these risks at both domestic and community levels.</seg>
<seg id="523">Nationwide coordinates the functioning of the role of Trustworthiness of VAT tax returns and the use of VIES data in terms of tax evasion risks in intra-communitarian transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the Czech trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risk commodities, processes conceptual risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this area with relevant EU institutions and other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">Department of International Cooperation in the Management of VAT, which, among other things, is the same. ensures exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT ID or VAT IDs, contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the controlled period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data shows substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">Different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL reports may cause these differences.</seg>
<seg id="530">While Czech CLO covers their numbers for the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO covers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">Department of Methodology Tax Control and Search, which inter alia conducts a risk analysis in the methodological management of tax checks and in accordance with risk analysis, sets priorities for the focus of tax checks in the plans of the financial directorate, processes risk analysis in the framework of tax evasion restrictions, including the collection of knowledge gained during tax management and other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Financial directors have set up search departments, which are performing, among others. searches of tax entities and areas that are at risk in terms of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax entities in terms of tax evasion risks (e.g. from internet services, work brokerage, radio and printing services etc.), analysis of chain fraud bonds and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialized inspection department is set up at selected 12 financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence, tax checks outside the territorial scope of the financial authorities under mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up a separation of specialised tax checks came from the growing findings of new and more perfect forms of tax evasion, which mainly occur with entities connected to chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on controlling fiscal entities according to the requirements of the search department, tax entities with specific activity and multinational companies and tax entities of a large scale of activity in terms of turnover size.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms were integrated into the ADIS system to reduce risks in the field of VAT: - the task of credibility of VAT tax returns, used to evaluate the risk of tax returns filed, - the role of the selection of tax entities for inspection, allowing the selections based on selected criteria of the payer for inspection, - the role of the task VIES through which tax administrators have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES enables, inter alia, to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, - to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to a Czech payer declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, - to generate a set of payers who did not submit SH, - carry out a formal check of data reported by the Czech payers in SH before sending such data to other Member States, - generate a set of payers where the data on the supply of goods to other Member States listed in VAT tax returns do not match the data in SH, - generate a set of payers where the value of acquisition of goods from other Member States listed in VAT tax returns does not match the data declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of the tax evasion risk reduction activity, tax administrators have access to registries of state authorities such as: business register, real estate cadastre, motor vehicle registry, business registry etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information is given in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the Federal (Federal) structure of Germany, the Federal Tax Administration (especially CLO) and the tax administration of 16 Federal States are involved in the development and operation of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are common working groups for developments, neither CLO nor tax administrations of federal states share a completely consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At CLO level, the ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ KUSS ′′ - the coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects the findings of the tax fraud control in a special database called the OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed for the transfer of tax fraud company names ′′ missing traders ′′ in cooperation with the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">KUSS experience is projected into RMS development in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, specialists of several other CLO and MF services are entrusted with RMS duties and powers.</seg>
<seg id="549">At CLO level, a formal inspection of the composition of VAT ID of other Member States in SH submitted by German payers is introduced.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal inspection is carried out before shipping data from SH to other Member States to improve clarity and use of VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">Verification of validity of VAT ID specified in SH is performed on the basis of O _ MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the repair of invalid VAT ID, see. also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the CLO RMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control messages based on several characteristics, which are usually called. carousel business operations to identify potential ′′ missing traders ".</seg>
<seg id="553">The Federal State s' financial authorities are instructed to process these inspection reports and report in some cases on the results of their CLO findings.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit findings confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all the available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case is likely to be expected (instead of sole focus on company turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">Therefore, BRH suggested the MF to take into account various characteristics when processing reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">RMS should also affect other facts, such as taxpayer's (morale) payment behaviour, field (economic activity) or shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the Federal States and focused on the processing of VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, RMS generates a list of those payers who showed intracommunitary delivery in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to CLO to monitor full SH administration.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares the intracommunitary acquisition reported in the payer's annual VAT tax return with VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">Tax Administration of the Federal States seeks to avoid comparing quarterly data, because this comparison would reveal too much disagreement data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">- a different period of implementation of the intracommunitary transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">- different accounts on sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing VAT tax returns data and VIES data, many Federal States have introduced RMS elements based on VAT tax returns data and some other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, employee number and payment behavior / morale of taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program their own rules for earning potential tax fraud offenders.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly tax return for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="567">Therefore, the competent tax authority receives recommendations made by RMS before the VAT determination.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this RMS is not able to project current findings into its activity, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback of the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania administration programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data of tax files in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">RMS produces once a month a list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The competent financial authorities use this list as a basis for the audit decision of proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">Following the audit, auditors must report their findings in order to be projected into RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">North Rhine-Westphalia Administrative Region uses adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a system of fuzzy based on rules.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data assessed VAT tax returns and some other facts, this neural fuzzy system or potentially useful information collection system (called. data-mining system) calculates the probability that a taxpayer committed a tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">He then compiles a monthly list of potential scam offenders.</seg>
<seg id="577">Local financial authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the taxpayers concerned for inspection and announce the findings of the data processing center.</seg>
<seg id="578">The introduction of one of these three RMS in the other spolkových is further underway.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since none of these three RMS are based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful to solve tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although this report cannot discuss specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany, NKÚ and BRH found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as different approaches in three Federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - turns out not to be a national but rather a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in multiple states.</seg>
<seg id="587">Effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and introduced in every EU Member State, otherwise the scammers will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU does not have to intervene by the Member State of the fraud initiator.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion about RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected inspection findings when verifying commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">In the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel control events, NKÚ and BRH tested the quality and use of information about selected commercial transactions, which were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">The two supervisory institutions also jointly examined the implementation of several commercial transactions, where there were doubts about their implementation, or. irregularities in the way payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their tax returns to VAT or SH.</seg>
<seg id="595">NKÚ checked a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities at the request of BRH.</seg>
<seg id="596">In 43 cases, NKÚ checked the value of intracommunitary transactions with Germany, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH due to the BRH alert.</seg>
<seg id="597">AT the request of the NKÚ, BRH checked a total of 23 cases involving commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information has been exchanged under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 via official communication with CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of selected cases was among others. a different method of registration in EU Member States found to lead to problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should have been bought in III. quarter 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500</seg>
<seg id="602">Since the Czech payer showed the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 29 869, the Czech tax manager sent a request to the Czech tax manager to the Czech Republic for a verification of the value of the goods supplied.</seg>
<seg id="603">In reply to the ŽOI delivered from Germany, the German party stated that in II. quarter of 2004, German payer supplied the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 27 381, in III. quarter worth EUR 31 997 and IV. quarter 2004 worth EUR 10 276</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply further revealed that the German payer's VAT ID was valid only from 28. August 9., but German CLO in 2006 following additional application by the German payer for validity certificate VAT ID retroactively issued a valid VAT ID certificate from 1. 5. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer did a repair of SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">The Czech payer was based on this information about the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">NKÚ found by a local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer submitted additional VAT tax returns for each tax period 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States while exercising the right to deduction VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional tax returns to VAT, the Czech tax manager could not clearly determine whether they included the value of the supply from the above German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="609">Based on NKÚ request, BRH found that a German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not apply for VAT ID on registration, he was only assigned an ID for transactions within the FRN.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is not usually possible to allocate VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case the German tax official assigned VAT ID retroactively to the above German payer in 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">German CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively unless the German entrepreneur caused the delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay caused the CLO after the payer's VAT ID application.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracommunitary delivery under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the contrary, the German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier to report intracommunitary acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these various procedures between Member States, German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Czech tax administrator asked for VAT registration of the German tax payer as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES stated the date of registration on 5. June 3., with the date 1. 2004. on the certificate of registration of the German payer issued locally by the competent German financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a response received from Germany, the German party stated that the German tax entity was registered from 1. 10. 2004, but VAT ID was provided to him in Germany for organizational reasons up to 16. 2. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">NKÚ by question at the local tax manager, found that the Czech tax manager carried out a VAT check with the Czech tax payer for the tax period III. quarter 2004 to II. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">Through this inspection, the IRS found that the Czech payer included a VAT service of CZK 9 (EUR 314) in the tax return, provided to the German payer at the time prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1. th June 10.).</seg>
<seg id="622">For tax period III. quarter of 2004, the tax authority measured VAT of 1 880 CZK (EUR 60) to the tax agency.</seg>
<seg id="623">The BRH found out, based on NKÚ's request, the German payer was allocated up to 16. 2. 2005 when he informed the IRS about his business he launched in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the IRS registered it for VAT retrospectively on October 1., 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer showed an intracommunitary acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approx. 5000 CZK).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech payer reported VAT tax return for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114 (EUR 3 642) to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">The Czech tax administrator found out when verifying the registration of the German payer in VIES system that his registration was valid from 11. 11. 2004, i.e. only after delivery of goods by Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer submitted additional DAP to VAT, showing the tax base for transactions in the country worth 114 615 CZK (EUR 3 642) and VAT of CZK 21 (692 EUR) paid for.</seg>
<seg id="629">NKÚ found by a question at the local competent tax office in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer subsequently submitted an application for a revision of the proceedings regarding the additional tax return to VAT and presented a confirmation of the German tax administration that the German payer was taxed from 1. 1. 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of registration of the German payer in international information exchange.</seg>
<seg id="631">The response received from Germany showed that VAT ID was allocated to the German payer up to 11. 11. 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for renewal.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found out that in the present case it was not an intracommunitary acquisition of goods because the German payer obtained VAT ID up to 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient reported the acquisition as an intracommunitary acquisition and declared VAT on this acquisition when demanding the input tax refund of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, because there would not be changes in the value of VAT that the German payer had to pay, the tax manager in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH further found that the name of the German payer, listed in ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, resulting in two German tax entities confusing.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer confused the Czech tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax manager verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in I. quarter 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">NKU found out by a local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that this administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer verifying that the delivery of goods was carried out and the Czech payer charged and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not confess the acquisition of goods in VAT tax return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In VIES application, the Czech tax manager found out that the German payer was registered to VAT for intracommunitary transactions only from 21. 4. 2005, i.e. only after delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax manager asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German payer so that he could take steps to pay tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Financial Authority assessed the commercial transaction as acquisition of goods from the non-payer from Germany and therefore the Czech payer on the said commercial transaction was not taxed.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that according to German legislation, a VAT ID does not have to have a VAT ID allocated to intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have VAT ID available to the customer from another Member State and be able to demonstrate the transport of the goods to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act, it was an intracommunitary transaction and VAT should be measured in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax manager noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine at the value was not the basic subject of the German supplier's business.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to ŽOI regarding intracommunitary transactions with a value of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to data from VIES in III, the Czech payer had a Czech payer. quarter of 2004 to buy goods from a German payer worth EUR 12 561</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax check on the tax agency for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">In international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax administration via the SCAC form to verify the delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of goods, claimed that he had never traded with the German company and in his accounts the acquisition of these goods was not accounted for.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the request for evidence - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, justifying that the turnover was not more than EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory reasons were given.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since the Czech tax manager did not obtain evidence for the measurement of the tax on the goods purchased, he ended the tax check without finding and the tax obligation remained in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">The BRH found that the German payer performed as the so-called based on the NKÚ request. ′′ fiscal representative ′′ (§ 22 a - e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer showed the said supply in its annual VAT tax return and SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">The claim to exemption of delivery has been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the BRH alert, the German financial authority will send documents needed to the Czech Republic for measuring the tax on acquired goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the answers to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than replies from Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">NKU found out by inspection that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5. th quarter of 2004. to check the value of the goods supplied.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer reported the delivery of goods to a Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in the same period, but the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods only of EUR 35 314 in the VAT tax return.</seg>

<seg id="666">NKÚ found out that ZOI had not been delivered from Germany until the time of inspection.</seg>
<seg id="667">The NKÚ further found out by a question from the local tax manager that the Czech payer did not include the delivery of new means of transport for the German payer in VAT tax return for the said German payer worth 11 816 CZK (EUR 375 472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax agency filed the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">According to NKÚ request, the BRH found that for technical reasons the German CLO did not transmit the aforementioned ZOI to the local competent financial authority for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the BRH alert, a German customer was inspected in Germany, which found that all cars were properly taxed and that the relevant cars were sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have been bought in IV. quarter 2004 from the German payer passenger car worth EUR 48 500</seg>
<seg id="672">The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="673">A question from the local tax manager in the Czech Republic found out that the Czech payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax return was not filed by the Czech payer even after the calls of the tax administrator, so on 23. 5. 2005 the tax authority measured VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2005 2. 6. the CLO highlighted the above delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent ZOI to Germany regarding the abovementioned delivery.</seg>
<seg id="677">Since the response to ŽOI was delivered to the Czech Republic on 7. August 2., it was not known until the end of the NKÚ inspection, how the Czech tax manager used information obtained by international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tax office of the Czech payer due to failure to comply with the obligations under the VAT law cancelled VAT registration on 23. August 2005</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the ŽOI because the check carried out by the tax authorities with the payers was not completed at the time of the NKÚ and BRH inspection:</seg>

<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describe the reasons for differences between the intracommunitary acquisition values, which the recipient stated in the tax return and values stated by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">Checked cases showed that the most common reasons for differences were not the time shift or the incorrect value of intracommunitary supply of goods in SH:</seg>

<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer showed corrected goods values and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the repair was made.</seg>
<seg id="702">This included the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">During the international exchange of information, the German tax manager requested via the SCAC form to verify the supply of goods and services made in III. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was supposed to supply the German payer with a total value of EUR 396 126 and provide services worth EUR 11 885</seg>

<seg id="714">BRH found that based on a response from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that in the case of the transaction it was the delivery of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer including services for assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this special case, the place is called. work is done where the production line was installed.</seg>
<seg id="716">According to German VAT law, the German recipient is liable to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the beneficiary can claim VAT deduction from the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the value of VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the repairs in VAT tax return were neglected by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. Czech payer A according to data from VIES in February 2005, he should have bought a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to ŽOI, the German party stated that the German payer C added the German payer C to the Czech payer B, which was supposed to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004</seg>
<seg id="722">According to German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational component of the German payer C in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Furthermore, the answer to the request for information revealed that German payer C sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the German payer C in Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">Since the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">NKÚ by a question from the tax manager of the local payer B found that according to VIES data, German payer C added in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027</seg>
<seg id="727">The payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the local tax manager from the Czech Republic sent ŽOI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to this request, the machine was delivered.</seg>
<seg id="729">Another investigation with payer B, the Czech tax manager found out that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the bookkeeping of payer B and that it could be a machine of the same type as the organisational component of the German payer C to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">NKÚ further found out that the Czech tax administrator local payer A conducted a local investigation with this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had an invoice of German payer C dated 7. 2. 2005, on which the payer A was listed as a machine customer.</seg>

<seg id="733">The payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">Handover of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9. 2. 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax authority to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found out that German payer C machine worth EUR 88 027 was not delivered to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">So it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods, but a taxable operation in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax manager did not acknowledge the German tax payer C tax exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D added the machine to Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German legislation, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Next, BRH found out that German payer C stated in his SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This delivery was not verified during the tax inspection carried out by the German tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following scheme shows relations between participants in the abovementioned commercial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">NKU found that the Czech tax administration accepted a request from Germany for information in which the German tax manager asked for verification of intracommunitary delivery from a German payer worth 879 680 625 EUR to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax manager, there was a suspicion that this case was a fake intracommunitary delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">In ŽOI it was further stated that German payer since 1999 did not carry out any active business activity.</seg>
<seg id="748">NKÚ found out that the Czech tax manager conducted a local investigation with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the opinion of the director of the Czech company, it was probably a claim by the German payer against the German tax administration, which was applied by the Czech payer as a partner of the German company with the German financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to information provided by NKÚ the Czech tax manager has no information about the German tax administration dealing with the issue of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not the delivery of goods, yet the value is still included in the VIES system as an intracommunitary delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not show intracommunitary acquisition of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to VIES data, German payer added in III. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the Czech payer of goods totalling EUR 33 205 The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator asked for verification of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">The German tax administration stated in reply to this request that the German payer sent part of the goods to the Czech payer, the Czech payer picked up the remaining goods personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By a question with a local tax manager in the Czech Republic, NKU found out that before receiving a response to ŽOI, the Czech payer submitted additional tax returns to VAT for those periods.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in the values of the acquisition were not resolved, so the Czech tax manager recommended to carry out a tax check with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">No inspection has been carried out yet.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. German payer delivered according to data in VIES in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854</seg>
<seg id="761">The Czech payer admitted intracommunitary acquisition only equal to EUR 14 856 for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator asked for verification in the international exchange of information the value of deliveries made.</seg>
<seg id="763">The response to ŽOI, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total value of delivery of goods EUR 31 999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech payer and VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="764">NKÚ with a question from the local tax manager in the Czech Republic found that after receiving an answer from Germany, the Czech tax manager contacted the Czech tax manager and agreed with him that after checking these invoices with the company owner, he will discuss the submission of additional tax return to VAT for III. quarter 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">Additional VAT tax return has not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech NKÚ tax administrator said that he will proceed to comply with the specified deadlines for possible additional VAT measurement for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">German payer had in IV. quarter 2004 to supply the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 11 600</seg>
<seg id="769">The German tax manager asked for confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged German payer founded more fictional companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">When checking the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of goods to the IRS.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech payer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were sold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">Czech payer presented documents of sale of goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All of these facts suggested tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in response to ŽOI.</seg>
<seg id="775">NKÚ found by question at the local tax manager in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer submitted additional tax return to VAT for IV based on investigations carried out. quarter 2004, including the value of acquisition of goods, inter alia. from a German payer while claiming the tax deduction on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT on the sale of goods in Germany did not include VAT in the Czech tax return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator measured additional tax return to VAT after a local investigation without change.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, it was not the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator thus incorrectly concluded the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax manager immediately after receiving a response to the ŽOI, which stated that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the German payer's tax return and requested VAT of EUR 1 600</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent tax authority sent a notification to the financial authority of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, the payers showed intracommunitary transactions, which probably did not actually happen:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information whether the Czech payer bought a car worth EUR 47 400 from a German payer in February 2005</seg>
<seg id="785">The attachment of the application was a copy of the Czech VAT registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="786">A copy of the passport of the person who was supposed to carry out the transport of the said car was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">By investigating the Czech tax manager found out that it was a stolen passport, the person in it did not bring any vehicle to the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax agency.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Czech tax administrator has never issued a VAT certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German party.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was given by the Czech tax administrator in the response to ŽOI together with the statement that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods - the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">NKU found out by a question at the local tax manager in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer did not live at the address listed in the commercial register and the company manager was non-contact.</seg>
<seg id="791">The Czech tax administrator, after the alleged proceedings for the tax period February 2005, measured a tax obligation of CZK 0 to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="792">Another investigation by the Czech tax manager found that the vehicle in question was sold to another Czech operator who bought it via an advertisement on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the local German tax manager based on the Czech response to ŽOI will not accept the German payer's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax authority was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3000 between the value of the goods acquired in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was said that the Czech payer should have delivered during IV. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the German payer of goods worth EUR 89 424</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax manager asked for verification of supply and their remuneration for international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax manager stated in a response to ŽOI that the only director of the Czech company was deleted from the Trade Register on 8. 7. 2005 and the new manager was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to the company of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed tax returns for VAT and SH, which, after deleting the director from the Trade Register, was signed by an unauthorized person - the company's partner.</seg>
<seg id="800">The Czech tax payer's accounting officer confirmed that the company's partner deposited cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">The cashier's documents were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">NKÚ in the Czech Republic by question at the local financial authority found out that the tax manager recognized the Czech tax payer as IV. quarter 2004 entitled to VAT exemption on delivery of goods to another Member State worth 1 326 CZK (EUR 42 145) and I. quarter 2005 of 1 CZK 416 (EUR 47 548).</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found out that the tax manager in Germany did not correct the German customer's VAT tax return, because the German judge confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since earlier inspection revealed no sign of tax fraud, tax liability will not be possible.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to data in VIES, German payer bought goods from the Czech Republic in 4 2005 251 after acquiring EUR 43 274 worth of goods in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In his tax return for 2004 and in his tax return for 2005, the German payer did not show intracommunitary acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="807">Moreover, he did not show adequate deliveries either.</seg>
<seg id="808">Due to these differences, the German IRS sent ŽOI for the 4. rd quarter of 2005 and 1. th quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier showed intracommunitary delivery of goods to the German payer totaling 167 246 CZK (EUR 5 615 299) in SH.</seg>
<seg id="810">On June 6., 2006, ŽOI was delivered, in which the German party asked to check whether the Czech payer of reported intracommunitary delivery was held.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request was not possible because the Czech payer had no manager.</seg>
<seg id="812">As it follows from materials provided by NKÚ by the competent tax manager, on 30. June 3., a protocol was written with the director of the Czech payer on the start of the VAT check for IV. quarter 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The payer was also invited by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above periods, but he did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">The Czech payer's only director disappeared according to the Trade Register of functions on 16. 5. 2006, the new director was not named.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech payer stopped filing tax returns for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="816">During the NKU inspection in cooperation with BRH, among other things, he checked several cases of intracommunitary delivery between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not subject to previous exchange of information between tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two top control institutions were transmitting information on the proven cases via the CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent financial authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Due to this information the company was registered since June 2005 but did not receive German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind power plants and for the delivery of these wind power plants on behalf of, at risk and at the expense of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to lack of capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following scheme shows the contractual relations and the method of transporting wind power plants:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of carrying out these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">- Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind power plants to assemble under his name, at his risk and his account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the installation of this delivery took place in Austria, the delivery of wind power plants is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Because the carrier was instructed by the Danish businessman (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and at his own expense, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although wind power plants were sent to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">Therefore, this delivery is rightly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted tax on entry in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">Transport of some wind power plants started in Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- Delivery of those wind power plants that are made in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- Delivery of other wind power plants manufactured in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intracommunitary delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracommunitary delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found out that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intracommunitary acquisition or submit SH to the German CLO in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intracommunitary delivery uniformly as an intracommunitary delivery from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ found that (eCR) showed no intracommunitary delivery to Austria, but intracommunitary delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">Verification of taxation of intracommunitary acquisition in Austria would require cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no sign of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the NKÚ and BRH examined transactions to highlight the differences between VIES reporting and VIES data caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">Checked cases also demonstrate that changes in legislation need time to apply new legislation into practice by payers and financial authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. V SH for II. up to IV. quarter of 2004, the Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totaling 792 977 CZK (EUR 25 197 885).</seg>
<seg id="841">For the same period another Czech payer in SH showed intracommunitary delivery to another German payer totaling CZK 18 157 (EUR 576 970).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to information provided by NKÚ from BRH, both cases were the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers stated the abovementioned delivery in SH in accordance with the text of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">By further examination of the abovementioned transactions, the group checking NKÚ found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and the Germany in the regulation of delivery and delivery. acquisition of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the payers showed electricity supply in accordance with the valid version of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intracommunitary supply of goods, in terms of German law in force in 2004, it was not an intra-communitarian acquisition, but a taxable operation with the place of operation in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in legal adjustments was removed in the Czech Republic by the adoption of law no. 635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Administrative Charges Act, effective from 1. 1. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. During the examination of selected intracommunitary transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer in the 1. th to 4. th quarter of 2005 163 Kč (EUR 8 071 823) and another Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totaling 263 470 776 CZK (8 8 846 050 EUR).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by NKÚ by BRH, both cases were the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1. 1. 2005, in case of electricity supply, the place where the customer has its registered office, place of business or where the establishment for which the goods are delivered.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have introduced electricity supply to SH in 2005</seg>
<seg id="851">The two above-mentioned payers showed intracommunitary supply of electricity in SH, the VIES data was distorted by a total of 503 881 CZK (EUR 16 917 873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">Cooperation met the goals of BRH and NKÚ.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs gained a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">Cooperation revealed differences in both systems and showed that VAT rules differ.</seg>
<seg id="856">Suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected during parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to check afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">Based on the inspection findings, both SAI made recommendations regarding VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="859">Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of a follow-up check.</seg>
<seg id="860">New experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both control institutions is the basis for successful VAT management checks.</seg>

June 2003 establishing an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products requires Member States and the European Commission to introduce an electronic system from 1. July 2009 (Excise Movement and Control System), which would allow excise tax administrators in individual Member States to acquire real-time information about the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently used only in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the tax exemption regime and ensuring more efficient control of the movement of non-taxed products within all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">National transport databases of individual Member States will be part of this system.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport started and ended in the Czech Republic in the Module of Registration of selected products (hereinafter referred to as ′′ EVVV ′′).</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have access to the system online.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of transport carried out only in the Czech Republic, tax administrators can obtain information about the start or termination of transport immediately after registration of the accompanying document by the customs office to EVVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the tax security for transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration of the termination of transport by the customs office of the local beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in SR use a database based on SysNed application software that ensures the automation of their activities in the management of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse operator, tax warehouse operator or authorized recipient to SysNed application software, this data will automatically be transferred to the ′′ System for Exchange of Data ′′ database (SEED).</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and course of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting of representatives of the NKÚ-Czech Republic and representatives of the NKÚ SR, which discussed a specific cooperation procedure in the implementation of parallel checks in the field of excise taxes, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">Both parties have acquainted with each other's excise duty rules and the organization of excise duty management in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR during the authorization or. when commencing and terminating transport of excise products under conditional exemption regime and exchange of information between excise tax administrators of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The meeting was agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties: - they will process total data on the quantity of excise duty products transported from the Czech Republic to the SR and on the contrary, whose transport started during the controlled period - they will compare data on transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - code of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 in the tax exemption regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the checks, the verified periods were extended by October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under the tax exemption regime were subjected to checks.</seg>
<seg id="106">In tables no. 1 and no. 2 The total quantity of excise products transported under the tax exemption regime between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the controlled period is stated.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of the transportation of goods under the tax exemption regime</seg>
<seg id="108">NKÚ-Czech Republic handed over the Slovak side a database of transport ended in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 5 738 items covered mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">NKÚ SR handed over to the Czech side a database of transport completed in SR, which contained a total of 3 items listed on the accompanying documents, 696 items covered mineral oil, 2 066 items of alcohol and 557 items tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">NKÚ-Czech Republic compared data on transport provided in the registration of launched transport in the Czech Republic with data on closed transport registered in SR.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are given in table no. 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">Transport data in November 2004 and September 2005 compared the NKÚ-Czech Republic with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which the NKÚ SR handed over to him at the beginning of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data allowing reliably to agree individual transports and therefore only 63 % of the started transport was allocated.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transportation has been assigned according to multiple data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.</seg>
<seg id="115">Transport data started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR in October and November 2005 compared the NKÚ-Czech Republic with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, based on which 93 % of the started transport was clearly assigned.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the Czech Customs Administration database, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in liters or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">In most cases the amount of alcohol was reported in liters, which, however, could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of the percentage of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">Quantity of tobacco products has been reported in pieces, thousands of pieces and kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">Transports started in the Czech Republic, whose termination of the Slovak database failed to verify reliably or where the information on the transported quantity of products was not in accordance with the information on the transported quantity of products, were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">The checks were subjected to accompanying documents for 487 transportation of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="121">The inspection of these documents was carried out at the customs offices where the NKÚ-Czech Republic carried out a check.</seg>
<seg id="122">For transport permitted by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested via DGC.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech Republic asked the Slovak party to verify the implementation of 141 transport, which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide confirmed copy no. 3 accompanying document or the quantity of products listed on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products specified in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">The Slovak party was also transmitted data on transport registered in the Slovak database, which did not contain the Czech customs administration's transport database.</seg>
<seg id="125">NKÚ SR traced 95 transport in the Slovak customs administration database.</seg>
<seg id="126">Verification of the remaining 46 transport was requested by local customs authorities, which showed their completion by copy of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak party forwarded the Czech side a copy of accompanying documents, based on which transport was identified in the Czech database, except for transports carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of initiated transport.</seg>
<seg id="128">A check of these cases was found:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 alcohol transport transports were registered in the Slovak Transport database totaling 276,7 liters of alcohol implemented by the Czech tax agency in 2004 and 20 transport of alcohol in total of 404,66 liters of alcohol implemented in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">NKÚ-Czech Republic found out that it was transportation of taxed products, which the consignor does not need the approval of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The consignor informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of transport. Transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under the tax exemption scheme;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 mineral oils transportation were registered in the Slovak transport database, combined nomenclature code 2710 2710 11 21, totaling 173 thousand. liters implemented by the Czech tax agency between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">NKÚ-Czech Republic found that between May 2004 and June 2005 the tax agency carried out a transport of 102 thousand. liters of tax-free mineral oils without proper approval.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax body held a special authorization for the acceptance and use of tax exempt products, on the basis of which he could supply only to the holder of the same authorization.</seg>
<seg id="135">The opening of transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic did not announce the opening of transportation and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1 680</seg>
<seg id="136">Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax body transported 71 thousand to the territory of SR. liters of taxed mineral oils. In these cases he did not fulfil his legal obligation by notifying the opening of transport to the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="137">The consignor in the Czech Republic can start transport of products entered into free tax circulation in the Czech Republic without the approval of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the start of transport.</seg>
<seg id="138">A tax body collecting products placed in free tax circulation in another Member State is required to report the quantity before collecting them and securing the tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">Products can only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, the elements of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also admits the use of the accompanying document for transport under the suspension scheme, but clearly indicates that it is a ′′ simplified accompanying document for tax inspection (excise products) ".</seg>
<seg id="141">The same legislation on transport and acceptance of products entered for free tax circulation in another Member State applies in SR.</seg>
<seg id="142">In these cases, tax entities transported products entered into free tax circulation with an accompanying document for transport under the tax exemption regime, whose 3. and 4. made by the recipient was submitted to the tax administrator in the SR for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in SR registered these transports into the transport database under the tax exemption regime because the accompanying documents did not indicate that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">NKÚ SR compared the Czech Customs Transport Database with the Slovak Customs Administration Database and found out:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases the quantity of products transported were reported in unity, e.g. mineral oil has been shown in liters, hectolitres or kilograms; alcohol was shown in liters or liters of alcohol, thus making it difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of alcohol transported in the invoices did not match the quantity registered in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- all related invoices were not listed in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- two transports of alcohol from the Czech Republic to SR were registered in the Slovak Customs Administration database, which was not located in the database of Czech customs administration, which was not located in the Czech customs administration database.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak party handed over copies of accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR</seg>
<seg id="151">Conditions of cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the management of excise duties were adapted until 30. June 2005 by Council Directive 77/799 / EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxes, certain excise duties and insurance taxes.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1. July 2005, Regulation No 2005 entered into force. 2073/2004 laying down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange information necessary for the correct excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office that secures contacts with other Member States in the field of excise duty management and is responsible for exchange of information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, the report ′′ Excise Liaison Office ′′ (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ELO Czech Republic ′′ was set up on DGC to secure exchanges of information in the field of excise duties between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">Security of tasks related to the management of systems for control of movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of mutual administrative assistance information between Member States of the European Union and the SR was carried out with effect from 1. May 2004 by ELO customs of the office of Poprad.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1. July 2005, the ELO department (based in Poprad) shall carry out the tasks of the ELO department (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ELO SR ′′).</seg>
<seg id="157">According to Article 3 (3) Article 3 of Regulation No 3 2073/2004 The central contact authority is responsible, in particular, for - exchange of data kept in the SEED electronic register, - early warning system ′′ Early Warning System Excise ′′ (EWSE) - requests for verification of movement of excise goods sent to other Member States or from ′′ Movement Verification System ′′ (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MVS ′′).</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and function of SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are adapted in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 24 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - a system for exchange of information on tax entities trading excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system consists of national excise tax payer registers and allows tax administrators in the territory of the European Union to determine whether the person is entitled to do so with excise products.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise duty purposes only.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State ensures that persons involved in movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information stored in this database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Law No. 98/2004 Z. z., s s 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Z. z., s s 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Z. z., s s 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Z. z. and s § 39 of law no. 107/2004 Z. Z. ELO SR runs an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, eligible beneficiaries and tax warehouses - SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or a beneficiary to SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, a licensed recipient or a tax warehouse is registered into the SysNed database, the related data will automatically be transmitted to SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">NKÚ SR found that the SEED database exchange between the customs administration of the SR and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the controlled period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">Customs administration of SR accepted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">Data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from the national registry, where all persons entitled to dispose of excise duty products and licenses issued for the handling of these products.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the SEED international database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Applications from customs offices for information from the SEED database of other Member States are obtained only through the ELO Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - Early Warning System aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the transport of risk consignments is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The transport of certain excise products in quantity exceeding the limits laid down by the European Commission Regulation and, on the one hand, is considered to be a risk consignment.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is made in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - sent when the limits are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- warning message - sent if the transport of goods is evaluated as risk.</seg>
<seg id="176">ELO SR uses SEED database to send a warning message using the SEED database to check the data contained in the accompanying document when evaluating the risk level.</seg>
<seg id="177">In case the SEED database does not agree with the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the recipient of the goods or the registered office of the consignee), ELO SR shall produce a warning report sent to the ELO Member State of the recipient of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">ELO is governed by CED 317 and CED 457 commissions for tax and customs areas, which define, among other things, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measure for the preparation of informative and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the controlled period of ELO SR, ELO sent one warning message to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on started transportation of products in excess of the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when transport approval is approved.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax manager in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as a risk based on his own analysis, he will process the so-called. a warning message sent to the relevant Member State via ELO Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005 ELO Czech Republic sent two warning messages to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The MVS - the system of control of the movement of goods - enables the individual transportation of excise products and the control of the specified route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document via MVS applications.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information takes place on request in which ELO specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system is used especially when the consignor takes over the confirmed copy No. 3 accompanying document and required for example refund of excise duty and where the data provided in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the controlled period of ELO SR, ELO Czech Republic sent 33 applications to MVS.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO Czech Republic sent ELO SR 25 applications from MVS.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs offices in the Czech Republic most often examined the data contained in the accompanying documents, especially the amount received or received. the products dispatched or whether the consignor of the products specified in the accompanying document is entitled to deal with excise products, unless this fact could be verified in the SEED international database.</seg>
<seg id="189">The applications received by MVS were sent to customs offices located in both countries, competent for the recipients or consignors of excise products.</seg>
<seg id="190">Customs authorities checked the required data and notified the result of the investigation through ELO to the second Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation of the NKÚ-Czech Republic and the NKÚ SR enabled the basic legislation on excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR in the opening and termination of transport of products under the tax exemption regime between the two states, registration of these transports and further comparing information exchange between customs authorities in international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Differences were found by comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and SR:</seg>
<seg id="194">(a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax managers when initiating the transport of products under the tax exemption scheme.</seg>
<seg id="195">Transport of products under the tax exemption regime can be launched by a tax body in the Czech Republic only with the approval of the tax administrator, who will authorise the start of transportation, provided that transported products were provided with a tax security in the amount of tax on them.</seg>
<seg id="196">Start of transport of products under tax exemption regime in SR shall not be subject to tax manager's permission.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the controlled period, the tax agency was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the initiation of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">The transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could have started without informing the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendment to all excise duty laws were gradually passed in the SR, according to which the consignor of goods under the suspension regime is required to send a copy of copy of copy No before transport started. 1 the accompanying document by electronic or fax to the customs office, which is locally competent to the consignor;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for the dispatch of copy No. 3 accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy no later than the following working day after the end of the transport. 3th and 4th accompanying document tax administrators for verification.</seg>
<seg id="202">Certified copy No. 3 is required to send the consignor no later than the following working day after receiving it from the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in SR is obliged to send copy No to the consignor of the products. 3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the product receiver no later than the 15. th day of the month following the month in which he accepted the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in both SR and Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under the tax exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping this evidence is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="206">Customs authorities in both countries shall register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no uniform electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under the tax exemption regime between Member States of the European Union that allows managers of excise duties in individual Member States to obtain information on the transport of goods in real time.</seg>
<seg id="208">According to Decision 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16. June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of excise products is envisaged from 1. July 2009</seg>
<seg id="209">Based on the cooperation agreement in the control activity, the Czech party handed over to the Slovak party a database of transport of products under a conditional tax exemption regime started in SR and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 items for transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak party handed over to the Czech party a database of transport of products under a tax exemption regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3 items for transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech party compared the traffic data contained in the registration of initiated transport in the Czech Republic with the transport registration closed in SR.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak party compared data on transport of goods under the tax exemption regime started in SR and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">Comparison of data was made difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not uniformly reported in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to unequivocally attribute data on individual transport in both records, the accompanying documents were checked and the violation of the tax exemption regime and the cases of tax evasion were not found.</seg>
<seg id="217">Based on the knowledge from parallel checks, it can be stated that Member States can obtain valuable information from transport records to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">Establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No of the European Parliament and of the Council 1152/2003 / EC will allow the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movement under the tax exemption regime in the European Union territory.</seg>
<seg id="219">Communicating</seg>
<seg id="220">This report was made in Czech, English and Slovak languages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value added tax management in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of the follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes are generally a key source of public income.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is therefore obvious that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">An example is value added tax fraud (hereinafter also ′′ VAT ′′).</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, EUR 100 billion is estimated in the European Union (hereinafter the ′′ EU ′′) each year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005 participants VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Within this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very appropriate area for control cooperation, since it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Czech Republic's Supreme Supervisory Authority (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, also ′′ BRH ′′) performed the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is expanded across the EU, close cooperation between SAI is required to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore both SAIs decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel check.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2-2009-0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Control subject: (CZ) Value added tax management (D) Bilateral audit with NKÚ (follow-up check)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of control:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the control action was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for solving selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Germany ′′), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the context of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The inspection action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement recommendations issued by NKÚ and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other VAT related areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting inspection findings were intended to compare with the established best practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The period controlled was the years 2006 to 2008, in case of factual context and the period preceding and following, until the end of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">The subsequent VAT management check in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected during previous parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them requested further clearance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Based on inspection findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations regarding VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="29">The subsequent inspection action performed was used to evaluate measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inspection further focused e.g. on selected cases of high-risk intracommunitary transactions, mutual assistance in recovery of claims and VAT checks on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the inspection of VAT management in selected areas in both countries, inspectors have reached the following inspection findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel checks, comparing VAT registration systems in both countries identified differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since various forms of registration cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonizing conditions for registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation was presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">Proposal for amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1798/2003 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Council Regulation (EC) No 218/92 1798/2003 ′′) requested the extension of existing databases within the EU, including VAT tax identification numbers database.</seg>
<seg id="38">He also adjusted common standards for registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="39">SAI expected EU Member States to agree on adequate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of the document agreed by EU Member States within ECOFIN does not contain the issue anymore.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret to say that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to consider this project a relevant tool for prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="44">In the context of international cooperation, it was recommended in the previous control action that all EU countries should introduce a monthly deadline for submitting summary reports and thus allow for more timely examination of the values of intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive Article 2008/117 (2008/117) EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion related to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for summary reports of intra-EU transactions to one a month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1. January 2010, implemented in Germany since July 1., 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to report summary reports monthly was not introduced within the specified deadline in accordance with the applicable EU regulations, while in the Czech Republic did.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany in order to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of interconnection of both VAT returns systems and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted BRH recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is ongoing and BRH will monitor further developments in detail.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the EU risk management system Based on the results of previous inspection action, both SAI agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system must be exchanged and introduced in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the offenders of fraudulent activity will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The inspection found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their advantages and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the NKA checked the EUROCANET system, which allows information exchange within the EU, while BRH focused on German participation in the so-called. risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Subsequent inspection of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous inspection action, commercial transactions were jointly examined, where there were doubts about their implementation or irregularity in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or summary reports to the tax payer from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAIs selected nine cases for subsequent inspection, which included intracommunitary movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">Checks carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not closed on the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">The subsequent inspection action verified that most tax proceedings in connection with the selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were closed and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT measurements or avoidance of tax refund at the entrance).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Checking selected cases of risk intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intracommunitary transactions performed by EU payers, which were included in the EUROCANET system were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">The EUROCANET system is a tool for detecting risk tax payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">Member States participation in this system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant of the system if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">Given the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information about which suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated as hazardous.</seg>
<seg id="68">The NKÚ identified both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases with suspicion of carousel shops or VAT fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrators have limited options for controlling risk transactions, especially when it comes to so-called. missing traders, with mere physical vetting of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent behavior to the tax body.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation for tax administrators occurs when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracommunitary carousel shops.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation and also monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, hesitates to actively engage in the EUROCANET system because of the absence of sufficient legal base.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risk tax payers, which have been proven to the German tax administration until now.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this field it is necessary to communicate and exchange experience among EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council has reached political agreement on the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">Experience gained so far using the EUROCANET system should be the basis for creating this new VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the field of international aid in the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international aid in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="81">NKÚ and BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs find it useful to renegotiate at EU level to find a way to avoid persistent inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, SAI agrees that reliable statistics should include more information about VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be helpful if the Commission, based on more detailed statistics, was to process analysis to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to both SAIs, this means assistance for Member States with low enforcement success rate to increase the level of recovery to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter also ′′ VDS ′′) in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from tax administrators on areas that SAI consider essential to the management of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The answers received clearly indicate that the situation in both countries develops differently.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system based on a large volume of relevant data to direct the selection of cases with a tendency to risk (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT checks in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">The establishment of a specialised VDS finance office is planned in 2012</seg>
<seg id="96">There is no similar system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT checks in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far more focused on the selection of individual cases in question, especially based on VAT tax return data and summary report.</seg>
<seg id="98">Analysis of this data relies on various components of risk management that will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. The course of the inspection action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 The course of a control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The inspection was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Unit II.-by the department of state budget revenue and territorial unions IX. Pilsen, X. České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The controlled persons were: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter the ′′ Czech Ministry of Finance ′′) and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter ′′ FÚ ′′): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ in Breclav, FÚ in Domažlicích, FÚ in Hodonin, FÚ in Hradec Králové, FÚ in Cheb, FÚ in Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ in Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ in Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava III, FÚ in Písek, FÚ in Pilsen, FÚ for Prague 1, FÚ for Prague 4, FÚ for Prague 8, 8, in Rakovník, FÚ in Sokolov, FÚ in Tábor, FÚ in Vysokém Myto, FÚ in Zlín and FÚ in Žamberku.</seg>
<seg id="103">The College of the Supreme Supervisory Authority approved the inspection conclusion of this inspection action on April 27., 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 The course of inspection action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The inspection was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the inspection unit for indirect taxes and personnel of designated regional inspection authorities in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following the selection of case samples, many spolkových were notified of the mission of the control action.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, there were control events in the following spolkových: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files of the following financial authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, there was a discussion with the financial authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-south) and the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münsteru.</seg>
<seg id="110">The report on inspection findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation of both control institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">The preparation of parallel control actions took place in September 2008 to discuss and identify control topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">After December 2008, the top leaders of both SAI signed a cooperation agreement in the implementation of parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="114">At the Bonn meeting in June 2009, the control teams informed each other about the initial results achieved during the preparation of the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed next procedure together.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague from 2. to 4. December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The control teams have swapped findings together until then and agreed a timetable for compiling a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of recommendations made in previous report zprávě verification of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not resolved during previous parallel inspection, • verification of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which have been classified as high risk cases, • control of the tax administration's procedure in international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, • tax checks on large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of parallel control events was drawn up during the June 2010. work meeting.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. VAT management check in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous inspection action, NKÚ recommended adjusting the conditions of VAT registration and introducing a new rule for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Modified conditions should allow more effectively to reduce the risk of possible tax evasion with VAT collection.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the financial authorities did not use the authorization to revoke VAT registration for payers who did not fulfil their obligations under Law No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter referred to as the 'VAT Act').</seg>
<seg id="127">The amendment of the provision consisting of the introduction of the duty of tax administrators to abolish VAT registration for payers during the repeated non-filing of VAT tax return has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax manager can revoke the registration of the tax payer 'ex offo' in cases where: (a) the payer has failed to carry out the tax administrator without notification of the reason for the tax administrator for consecutive months of transactions, (b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under this law, c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous inspection action, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the FÚ for Prague 1 to cancel VAT registration on 31. January of the following calendar year called. non-established payers who were not incurred during the current calendar year no obligation to admit and pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="130">FÚ for Prague 1 often did not cancel VAT registration for these payers, because the relevant provision provided for the cancellation of registration insufficient time limit.</seg>
<seg id="131">This issue has been remedied by the amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of a non-established tax payer in case the tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services in the previous calendar year or goods or services exempted from taxation with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="135">As part of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for summary reporting.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">Newly, the obligation to report summary reports in electronic form is also established.</seg>
<seg id="138">The summary report must be submitted to the payer even if there are services for which the place of delivery is determined in accordance with Section 9 (9). Article 1 (1) of the VAT Act, provided to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State and if he is liable to admit and pay tax to their recipient on such services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8 / EC amending Directive No 2008/8 2006/112 / EC as regards the place of service.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of VAT returns and summary reports to achieve greater reliability of VIES data This recommendation was related to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration conducts a comparison of data on intracommunitary transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech payers automatically in ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper VAT collection is one of the necessary preconditions for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore one of the areas of priority interest and has been given considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is testified, among others. the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, where the external evaluator tried to determine the difference between the legitimate and actually collected VAT amount in 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as ′′ EU-25 ′′) during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of loss from unpaid VAT for this period is EUR 90 billion, with on average 12 % of the eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25 I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18 %.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the context of international cooperation, it was stated in the previous control action that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and introduced in every EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">Regarding the risk management system, NKÚ has carried out a check on the EUROCANET system for information exchange in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risk intracommunitary transactions carried out by EU tax payers, included in the EUROCANET system have been selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The aims of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved by the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of responsible authorities into a form enabling fraud to be detected already in their bud.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later become an important source of information when assessing intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7. October 200812, while setting out the basic principles to follow this network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The preview of EUROFISC is an already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risk trading transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendation from the first report brought the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has established a well functioning tax payer registration system based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance alerted the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">Improvement of the system is done continuously.</seg>
<seg id="166">Currently data from the questionnaire are being processed electronically and will then serve as part of risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission has submitted a proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for tax payers registration and deregistration.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States requested further clarification and detailed development of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to secure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="172">On April 8., 2010, a law on transposition of EU directives into national law was passed.</seg>
<seg id="173">This law contains clauses on monthly submission of summary reports on intracommunitary delivery.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions took effect on 1. July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of the interconnection of both VAT returns and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group consisting of workers from the spolkových and the Federal Ministry of Finance was established.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for automatic comparison of VAT tax returns data and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the spolkových.</seg>
<seg id="180">The working group also dealt with a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for internal market transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Exchange of relevant information at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in this exchange within the so-called. risk management platforms.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and based on a written consultation of 18. October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007. action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">Members of the platform are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • acting influence, • evaluation, • risk management update.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the beginning of 2010 reports were published on the results of the activities of these subgroups.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of conditions for VAT registration and cancellation of this registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">Proposal for amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing EU databases, including VAT identification numbers database.</seg>
<seg id="191">He also adjusted common minimum standards for tax payers registration and deregistration.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issue of registration and cancellation of registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States for now.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States requested further clarification and detailed development of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8. June 2010 the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on the proposed regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States need to implement national procedures and are only required to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission failed to convince Member States of the necessity of common standards for registering and deregistration of payers, because both SAI consider this measure an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome the Commission to make further efforts in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="201">In the context of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly deadline for summary reports, allowing more timely examination of the values of intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive Article 2008/117 (2008/117) EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion related to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for summary reports of intra-EU transactions to one a month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010, Germany took effect on July 1., 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced an obligation to report summary monthly reports according to the specified calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and to consider interconnection of both VAT returns systems and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted BRH recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is ongoing so far and BRH will monitor further developments in detail.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of detecting risk-inclined traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">NKÚ has carried out a check on the EUROCANET system for information exchange in the EU (see drip. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">BRH focused on German participation in the so-called in this area. risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Subsequent inspection of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In the previous inspection action, the implementation of commercial transactions was jointly examined, where there were doubts about their implementation, or. irregularities in the way payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their tax returns to VAT or summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="214">Both inspection institutions selected nine cases involving the intracommunitary movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for subsequent inspection by tax administrations of both countries were not completed during the previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech payer bought goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer in the 1. th quarter of 2005</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in his tax return to VAT, because the German payer did not have VAT ID assigned, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">Based on international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No On 798/2003 July 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that under the German VAT law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have VAT ID assigned to intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">Follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that, based on a check carried out by the Czech tax manager, the Czech tax payer filed an additional VAT return, admitting the acquisition of goods at the said value and at the same time in this tax return, he claimed the right to deduct VAT of the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">The Czech payer was supposed to buy EUR 12 561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of these goods and did not mention VAT in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax administration refused upon request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 cooperation as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000</seg>
<seg id="224">Since the Czech tax manager did not obtain evidence, he ended the check without finding and the tax liability remained at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">Following a follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech tax manager received two spontaneous information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer bought goods from a Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in a proper VAT return for October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">The Czech payer was supposed to buy a car from a German payer in the 4. th quarter of 2004 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Czech tax payer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="230">This payer has not submitted tax returns to VAT since August 2004, so the tax manager measured VAT of CZK 0 for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">Based on information received in the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No In March 2007, 1798/2003 from Germany, the tax administrator called on the payer to submit an additional tax return to VAT, which the payer did not submit.</seg>
<seg id="232">Follow-up inspection found that the tax administrator carried out further tax procedures in 2007, which showed that the car in question sold to the Czech payer to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment for the tax period December 2004, which he additional paid VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and subsequent sale of CZK 295</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was cancelled with liquidation and a liquidator was established.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of foreclosures of the tax borrower's property, this outstanding balance appears impregnable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was supposed to deliver new means of transport (cars) to Germany during the 4. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005 totalling EUR 198 167</seg>
<seg id="238">From reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it appeared that there is an unfinished tax-criminal proceedings against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">Following a follow-up check, BRH received information that after the end of the tax proceeding in Germany, it was demonstrable to find that the German tax payer was incorporated into fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intracommunitary acquisition of goods was taxed EUR 182 424 (year 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">NKÚ found out by subsequent inspection that the Czech payer was involved in carousel shops with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information from the German tax administration regarding the verification of delivery of goods, VAT was started with the Czech tax agency for the tax period April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the inspection findings and information collected in the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additional VAT for the period May 2005, 031 CZK and 703 CZK for the period June 2005</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech payer A was supposed to buy a machine totaling EUR 58 000 from a German payer in February 2005</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was supposed to supply the Czech payer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027 in the 3. st quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that payer B bought a machine from a German company that had an organisational component established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech payer A did not show the acquisition of goods from a German payer in his VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="249">From a German tax manager's response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it appeared that the German payer did not carry out an intracommunitary delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but the supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">BRH found after the tax inspection that after the tax check was carried out, the intracommunitary supply of the machine was reclassified to supply the machine in the country and the VAT exemption was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German tax payer was supposed to supply the Czech payer with EUR 11 600 in the 3. th quarter of 2004</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were bought and sold in Germany in 2005</seg>
<seg id="254">The NKÚ subsequent inspection found that the Czech tax administrator measured the additional tax return for VAT filed, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was wrongly stated, including the acquisition of goods at the said value.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No On 1798/2003 July 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return for the German payer's VAT and additional EUR 1 600</seg>
<seg id="256">The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The summary report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, because repairs of summary reports in Germany can only be made by the payer who submitted the summary report.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 whether the Czech tax payer bought a car from a German payer in February 2005, worth EUR 47 400</seg>
<seg id="260">The Czech tax administrator, after the tax procedure carried out for the tax period February 2005, measured the Czech tax payer's tax liability of CZK 0 and told the German tax manager that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the car by a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for failure to comply with duties and the Czech tax manager sent documents to the police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">Following the check of BRH, he found that the German payer changed his seat and the new local tax manager cancelled the VAT exemption on the delivery of the vehicle to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German tax payer has not yet corrected the data in the summary report and filed an appeal against the tax manager's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to VIES data, the German taxpayer supplied goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the 1. th quarter of 2005 according to data from the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="266">Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech tax manager was trying to identify the causes of differences caused by the Czech tax payer when acquiring goods between the 3. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer repeatedly submitted additional tax return to VAT for the 1. st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the goods purchased between CZK 134 and 273 for the period of the 3. th quarter of 2004, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture the commercial transactions for individual quarter and therefore the tax manager accepted additional tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German tax payer supplied the Czech payer with EUR 46 854 in the 3. st quarter of 2004</seg>
<seg id="271">The Czech payer admitted only EUR 14 856 intracommunitary acquisition of goods in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="272">Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made in the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total value of the supply of goods EUR 31 998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT tax return and the data given in VIES I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="274">Follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech payer filed additional tax return to VAT for the July 2004 to January 2007. after many urgences.</seg>
<seg id="275">In this tax return, the tax payer also claimed the right to deduct VAT, thus the tax liability for the said tax period remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The subsequent inspection verified that most tax proceedings were completed in selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany and that tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. additional VAT or prevented tax refund on entry).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Checking selected cases of risk intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of inspection in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information for the detection of risk entities within the Member State where goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared by the local financial authorities with customer data.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting in the 1. th quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risk transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers into the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech tax entities included EUROCANET were selected for inspection as part of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as buyers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrators from other Member States were captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">Since the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained to help determine whether suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated by the German tax administration as risk entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The control action revealed cases of normal commercial transactions and cases with suspicion of involvement in carousel shops or VAT fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where relevant, tax administrators benefited from exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risk transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">The financial authorities monitor such tax entities on a continuous basis for their inclusion in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="291">• During the verification of risk transactions, the financial authorities did not demonstrate in the submitted accounting records derogations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT, despite finding irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or reveal trade relations with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• Verification of business transactions was complicated because some tax payers did not cooperate with tax administrators and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">Locally competent financial authorities mostly checked the risk tax entities and risk transactions specified in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax administrators when checking risk transactions, especially in connection with the so-called verification. missing traders, they have limited options and only from physical document control it is difficult to prove fraudulent behavior to the tax body.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stronger requirements for registration of VAT payers and more flexible cancellation of registration would help reduce missing trader scams.</seg>
<seg id="296">For tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious supply of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing formal tax documents to payers, who illegally draw VAT deductions on entry due to them.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where tax entities are suspected to involve in carousel shops and other fraud and imports and exports of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation of these institutions would help in identifying goods and irregularities in transport documentation and monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in the EUROCANET system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system, the European Parliament evaluated at the end of 2008 as a weakness of this system, which should be eliminated by the establishment of a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed information available with the Federal Central Financial Authority, which contained data from the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="303">These data were the criteria for selecting six German tax payers files for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, refused to actively participate in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has a passive status, which means it does not send data to Brussels, but is only a recipient of data from the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification of this position is contained in the following statement :. in the opinion of the government, it is not legally admissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="307">Currently there is no legal base that would allow tax information to be violated.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States within EUROCANET." 17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been analyzing data from the EUROCANET system and advancing it to the finančním's financial authorities in compliance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">German financial authorities receive control information on the direct trade relations of payers (registered with specific financial authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in the EUROCANET scheme.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, German financial authorities do not receive any information about whether such a trader from another Member State has any risk trading relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain trade relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse active participation.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result of this fact, the control in a given area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal big differences in VAT fraud detection, since the EUROCANET system is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">Tax administrations of both countries have many other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The EU Council has reached a political agreement on the proposal for a regulation, whose main contribution is to the establishment of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="318">Experience gained from the use of data from the EUROCANET system should become part of the expected VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases presented to courts at national and European level show that discussion between Member States and the Commission is probably necessary about the conditions of tax exemptions in intracommunitary transactions.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance in recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following directives are the basic regulation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive No 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims arising from operations which are part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive No 2001/44 / EC amending Directive No 2001/44 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims arising from operations which form part of the system for financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive No 2002/94 / EC 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims resulting from certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic there was Council Directive No. 76/308 / EEC implemented by law no. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44 / EC it was necessary to implement this directive into the Czech law and at the same time amendment of the said law No. 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context a new law no has been adopted 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="330">The new regulation in the system of adaptation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annex to the Regulation sets out new models of applications, which have been used since 1. 1. 2009, the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the requesting authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Guidelines for international cooperation in recovery of claims:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance is always provided only on request containing the prescribed elements;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. aid does not apply to financial claims that are in the requested State of criminal penalties;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. in the provision of international assistance for the recovery of claims shall be followed by the national law of the country which was asked for assistance;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims do not have a priority in enforcement;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. principle of exhaustion (the requesting state without success used all the applicable option to recover the claim given by its legal order).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms of assistance, namely the provision of information, the delivery of documents and self-recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending claims to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">Local competent tax authority electronic sends a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of claims together with relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance via the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance will arrange a translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it including attachments and sends to the competent tax administration of the designated state via the CCN / CSI network.</seg>
<seg id="344">Two essential requirements apply to enforcement: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and must not be older than 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse the enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving claims from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">When receiving an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm the receipt of the application as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the application, it shall inform the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the application and shall indicate the specific provisions of the directive it relies upon.</seg>
<seg id="349">This communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="350">After accepting the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify whether the application has all the elements under the law and should immediately transmit the application to the local financial authority for processing through the financial directorate.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the application for recovery is accepted, tax administrator among others find out the debtor's property, e.g. acquiring real estate cadastral extracts, checking accounts in banks, verifying vehicle registration at the DMV etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the information requested.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities, when the claim is not possible, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any amount recovered by the tax manager shall be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator enforcing foreign claims allow waiting for payment or payment in instalments if the state that asked for enforcement agrees with it.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the period of enforcement the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payment under law No. 337/1992 Coll., about tax management and fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty payment belongs to the state that applied for the enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of applications received for enforcement, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not forward local tax administrators applications for processing in a timely manner, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">Similar situation was found in international aid in recovery of claims and in case of applications received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The control action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with law No. 191/2004 Coll., because the local competent authority of the Member State did not inform the progress made in enforcement within six months of the date of receipt of the application was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>

March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, receipt or recovery, sent or received in the previous year, indicating the amount of claims covered by the application.</seg>
<seg id="364">The European Commission shall process the report on the state of recovery of claims submitted to the EU Council and the European Parliament based on the documents provided by all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="365">The inspection found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated statistics due to an error in the asset item in 2008 by 250 5 thousand. EUR, by indicating the incorrect value of the enforced VAT claim (it was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to the value in euro).</seg>
<seg id="366">This error was subsequently reflected in European Commission statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance including amounts recovered is given in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International aid in recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">Legal authorization for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive Commission Regulation of 2008/55 November 2008 (ECR) and Commission Regulation of 28. November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In the interests of more accessible wording and better clarity, the EC directive on the recovery of claims codifies Council Directive No 76/308 / EEC of 15. March 197621, whose provisions have been substantially modified several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, inter alia. for VAT recovery, income tax and capital income tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC directive on recovery of claims was transposed into German national law by law (EC) on the collection of state taxes of 3. May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany follows the German fiscal code.</seg>

<seg id="376">Administrative operations of the financial authorities follow in particular instructions for execution and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the nejvyšších's highest tax authorities regarding the principles of administrative assistance in taxation, and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general preconditions for submitting claims for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• Legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ 251 and § 254 of the German fiscal code [AO]).</seg>

<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent an application for enforcement by the German tax administration on 2. 10. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On June 3., 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application was returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified the refund by the fact that the property transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (2). e), f), g), or letters. (h) Council Directive No 2008/55 / EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax administration further stated that Article 2 (2) (g) concerns claims related to income tax and property tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly Article 3 of Council Directive 3 Article 2008/55 (2008/55) applies to income and property taxes listed in Article 1 (1) of the basic Regulation. 3 in conjunction with paragraph 3 Article 4 (4) of Council Directive 4 77/799 / EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to draw up and submit a new application for recovery with the exclusion of the property transfer tax due to CZK 61 759 and indicating VAT arrears, corporation tax and natural persons tax will be re-sent to the German tax administration.</seg>

<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the Czech tax administrator's response from 7. 9. 2007 to 11. 11. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax manager issued an execution order for a bank account with the bank on 11. August 6., but said that he had no business relations with the tax entity.</seg>

<seg id="473">On June 26., 2005, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears for VAT amounting to CZK 1 296, i.e. EUR 43 591</seg>
<seg id="474">The application from the Czech tax manager was delivered to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10. 10. 2005.</seg>

<seg id="481">The German tax administration thus considered the application for enforcement to be done.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the field of international aid in the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of handling applications for international aid in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="485">NKÚ and BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In the 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of inconsistencies in statistics decreased despite the increase in the number of applications.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important that statistics are renegotiated at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent inconsistencies, otherwise the data reported by individual EU states will not be reliable and comparable in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should report an annual number of applications and the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax etc.) also amounts of claims received by individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of statistics submitted by Member States, as this may help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that it is possible to calculate the level of recovery of claims broken down into individual Member States, both SAIs find it useful to intensify their efforts and to improve the level of recovery of claims at least to the EU average level.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit to local tax administrators applications for recovery of claims on time.</seg>
<seg id="496">Similar situation was found in applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The control action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with law No. 191/2004 Coll., on international aid in recovery of claims because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State about the progress made in recovery within six months of the date of receipt of the application.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">Procedure for the inspection of VDS is based on law No. 337/1992 Coll., about tax management and fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined the VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for business and whose net turnover for the tax period specified in the tax return of natural / legal persons amounted to 2 billion. CZK or higher.</seg>
<seg id="504">The inclusion of the tax entity among the VDS was submitted after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant taxation period, for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">The tax entity ceased to be referred to as the VDS if, in three consecutive tax periods since the end of the period when it filed the tax return based on which it was placed among the VDS, its net turnover over the tax period fell below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">The tax body was not allowed to be excluded from the VDS record without carrying out a tax check of at least one tax for one tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were checked in at least five-year periodicity by the end of 2009</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, at least once every 2 years a written assessment of the tax body must be carried out and the subsequent procedure chosen must eliminate tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The Kontrola control focuses on at least one type of tax; the tax manager usually chooses several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">VDS were controlled by specialized inspection departments, which are set up in total for 13 FÚ or by inspection staff of local competent FÚ</seg>
<seg id="511">The department of specialised inspections shall carry out tax checks within the scope established by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities operating in unusual and specific business fields;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities for which tax inspection is professionally and time consuming;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with branched territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of extensive tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unauthorized attraction of excessive deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax checks carried out by departments of specialised specializovaných checks and the results of these checks are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed amendment to law No. 531/1990 Coll., about territorial financial institutions, which consists of establishing a specialised FÚ with national scope for selected tax entities (among others) for business-based legal entities that have reached a turnover of more than 2 billion. CZK).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT checks for large companies follow the same rules as tax checks in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following rules: • German fiscal code (AO), • Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are in effect.</seg>
<seg id="524">German fiscal code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory rules on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German fiscal code in Section IV - On-the-spot Tax check. In particular, these articles enshrine rules of admissibility of on-the-spot tax checks (i.e. in the premises of the undertaking), their scope by the subject line, rules on the distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the inspection notification, the principle of control, the tax body's obligation to cooperate and the preconditions for the implementation of the final examination and the communication of the inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax checks are carried out by responsible financial authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Act on fiscal administration According to Article 5.1 (1) in custody of Article 5.1 (1) Article 19 of the law is the participation in on-the-spot tax checks carried out by the financial authorities for the Federal Central Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The participating authorities will agree together on the spot the nature and extent of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to demand that the specific businesses it select be controlled at the time it determines.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case he may declare rules on the execution and content of the inspection at the premises of these companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">The rules on tax checks According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the rules on tax checks (German shortcut BpO 2000) were approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament, where the governments of the spolkových are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative regulations apply to on-the-spot inspections carried out by the financial authorities of the spolkových and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals in accordance with Article 3 BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to follow-up (Article 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">According to Article 33.1 BpO 2000, every informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodical instructions</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, it provides additional methodology for tax administration as follows:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Uniform manual for special VAT checks in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="539">• a USLO manual that sets out methodology for the use of data on intracommunitary business relationships led by VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">• ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to business type.</seg>
<seg id="543">The Federal Ministry of Finance publishes the data.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are always evaluated in three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to check - not only big companies - must be set at regular inspection intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, checks on large enterprises are carried out on a continuous basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually announced including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that during the inspection the checks will be finalised mainly in income taxes, excise duties and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangement of the spolkových.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax seasons covered by checks usually ranges between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 forecast a three-year inspection period.</seg>
<seg id="553">The subject of the examination is all taxes given to the company.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of control of large tax agencies</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to check individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues to gain insight into how tax administrations manage VAT checks at VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">Through a questionnaire, they collected information from tax administrators on areas they consider essential for managing the issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses regarding VAT control with VDS does tax administration have available?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or record rates whereby differentiates between fighting against VAT fraud and generally VAT control?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such distinction with the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and general VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or timeliness of VAT checks (in custody for the time period of controlled transactions)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Registration of timeliness of inquiry with relevance for intracommunitary acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers is shown in ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, information registered in ADIS is also part of the type of information, how long the questioning took.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors contain only information about the average time of the last inspection (year information).</seg>
<seg id="566">This data does not provide an overview of selected inspection periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the latest period of tax measurement; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, statistics created at the Federal level for special VAT inspection services do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there any statistics or records on the nature of additional tax revenue generated, broken down for example according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net tax increase (e.g. in cases where the tax body unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only nominal tax increase (eg transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional tax revenue collection (payment due additional tax payable).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications performed, the volume of additional tax collected broken down by type of tax, according to the number of tax agencies controlled and according to the number of tax periods checked.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigation, accusation proceedings) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Time stamps and amounts of additional tax paid are registered as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics of general debt broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax found by the tax manager.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not distinguish between the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">In addition, these differences are not distinguished by most tax administrations visited.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are there areas of control that generate high additional revenue?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect tax payer for verification based on criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">This follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach of the Ministers of Finance of the spolkových and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the spolkových must register an increased tax (VAT) requirement if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case they must specify for example the nature of the measured tax increase.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What findings are the most common?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS claim unauthorized right to deduct tax on entry for supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which were not used to carry out any economic activity under Paragraph 72 (72) of the basic Regulation. 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation under Section 75 (75). 3 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (73). 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not declare VAT on output according to Section 21 (21). 1 VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It has been stated that there are no rules at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">This follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">VAT findings are not independently registered by the spolkovými if they result from VDS tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the spolkových must write the increased tax (VAT) requirement, if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Authority is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration analyse the areas of control from which high ′′ yields ′′ and produces consequences for management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they start national audits focused on risk commodities or the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection departments do not provide data on the audit areas from which high ′′ revenue ".</seg>
<seg id="602">There are various opinions on the analysis process, as well as on case management in terms of importance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional financial authorities provide special information, but its use is on the own account of the financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the replies of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of data from tax checks carried out and data from accounts - balance sheet and profit and loss accounts.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to direct the selection of cases with risk inclined.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to VAT analysis and management in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the Czech Republic is planned to set up a specialised VDS management financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">This shows that it is more difficult to perform these tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on choosing individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">Risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on adequate reference comments, expert auditors must be able to calculate the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management and adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce VAT income outages.</seg>
<seg id="616">The result will increase VAT revenue and the risk detection rate for unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel VAT management checks met the goals set by NKÚ and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">Both SAIs have better recognized each other's valid systems in the following areas: • intracommunitary transactions, • VAT risk management, especially regarding the selection of risk-inclined transactions, • VAT recovery assistance and a VAT control for large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud cases and differences in the above mentioned VAT management areas in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">Check findings were compared and best practices were identified based on them.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will become an impetus for stakeholders to start discussions on approaches and strategies within Member States, among them and at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">Extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAIs can serve as an encouragement to carry out future VAT control actions.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Komuniké</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Supervisory Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
