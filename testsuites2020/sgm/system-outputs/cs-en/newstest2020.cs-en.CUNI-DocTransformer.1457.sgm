<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel checks of the administration of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The presented material informs about the progress and results of the parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of the administration of value added tax and the use of the information system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the procedure of the tax administrators when checking the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions carried out between individual Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the VIES system enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by these payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discrepancy between the data in the VIES system and the data in the tax return for value added tax submitted by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit of the parallel audits was not only in the exchange of information on the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but especially in the verification of the use of the VIES system when auditing the application of the right to exemption from value added tax on intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained during the implementation of the parallel audits is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of other parallel audits in cooperation with audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of the parallel audits of the Value Added Tax administration for the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Audit number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of Value Added Tax and the fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “SAO, CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as “SAO SR”) concluded on 12.9.2005 the Agreement on Cooperation in Audit Activities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the Agreement was the cooperation in the performed parallel auditing operations “Value Added Tax Administration”, included in the audit plan of the SAO, CR for 2005 under No. 05/19 and “Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of Value Added Tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system on the exchange of information between EU Member Landscapes”, included in the audit plan of the SAO SR under No. 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel auditing operations had the character of a coordinated audit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated audit was prepared in the sense of the European Enforcement Regulation No. 31 for the INTOSAI auditing standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent stipulated by the concluded contract and in the preparation of a joint final report on the result of the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated audit was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “the Czech Republic”) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as “the Slovak Republic”).</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties contractually undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) electronic system and data on received and sent requests to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the Czech Republic, the audits were carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 financial offices: the Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, the Financial Office in Kolín, the Financial Office in Teplice, the Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial Office in Tábor, the Financial Office in Brno III, the Financial Office in Znojmo, the Financial Office in Zlín, the Financial Office in Šumperk, the Financial Office in Ostrava I, the Financial Office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audits in the territory of the Slovak Republic were carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Expoziturami of the SAO of the Slovak Republic Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: the Tax Office of Bratislava I, the Tax Office of Komárno, the Tax Office of Trenčín, the Tax Office of Prievidza, the Tax Office of Zvolen, the Tax Office of Dolný Kubín, the Tax Office of Košice II, the Tax Office of Košice V and the Tax Office of Michalovce.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of the audits:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel audits was to examine the procedure of the financial and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter "EU") and to examine the use of the electronic information system VIES, in particular when checking the application of the VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The audited coordinated inspection period covered the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions An electronic VIES system is in place in EU Member States to allow tax authorities to check whether the supplier has been authorised to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and to check in the country of destination whether the purchaser has duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">The VIES system is not centralised within the EU, with each Member State developing its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit found differences in national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The values of supplies of goods to other EU Member States are reported in the recapitulative statements, the values of services provided are not included in the recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="32">The data from the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with the data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States included in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the Slovak Republic, the data from the recapitulative statements submitted by Slovak payers to the tax authorities are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and the value of supplies of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of the VAT returns, which allows to compare the values stated in the recapitulative statements with the values of supplies of goods according to the VAT returns and to identify their possible differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, the values of supplies of goods and services to other EU Member States are reported summarily on a common line of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="37">As a result, in the SR, the system does not make it possible to automatically identify the differences between the values of supplies of goods according to VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the values of supplies of goods in VAT returns makes it possible to use the results of data comparisons when checking the VAT exemption of supplies of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">The delivered data from recapitulative statements submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed at the Customs and compared with the value of acquisitions of goods stated by payers from the Czech Republic and the SR in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences to check.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of supplies and acquisitions of goods must be checked by the tax authorities and transmits a list of these cases to the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that for the most significant deviations, it will be checked whether the VAT was declared at the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="43">The audit also highlighted some problems in the VAT administration system complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisitions of goods effected by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summary reports are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum period for processing and sending the data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reducing the period for which summary reports are submitted to one month together with the shortening of the period for processing them would allow earlier access to the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="46">The tax administrators would thus be able to check more effectively whether the VAT was declared at the correct amount in intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer has declared identical values of supplies of goods to the EU in both the recapitulative statement and the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">The differences between the values of supplies of goods declared by EU taxpayers and the values of acquisitions of goods declared by Czech and Slovak taxpayers were due, among other things, to the different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in the recapitulative statements, or the reporting of intra-Community supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a different quarter than the intra-Community acquisitions in the tax return of the acquirer.</seg>
<seg id="50">The unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to more effective control activities of the tax administrations of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also focused on the examination of selected intra-Community transactions carried out between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, where there were doubts about their realisation or suspicion of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of Slovakia found the following facts among others:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities reported in their VAT returns the realisation of intra-Community transactions, which did not actually take place, in order to obtain an excessive VAT deduction;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax entities reported intra-Community supplies within carousel shops, where there was a deliberate multiple reduction of the value of supplies in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers reported in their VAT returns and recapitulative reports the intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to the acquirers, who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the acquired goods;</seg>
<seg id="57">Suppliers made the intra-Community supply of goods exempt from VAT to tax subjects who were not registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In these cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">Suppliers declared in their VAT returns the intra-Community supply at a higher value than the intra-Community acquisition declared by the acquirers, while in some cases the VAT was declared at an incorrect amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">From the lessons learned in the audit operation, it emerged that the VIES system provides tax administrators with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrators should pay particular attention to rigorous verification of differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="62">Value added tax issues after the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">After the accession to the EU, internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within the territory of the EU were abolished.</seg>
<seg id="66">The VAT administrator was the competent financial or tax office until 30 April 2004, with the exception of the importation of goods and occasional bus transport in the Czech Republic, where the tax administrator was the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In connection with the adoption of the new Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”), or Act No. 222/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 222/2004 Coll.”), the administration of VAT on the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU member countries passed from the customs offices to the financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="68">The supply of goods in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of § 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">The supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU member state is the supply of goods that have actually been dispatched or transported to another EU member state.</seg>
<seg id="70">According to the provisions of § 64 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. it is an exempt taxable transaction with the right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">The supply of goods in the Slovak Republic according to the provisions of § 8 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll. means the supply of tangible property in which the ownership right is changed.</seg>
<seg id="72">The transfer of goods that are owned by a taxable person from the Czech Republic to another Member State is also considered as a supply of goods if these goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">According to the provisions of § 43 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll. the supply of goods from the Czech Republic to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the acquirer is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="74">Acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of § 16 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods that are sent or transported to the acquirer by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="75">A Czech taxpayer purchases goods at a price without VAT and his obligation in the Czech Republic is to declare VAT according to the provisions of § 25 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., if he fulfils the conditions set out in § 73 of this Act he becomes entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">Acquisition of goods in the territory of the country from another EU Member State in the Slovak Republic according to the provisions of § 11 of Act No 222/2004 Z. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property sent or transported to the acquirer by the supplier or the acquirer or on their behalf to the territory of the country from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">Tax liability in the Slovak Republic arises for the taxpayer when acquiring goods in the territory of the country from another Member State according to the provisions of § 20 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z.</seg>
<seg id="78">The payer can deduct VAT according to the provisions of § 49 of the Act No 222/2004 Z. z. if the tax is applied by him when acquiring goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State according to the provisions of §§ 11 and 11a of this Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">Trilateral trade means according to the provisions of § 17 of the Act No 235/2004 Coll. or § 45 of the Act No 222/2004 Z. trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States, where the object of the trade is the supply of the same goods between these three persons.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intracommunitary transactions means the supply and acquisition of goods effected between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intracommunal transactions effected between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="82">VIES system</seg>
<seg id="83">In order to control the application of the right to exemption from VAT in intracommunal supplies of goods, a system of exchange of information in the field of VAT has been created within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows tax authorities of the EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the taxable transaction from VAT and vice versa, whether the acquirer duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State develops its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">The national systems work on a common principle and are interconnected through a common EU communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was interconnected with an automated tax information system (ADIS), in the Slovak Republic with the application software of the tax information system (APV DIS).</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by the financial and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU member country obtains information about tax entities that it would not be able to obtain on its own without this cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is the fight against tax evasion and tax losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State establishes within the internal organisational structure a central unit in the field of administrative cooperation between EU member states in the administration of VAT, the CLO (Central Liaison Office).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (hereinafter referred to as "MF CLO") has been established, performs the duties of the CLO in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="95">The function of the CLO in the Slovak Republic is performed by the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Department of International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as "DR CLO").</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments, among other things, communicate with foreign EU administrations, especially in the area of information exchange within the framework of the VIES system, spontaneous information exchange and information exchange upon request of EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax inspections, verification of tax identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as the “DIČ”) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to verify a certain intra-community transaction or to obtain further information related to a particular tax entity, the financial and tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via the MF CLO or the DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these requests, they obtain information from the requested Member States that they can use for the correct determination of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information are sent between the CLOs of EU Member States mostly in electronic form, using the SCAC standardized form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected audit findings during verification of commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was focused mainly on the verification of selected intra-community transactions carried out between the two states and on the level of use of information obtained through international cooperation by financial or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">The SAO, the Czech Republic, requested the SAO SR to verify in 30 cases commercial transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">The SAO SR requested the SAO, the Czech Republic to verify in 10 cases commercial transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">The verification of intra-community transactions revealed, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, the Czech Republic asked the SAO SR to verify the procedure of the tax administrator, to whom a reply to the request for information was sent.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak tax office requested through the form SCAC to verify the delivery of goods (footwear) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer in the value of 2 847 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer stated the acquisition of goods in this amount only in the additional VAT return and delivered the same goods back to Slovak tax entities in the amount of 2 550 thousand CZK by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">Based on the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic, it was found that the locally competent tax office recognized the Slovak supplier in its entirety as entitled to an excessive VAT deduction incurred, among other things, on the basis of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">The tax office did not provide information about the suspicion of re-export to the tax authorities of locally competent customers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">These facts will be an incentive for further verification of commercial activities in connection with possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form for verification of the supply of a technological line to the Slovak Republic in the amount of 4 850 thousand CZK in the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax proceedings conducted in the Slovak Republic revealed that only a part of the technological line was delivered, the components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">The SAO of the Slovak Republic, when examining this case, found that the VAT on the effected taxable transaction was declared by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850,000 in the VAT return (hereinafter referred to as "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO of the Czech Republic also found that the Czech tax payer declared an excess VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 in its DAP for the aforementioned quarter, which arose from the application of the VAT deduction on the purchase of this technological line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">The Czech Tax Office concluded on the basis of the results of the investigation that the Czech and Slovak tax entities had established a business relationship for the purpose of obtaining an excess VAT deduction, questioned the realisation of the taxable transaction and did not recognise the Czech payer's part of the right to deduct the tax amounting to CZK 647,000.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">In 2004, the Slovak Tax Administration applied through the SCAC form for verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) to the Czech payer amounting to SKK 24,246,000 effected in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Slovak payer purchased these goods in November 2002 in Slovakia from another tax entity amounting to SKK 29,667,000 and subsequently sold them to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity claimed an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the Tax Administration and did not submit a DAP for the 4th quarter of 2002 or for the following period.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO found that the Slovak Tax Administration did not recognise the right to an excess deduction amounting to SKK 5,541,000 effected in the DAP for the month of 11/2002 and determined the tax liability amounting to SKK 1,750,000.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, the tax entity was not granted an exemption from VAT in respect of the export of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an order from the MF CLO to verify the value of the acquired goods for the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to VIES data, the Czech payer was supposed to acquire goods (diluent) from the SR in the value of 3,767 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, it did not submit the DAP and the VAT for the months of 7 to 12/2004 was charged to it ex officio in the amount of 0 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator asked through the SCAC form to verify whether deliveries of goods from the SR to the Czech Republic took place, in what amount and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">The Slovak tax office with local jurisdiction sent a copy of the invoice, waybills and an invitation to pay the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with the right to deduct VAT on this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administrator evaluated the reply to the request for information received from the SR as evidence that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">Based on further investigation, the tax office in the Czech Republic will ask the superior authority to review the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (particle board products) to, among others, an American company that deposited these goods in the Czech Republic in a free customs zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of this free customs zone was listed on the invoices as the recipient of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, the American company, for example, purchased from the Slovak payer particle board tiles worth 57 600 USD (at a unit price of 100 USD/piece), which it placed in a free customs zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred ownership rights to the goods to the Swiss company in the amount of 14 400 USD (a unit price of 25 USD/piece) and the goods were exported back to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the area of the free customs zone on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax administrator initiated tax inspections of the individual tax periods of 2004 and 2005 at the supplier of the goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="141">The verification of the underlying transactions was requested from the Czech locally competent tax administrators through several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">Individual answers gradually created a picture of the transactions and confirmed the involvement of Slovak and Czech stakeholders in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, the Czech Republic in cooperation with the SAO of the Slovak Republic found that in these commercial relations the value of the goods was deliberately gradually reduced several times.</seg>
<seg id="144">The tax directorate of the Slovak Republic concluded on the basis of the information obtained that in this case of carousel trade it is free price formation (i.e. the import of undervalued goods and their overvaluation by domestic companies located in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a violation of the VAT Act in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="145">Under the current legislation it is not possible to prevent the payment of excessive VAT deduction to export companies, as they meet all the conditions of the Act to exempt supplies from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">On 12 July 2005, the Czech payer's VAT registration was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="148">On 27 October 2005, on the basis of a voluntarily submitted application for VAT registration, this entity became a tax payer again.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Czech tax entity entered into the DAP for the month 8/2005 (i.e. the period when it was not a VAT payer) the value of the acquisition of goods (polygraphic printing press) from Slovakia in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to the delivery of goods from the Slovak payer in the amount of SKK 1,530,000, which the Slovak payer stated in the DAP as a delivery of goods to another EU Member State with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax administrator requested to verify the said delivery using the SCAC form, as the Slovak supplier did not prove how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, CR found that the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not reside at the address specified in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the CR by the locally competent tax administrator in order to verify the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer stated in the summary report for the 3rd quarter 2004 the delivery of goods in the amount of SKK 956,000 to the tax entity from the CR.</seg>
<seg id="156">The VAT number of the Czech entity was marked as erroneous by the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="157">A verification in the database of payers revealed that such VAT identification number was never assigned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic, it was not the delivery of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax administrator requested to verify the above mentioned facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, Czech Republic, inquired with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the tax entity stated on the invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, it did not declare the tax on received services from the Slovak entity, and it did not declare the tax on the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">Neither the local investigation nor the tax inspection was carried out at the Czech entity, its current whereabouts are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">Based on the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity became a VAT payer by law by accepting the service.</seg>
<seg id="164">A tax inspection will be carried out at the Slovak tax entity for the first to fourth quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">The Slovak tax payer stated in the recapitulative statement for the third quarter of 2004 the supply of goods in the value of 1 055 thous. to the Czech tax payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak tax payer, it was the execution of electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">It was not the delivery of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax administrator requested to verify the above mentioned facts by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, the Czech Republic inquired at the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the delivery and a local investigation was carried out at the Czech entity in order to verify the acquisition of goods from other EU member states in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="171">Based on this local investigation, it was found that the case was not really a purchase of goods, but a purchase of services, which the Czech entity also declared in the regular DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">The tax authority also found that the Czech entity did not pay the correct amount of VAT for the 3rd quarter of 2004 due to a bad procedure in the calculation of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tax entity submits an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">The SAO SR found out by a query with the locally competent tax authority that the Slovak payer misstated the provision of services in the summary report and a tax audit will be carried out on it for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech tax entity voluntarily registered as a VAT payer from 10th March 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For the 1st quarter of 2004 it submitted a DAP with a high turnover in both input and output.</seg>
<seg id="178">The locally competent tax authority initiated tax proceedings, the entity did not cooperate with the tax authority, therefore it was charged VAT in the amount of CZK 0 due to a suspicion of involvement in carousel trade.</seg>
<seg id="179">The other DAP was not submitted by this payer.</seg>
<seg id="180">Due to a failure to comply with the obligations arising from the law, the registration for VAT was cancelled as of 4th January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to data from the VIES system, this entity should have purchased goods from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 in the amount of SKK 7,846,000.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the realisation of these transactions, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="183">The SAO of the Slovak Republic inquired with the locally competent tax office that the manager of the Czech company denied the realisation of the transactions examined in a witness statement and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">On the basis of the tax procedure carried out in the Slovak Republic, the intra-community delivery to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be entitled to exemption from VAT and will be charged VAT on the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to the VIES system data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods (working clothes) worth SKK 39,970,000 from the Slovak Republic in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech payer declared the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only in DAPs for the month of 3/2005, amounting to CZK 11,292,000.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the entity in order to verify the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">As the company did not submit any documents or otherwise substantiate the realisation of taxable transactions, the tax administrator charged VAT of 0 CZK on 9 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to doubts about the realisation of the acquisition of goods, the tax administrator sent two requests for information to SR in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the reply to the requests for information, the tax administrator in SR had doubts about the realisation of business cases as well as about the realisation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administrator sent the DR CLO the initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated inspection, the locally competent tax administrator carried out another investigation concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic and at the same time an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of involvement in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions with goods (work clothes) were realized between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">The Slovak payer No. 1 supplied goods to the Czech payer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to the payer No. 3, who supplied them back to the Slovak payer No. 4 (see diagram No. 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">A)</seg>
<seg id="201">The Czech payer No. 2 was supposed to acquire goods (work clothes) worth CZK 4,847,000 from the Slovak payer No. 1 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods worth CZK 17,050,000 in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic on 25 May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="203">In reply, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the realisation of business cases as well as about the realisation of the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8 June 2005, a request for information was received at the MF CLO from the Slovak Republic concerning goods worth SKK 16,575,000, which the Slovak payer No. 1 was supposed to deliver to the Czech payer No. 2 in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak side requested to check whether the Czech payer No. 2 actually received the goods, declared in the DAP and paid the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">The official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech payer No. 2 no longer resides at the address registered in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly tax period, he submitted the DAP for the quarterly tax period.</seg>
<seg id="208">Due to this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not assess the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The chargeable event between the Slovak payer No. 1 and the Czech payer No. 2 mentioned in the request in the amount of 16 575 thousand Sk could not be verified due to the above mentioned facts.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel business in order to draw an excessive VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="211">B)</seg>
<seg id="212">The Czech payer No. 3, dealing with the purchase and sale of passenger cars, submitted the DAP for the tax period of months 1 and 2/2005, in which he declared the delivery of goods (work clothes) to the Slovak payer No. 4 in the total value of 21 935 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="213">These work clothes were to be purchased by the Czech payer No. 3 from the Czech payer No. 2 in the period from December 2004 to January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to SR, the main purpose of which was to verify whether Slovak payer No. 4 purchased goods from Czech payer No. 3 in December 2004 in the value of CZK 1,025,000 and in the first quarter of 2005 in the value of CZK 21,935,000.</seg>
<seg id="215">The response to this request for information received from SR showed that in the DAP for month 12/2004, Slovak payer No. 4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in the DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only in the amount of CZK 1,193,000.</seg>
<seg id="216">The Slovak payer No. 4 did not respond to the request to submit tax documents for the tax period of months 10/2004 to 3/2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">During a local investigation carried out in SR, it was found that the company was not located at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">The response also stated that this payer fulfilled all the characteristics of a so-called "lost company" and therefore there was a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The Slovak SAO was informed that the Slovak tax administrator sent the DR CLO the initiative to carry out simultaneous inspections with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which will be carried out at the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or disprove the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be assessed according to the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case is also being dealt with by the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="223">Conduct of the auditing operation</seg>
<seg id="224">As part of the preparation of the parallel auditing operations, in the first half of July 2005, a coordination meeting took place between representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants of this meeting became acquainted with the VAT legislation in both countries and with the integration of the VIES electronic system into the national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The outcome of the meeting was the specification of the scope of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of the auditing samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: (a) verification of the validity and correctness of the VAT numbers of persons registered for VAT in the Czech Republic or Slovakia in intra-community supplies; (b) verification of data on intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from the summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of payers from the Slovak Republic contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; (c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on executed commercial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out in relation to the volume of intra-community supplies between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic by means of the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure of information processing by tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in intra-community supplies and acquisitions of goods is illustrated by the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intra-community supplies</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer makes an intra-community delivery, he is obliged to submit SH by the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic provides in the SH summary information on his/her deliveries of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The payer in SR is obliged to enter in the SH the value of goods that were tax exempt and delivered from the territory of the country to other EU Member States for the period of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in the SH in Czech or Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities with an indication of their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Data on services shall not be included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds out that he has given incorrect data in the SH, he is obliged to file a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the payer in SR finds that the data given in the SH were incomplete or incorrect, he shall file a corrective SH before the deadline for filing the SH, after the expiry of this deadline he shall file an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system allows the exchange of information on the registration data of VAT-registered payers in the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Taxpayers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can verify whether the tax ID of the respective acquirer is registered in the given EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">Data from the submitted SH are grouped on the MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual tax ID of the acquirer.</seg>
<seg id="242">The aggregate value of all deliveries for each tax ID of the acquirer and the code of the method of delivery from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, are created.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from the L1QD files are sent to the respective EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from the L1QD files) is given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system in another Member State finds the erroneous tax ID of the acquirer in the sent L1QD files, it generates the so-called O_MCTL report, which contains all the erroneous tax ID with an indication of the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This report is then sent to the MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous VAT numbers, the VAT numbers are not registered in the given state or have never been allocated, the acquirer with a specific VAT number was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, the registration for the VAT of the acquirer was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the CR, the MF CLO transmits the data from the received O_MCTL reports to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the erroneous VAT numbers of the EU payer are used in any of the sent SH lines or subsequent SH lines, the ADIS system generates the so-called "VAT ID Doubt Notice" at the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office checks whether the delivery to a VAT registered payer in another EU Member State actually took place and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the SR, the DR CLO processes all the O_MCTL reports in the VIES system and sends them electronically to the locally relevant tax authorities together with the identification of the tax payers who indicated the erroneous VAT numbers in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities then invite the payer to submit the additional VAT number and indicate the valid VAT number, respectively the tax office verifies the supply of goods at the respective taxpayer when reporting the invalid VAT number in the submitted SH.</seg>
<seg id="253">Data on the number of incorrect VAT numbers relating to intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Of the total number of 41,728 VAT numbers of Czech payers listed in the SH of Slovak payers in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 were incorrect VAT numbers, i.e. 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number of 62,997 VAT numbers of Slovak payers listed in the SH of Czech payers in the same period, 416 were incorrect VAT numbers, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intra-community transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Czech VAT payers reported on average less incorrect VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="257">When examining the activities of the financial or tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="258">E.g.:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the tax entity's registration in the 4th quarter of 2004 at the request of the tax administration in the Czech Republic, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration in that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation revealed that the termination of the registration took place only on 1 January 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- The SAO of the Slovak Republic further found that 6 tax entities submitted SHs in which the erroneous VAT numbers were stated, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain these VAT numbers.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the Slovak Republic, the SH submitted to the tax authorities are converted into electronic form and the data from them are sent to the DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">After the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the DR CLO sends to the relevant tax authorities the so-called SH error breakdowns submitted by tax entities for the respective quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO of the Slovak Republic compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH as of 26 July 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the audit) and as of 2 February 2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the audit).</seg>
<seg id="265">The following table contains the comparison of the data.</seg>
<seg id="266">From the above data it is evident that the SAO SR's audit had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with erroneous VAT numbers (on average by 199 SH per quarter) but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in the SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intra-community deliveries stated by the payer in the respective DAP lines is compared with the value of intra-community deliveries stated by the payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should check the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the obtained data when determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, Czech Republic, found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values stated in the SH and DAP in these cases amounted to 537,231 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="272">From the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values stated in the SH and DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intra-community deliveries according to the SH as a match and set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intra-community deliveries for one quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a non-negligible amount, therefore tax administrators should not set the SH and DAP match in these cases without explaining the reasons for the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">For example, the tax administrator set the match without verification in the case of a difference in values of CZK 1,561,000.</seg>
<seg id="275">The fact that the SH for each calendar quarter was filed by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter complicated the verification of the differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="276">Tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-community deliveries given in these DAPs with the values according to SH for the first two months of the calendar quarter for payers with a monthly tax period at the time of filing the DAPs.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, tax administrators only found out about the possible inconsistency of the data in the DAPs and SHPs at the time the tax liability or excess VAT deduction was assessed or refunded.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisitions</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides information on the values of intra-community transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, the delivered SH data submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, the data are converted at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the respective period and then compared with the acquisition value stated by Czech payers in the DAP for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of acquisitions of goods reported by payers in the DAP should be in the range of the minimum and maximum converted L1QD values (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in the DAP is lower than the value L1min, a so-called verification order is generated for payers with the most significant irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">The orders for verification of acquisitions of goods are a warning of problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally relevant financial authorities, which must investigate the transmitted data.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders related to audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, CR found that in 33 cases the audited tax authorities did not verify irregularities in the values of intra-community acquisitions, which were indicated by the received verification orders.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the values stated in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases amounted to at least CZK 148,319,000.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, CR selected for the audit 533 files of tax entities for which the audited tax authorities received a verification order from the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="290">The audit found the following most frequent causes of differences between the values stated in the DAP of the acquirer and in the SH of the supplier: on the side of the acquirer (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquirer did not state the acquisition of goods in the regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer declared the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than in which it was obliged to declare the tax, in 6 cases the acquirer stated the value of the acquired goods in the incorrect DAP line, on the side of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases the EU payers included in their SH the values of the provided services to the Czech payer, of which in 54 cases the Slovak payer was involved, in 39 cases the suppliers included in the SH the delivery of goods in a different tax period than the Czech acquirers in their DAP, in 22 cases the suppliers stated in the SH the incorrect VAT number of the Czech payer, in 16 cases the suppliers stated in the SH the wrong values of the delivery of goods, in 12 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value of goods delivered to the CR before 1.5.2004, in 5 cases the suppliers included in the SH the value of received advances.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the side of the payers from the Slovak Republic, the value of provided services was included in the SH most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="292">In the audited financial offices, 54 such cases were found.</seg>
<seg id="293">For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 arose from the fact that the Slovak payer included in the SH the provision of services (construction works and supplies of goods including assembly on the territory of the Czech Republic) for the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion in the SH of the values of received advances, e.g. 2 Slovak payers included in the SH received advances from Czech payers, as a result of which the verification order for the difference of CZK 3,580,000 was generated.</seg>
<seg id="295">The verification orders for acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where there is subsequently a change in the data from the SH in the EU Member States, such as a change in the purchaser of goods in the Czech Republic or an increased value of the supply of goods to the Czech Republic, the new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">As the VIES system does not automatically warn of these changes, the locally competent tax authority of the purchaser of goods may not know about the facts decisive for correctly determining the tax liability of the acquired goods without any other incentive and there is a high probability of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">An audit by the SAO of the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">The Slovak payer stated in the SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of the delivery of goods to the Czech payer in the amount of 1,504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1 February 2005, the tax office of the locally competent Czech payer sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic because the Czech payer declared the acquisition of goods in the amount of only 425 thousand CZK.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 1 March 2005 in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand Sk and by increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the amount of 194 thousand Sk to the value of 1,160 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers reported in their SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 intra-community delivery to payers from the Czech Republic for a total amount of SKK 10,240,000 (i.e. CZK 8,183,000).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, the Czech acquirers did not declare intra-community acquisition in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, which was not mentioned in the SH filed by the Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the 1st quarter of 2005, the Slovak payers increased the value of intra-community deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of SKK 10,240,000 in the additional SH related to the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for the 2nd quarter of 2004, even though the actual acquirer did not fulfil the obligation to declare intra-community acquisition for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, Czech Republic found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the above-mentioned Czech tax payer was additionally charged VAT for the tax periods 5 and 6/2004 amounting to CZK 3,640,000 and for the 3rd quarter of 2004 amounting to CZK 3,305,000 on the acquired goods in these periods.</seg>
<seg id="308">From the above mentioned facts, it is evident that tax authorities had to examine in tax proceedings not only differences arising from errors in the acquirer's DAP, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intra-community delivery and acquisitions in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">The unification of the conditions for reporting these data would lead to more effective control activities of tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Slovak Republic, the APV DIS system allows comparing data on the value of the acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU Member States with the data listed in the Slovak acquirers' DAP.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method by which the data are compared is called the "MIN-MAX method".</seg>
<seg id="313">Using this method, the values of supplies of goods listed in the SH of payers from other EU Member States are converted at the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the respective quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">The MIN-MAX interval is created, which is used for comparison with the values of acquisitions of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">The DR CLO sends the tax administrators information on the values of intra-community acquisitions listed in the DAP and the values of supplies from the EU in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator decides which persons registered for VAT will be checked for the difference, taking also into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of the data provided by the DR CLO, the SAO SR selected 57 files of Slovak acquirers of goods from the audited tax authorities, of which 25 payers acquired goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in the DAP were found.</seg>
<seg id="318">The SAO SR's audit confirmed the fact that the tax administrators did not consistently verify the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and did not check the accuracy of the data stated in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations at specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the SAO SR's audit at the tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.</seg>
<seg id="321">Among other things, the following facts were found for Slovak companies, where the VIES system showed significant differences in the MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU member countries:</seg>
<seg id="322">In the DAP for the 4th quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not state the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic had mistakenly stated the VAT number of this payer in the SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while the goods worth CZK 19,184,000 were in fact delivered to another Slovak payer.</seg>

<seg id="351">A tax inspection was initiated for the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International exchange of information level L3</seg>

<seg id="354">DR CLO to another EU member country. The objective of the RU is e.g. to prove the execution of a given transaction in the framework of intra-community transactions, to verify a certain TIN, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the case of SPI, it is the communication of information important for the tax administrator in another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of exchange of information is regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum time limit for replying to the RU was set in Article 8 of this Regulation at 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for admissibility of requests are regulated by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15 November 2004, which stipulates that, unless the participating states agree otherwise, the STI must relate to commercial transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">If a STI relates to a commercial transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may, in view of its workload, refuse to reply.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure for processing received STIs by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including an indication of the internal time limits set for processing at each organizational level, is illustrated in the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the SR, the time limit for processing STIs by the tax authorities was set internally at 2 months, so that the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 could be met.</seg>
<seg id="362">The MF CLO received a total of 29 STIs and 3 STIs from the SR between 1 May 2004 and 30 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 received STIs, 26 (i.e. 89.7%) were discharged within the stipulated time limit of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were discharged after this time limit.</seg>
<seg id="364">In the same period, the DR CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 STIs and 7 STIs.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 RUs received, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were processed within the stipulated period of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were processed after this period (for the remaining 2 cases it was not possible to determine the period of processing from the submitted materials).</seg>
<seg id="366">More detailed data on the time of processing of RUs received by the MF CLO and DR CLO are contained in the following chart.</seg>
<seg id="367">The reasons for sending RUs, stated on the SCAC forms, are contained in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT was verified as well as the use of the VIES system for the exchange of information between EU Member States, especially when controlling the application of the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to verify selected intra-community transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="371">The examination of selected transactions revealed that on the basis of international information exchange, tax administrations of both countries detected cases of companies that carried out fictitious intra-community business transactions in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions, as well as cases where the acquirers did not declare VAT on the received supplies of goods in the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">The audit also found differences in the processing and use of VIES data by tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also pointed to problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-community supplies and acquisitions of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">The unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to more effective control activities of tax administrations of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="375">The examination of the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system revealed that the financial or tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all VIES possibilities and the relevant legal authorizations.</seg>
<seg id="376">It was also found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on deliveries of goods and on the validity of the VAT registration of tax entities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared the data on occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the audit, with the data processed after the completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="378">From the comparison of these data it was clear that the SAO SR's audit had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SH with erroneously stated VAT numbers, but also on the reduction of the number of uncorrected errors in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In case of discrepancies in the reported data, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations, or to carry out tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic, did not have such an option within the framework of the applicable legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">From the findings of the audit operation it was found that the VIES system provided the tax administrators with basic information necessary for the control of the correct application of VAT in intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">As there is still room for tax evasion in this area, it is necessary to pay increased attention to intra-community transactions in the administration of VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel Control of Value Added Tax and Excise Tax Administration between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material gives an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax and excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation between the supreme audit offices of both countries was realized on the basis of a contract on cooperation in control activities concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of parallel control actions was chosen in view of the fact that indirect taxes significantly contribute to the revenues of the state budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of the value added tax, allowing the refund of the excess deduction, provides a space for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise taxes, especially on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean a high profit for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively within the whole European Union, a working group of the VAT Working Group has been created by the supreme audit institutions of the European Union Member States, in whose activities the supreme audit offices of both countries are actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the audits carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but especially in the joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration with the aim of limiting the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gained experience and knowledge will be used in the framework of the planned audits of indirect taxes, focused mainly on the involvement of the tax administrators of both states in the VIES system, which allows to control the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the audits of the administration of value added tax and excise taxes for the years 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Audit number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Audit subject:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Audit of the tax administrator's procedure for administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="18">On February 11, 2004, the Agreement on cooperation in the audit activities between the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (SAO SR) was concluded. The subject of the Agreement was cooperation in the parallel auditing operations "Value added tax and excise taxes", included in the SAO Audit Plan for 2004 under No. 04/07 and "Audit of the procedure of the tax administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise taxes", included in the SAO Audit Plan under No. 18/2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent stipulated by the concluded Agreement and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the audits.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties undertook in the contract to provide each other with information from public sources, from the database of the customs administration and from the files of tax entities maintained by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and the tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain during the audit of the application of value added tax and excise taxes on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the respective state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were carried out in parallel in the period from January to August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "CR"), the audit was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial departments of South Bohemia, North East Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited bodies were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected financial offices: the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 3, the Financial Office in České Budějovice, the Financial Office in Frýdek-Místek, the Financial Office in Hodonín, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Kroměříž, the Financial Office in Písek, the Financial Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, the Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, the Financial Office in Velký Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">The auditing operation on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Slovak Republic") was carried out by the Tax and Customs Administration Section of the SAO of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Expoziturami of the SAO of the Slovak Republic Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">The Tax Office Bratislava for selected tax entities, the Tax Office of Bratislava III, the Tax Office of Trnava, the Tax Office of Pu-chov, the Tax Office of Banská Bystrica I, the Tax Office of Liptovský Mikuláš, the Tax Office of Žilina I, the Tax Office of Žilina II, the Tax Office of Košice I and the Tax Office of Košice IV.</seg>
<seg id="26">Objective of the auditing operation</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the audit was to verify the fulfilment of obligations of financial and tax authorities and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise taxes with a focus on the collection of these taxes on imports and exports of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of the international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the respective financial and tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Recapitulation of the audit results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of the audit activity</seg>
<seg id="32">Within the framework of the international cooperation of the SAO, the SAO SR transmitted 22 206 items of uniform customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") from the customs database of the Czech Republic on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and vice versa, the SAO SR transmitted 30 221 items of JCD to the SAO from the customs database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison of the selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was performed.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of the 5 883 selected items of the JCD from the customs database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related items of the JCD were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 12 343 selected items of the JCD from the customs database of the Slovak Republic, a total of 26% of the related items of the JCD were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="36">Based on the unassigned items of the JCD, a selection of the files of tax entities was carried out at the financial or tax offices, where the declared imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Based on the exchange of information from the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the financial or tax authorities, the realisation of the declared imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the territory of the second state.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO carried out a joint pilot audit at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, during which both parties closely cooperated in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not find any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation enabled the verification of commercial transactions carried out between business partners from both countries and pointed out deficiencies in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of the audit results</seg>
<seg id="42">In the area of international cooperation, the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic focused on imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their parts, as well as other types of goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of the audit of files of tax subjects at selected financial and tax offices, the SAO requested verification of the realisation of exports of goods declared on 40 JCD with a total statistical value of CZK 15,301,093 and the SAO of the Slovak Republic requested verification of exports with a statistical value of CZK 56,989.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic found the following facts among others:</seg>
<seg id="45">- commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic;</seg>
<seg id="46">- errors in entering data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- for some exports from the Czech Republic, corresponding imports into the Slovak Republic were not proved.</seg>
<seg id="48">In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of improper application of value added tax deductions,</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax subjects did not fulfil certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="50">- deficiencies were found in the activities of financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise taxes and in their cooperation with customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of value added tax and excise taxes, attention will continue to be paid to international trade with the aim of effectively minimising tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the work of tax authorities in the performance of the administration of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">Effective control of excise duties is based on control of document circulation, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the situation regarding value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") was levied by the tax or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out within the territory of the country and by the customs authorities on importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">The tax revenue was determined by the tax authorities by the difference between the collected own tax liability and the refunded excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="58">VAT revenue at customs offices was determined by the amount of tax collected by them.</seg>
<seg id="59">In accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, the tax collected by the customs authorities was reflected in the tax deductions applied at the tax or tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most tax and tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the key taxes in terms of state budget revenues, as it accounted for about 31% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and for about 42% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="62">The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="63">The financial and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned amounted to a total of CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">The total VAT collection in the Slovak Republic amounted to CZK 83.8 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="65">The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 187.0 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned amounted to a total of CZK 103.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise taxes (hereinafter referred to as the "CND") was carried out by the respective financial or tax authorities and the customs authorities when importing products subject to the CND.</seg>
<seg id="68">The share of the CND in the tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic amounted to about 16% in 2003 and about 19% in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total CND collection collected by the financial and customs authorities in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 85.6 billion in 2003 and CZK 38.0 billion in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. Progress of the audit operation</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation between the SAO and the SAO took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">In the first stage, the comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out, in the second stage, the results of this comparison were used for mutual verification of the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and for audits carried out on the territory of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of the audit operation</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel audits of VAT and DTC was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, among other things, the selection of commodities - types of goods that represented a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax regulations was agreed on: - alcohol and spirits, tariff headings No 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff headings No 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff headings No 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff headings No 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax subjects to be checked would be carried out: (a) from unassigned items determined by comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or in one-off large volumes, (c) on the basis of findings from inspections carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, the mechanism for the cross-referencing of JCD items registered in customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was tested on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, part of exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for the year 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, of any strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unmanufactured tobacco; tobacco refuse,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (with or without ends cut off), cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and essences;</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: For cellular networks (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: Other;</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling in subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">JCD items from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were cross-referenced on the basis of the agreement of individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle transporting the load, date of crossing the national border, tariff heading, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are given in the following tables and graphs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The cross-referencing of individual imports and exports was made more difficult by the fact, among other things, that commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD were declared on more import JCDs in the territory of the Slovak Republic, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that influenced the success of the attribution were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial or tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to certain tax entities that carried out imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, some tax entities were selected for the verification of commercial transactions reported in the VAT returns, for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot control at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing point for the execution of the pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="100">Based on a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the use of control sheets was introduced at the border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and Slovakia from 1.6.1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as much as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport transporting commercial goods in the customs area and to create conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot control was carried out from 8.3.2004 to 26.3.2004 and was aimed at examining this system of customs control.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of control sheets at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Weighing the vehicle, issuing the control sheet and handing it over to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Unloading the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking area.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs processing in the clearance hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, Police of the Slovak Republic, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The individual components confirmed the execution of the clearance by stamping in the control sheet.</seg>
<seg id="108">3) Bringing the vehicle to the physical inspection area.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the control sheet, JCD, or other documents to the customs administration employee - check the execution of all prescribed operations and documents.</seg>
<seg id="110">Performance of the physical inspection by the respective components.</seg>
<seg id="111">Release of the vehicle from the customs area.</seg>
<seg id="112">Note: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was carried out directly by the employees of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When importing goods into the Slovak Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was carried out by the employees of an authorized legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">The vehicles were recorded in the computer register after weighing.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Inspection sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="117">The inspection sample was selected on the basis of the analysis of records from the Customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the inspection sample for exports is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Inspection sheets and their registration Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="120">When exporting from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic issued and registered the inspection sheets.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these inspection sheets in the electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">From the number of 453 JCD items, the SAO found 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the staff of the Drietoma border crossing point.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">When exporting from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, the control sheets were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">From the total number of 339 JCD items of the selected control sample, the SAO in cooperation with border customs crossing staff assigned the corresponding registration numbers of the control sheets to the 295 JCD items.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 44 cases were identified in the register by the employees of the border customs crossing Drietoma and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="127">The SAO and SAO audit did not find any deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected audit findings when verifying commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified from documents of customs administrations and tax authorities in the territory of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="130">The selected tax subjects were verified:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCD were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic,</seg>
<seg id="132">- fulfilment of legal conditions for application of VAT deduction on import, refund of excess VAT deduction and application of VAT exemption on export.</seg>
<seg id="133">The verification of commercial transactions revealed:</seg>
<seg id="134">1. The SAO of the Slovak Republic requested verification of the realization of export of alcohol in the statistical value of 56 989 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="135">The SAO identified in the customs database of the Czech Republic the corresponding import in the statistical value of 42 624 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="136">2. The company dealing with import and export of photographic devices and accessories applied an excess VAT deduction in the amount of 3 740 664 CZK in the VAT declaration for the month of December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="137">In order to check the reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) in the statistical value of 1 274 822 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="138">The SAO identified 3 corresponding import JCD (17 items) at a statistical value of CZK 1,724,321.</seg>
<seg id="139">The VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="140">3. The company, whose business was mainly trading with optical devices, applied a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4,1,36,000 higher than the tax liability in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="141">In order to verify the reported trade activity, the SAO selected the export JCD (32 items) at a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.</seg>
<seg id="142">The SAO found that the import JCD (12 items) corresponded to this JCD with a statistical value of CZK 9,653,827.</seg>
<seg id="143">The VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="144">4. The company dealing with, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sales, did not report any export of goods in the submitted VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="145">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of the export of goods in 2002 amounted to CZK 3,439,888.</seg>
<seg id="146">Based on these facts, the SAO selected for verification 5 export JCDs (5 items) at a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.</seg>
<seg id="147">The SAO SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,012,656.</seg>
<seg id="148">The SAO SR audit at the relevant tax office proved the realisation of the declared imports and payment of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="149">5. The company, whose business included the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and devices, reported in the tax returns of VAT in the year 2002 the export of goods with a value of CZK 12,966,706.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the total value of exports in the year 2002 was CZK 14,474,381.</seg>
<seg id="151">The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO SR identified 13 JCDs (50 items) with a statistical value of CZK 3,621,370 in the customs database of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="153">The Slovak customs database failed to identify the corresponding import JCDs to 4 export JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 399,776.</seg>
<seg id="154">The relevant tax office in the Slovak Republic verified these imports with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity listed on the JCD as an importer to the SR expressed in the minutes of the local investigation that the imports declared on the Czech export JCDs had not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO SR therefore asked the local tax office to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="157">6. The company engaged in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and CZK 12,228,545 in 2003, according to the Czech customs database.</seg>
<seg id="158">The company did not report any exports in the tax returns for VAT in 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected for verification 5 export JCDs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.</seg>
<seg id="160">The SAO SR identified 7 JCDs (7 items) with a statistical value of CZK 2,919,514 in the Slovak customs database.</seg>
<seg id="161">The corresponding imports could not be assigned to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the Slovak customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7. The software company did not report exports of goods in the VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the Czech customs database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 amounted to CZK 1,630,198 in total.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected for verification in the SR 9 JCDs (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the Slovak customs database, the SAO SR identified 8 JCDs (8 items) with a statistical value of CZK 915,601.</seg>
<seg id="166">For the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286, the corresponding import could not be assigned in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the above cases, the corresponding imports could not be identified in the SR customs database for 6 JCDs with a statistical value of CZK 692,800.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- for 2 export JCDs from the Czech customs database with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the corresponding import JCDs could not be identified in the SR customs database (see points 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error rate in entering data in the customs database, it was not possible to identify certain registered imports, e.g. in cases where the importer's name was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (TIN).</seg>
<seg id="171">Therefore, it cannot be concluded with certainty that these exports did not take place.</seg>
<seg id="172">- to 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic in the statistical value of CZK 399,776 were not proven (see point 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that goods have been fictitiously exported for the purpose of wrongfully claiming a VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services within the scope of control of selected financial and tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the tax and customs authorities, the files of tax entities were selected at the audited financial and tax offices according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. tax subjects were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">2. tax entities were selected from the register of the tax or tax authorities according to the amount of: (a) VAT deductions applied on importation, (b) excess VAT deductions applied, (c) VAT refund entitlement, (d) VAT exemption applied on exportation,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. tax entities that have been subject to a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="180">The sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination, with a focus on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Inspection findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Inspection of selected sample at financial offices</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of the tax authorities in verifying the correctness of reported VAT,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at financial offices with a focus on comparison of declared value, application of the correct VAT rate in connection with the customs classification of goods or services, or comparison of data on the JCD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- comparison of data from VAT tax returns on performed and received transactions from abroad with data in the JCD database at financial offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- method of verification of the right to exemption from VAT when exporting goods or providing services abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT tax returns with data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at financial offices contained only records of those imports and exports where tax subjects were obliged to include imports or exports in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="192">At the audited financial offices, the files of tax subjects were examined, which declared imports totalling CZK 60 396 379 thousand in the VAT returns in 2002 and 2003 and the corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12 644 052 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, the files of tax subjects were checked, which reported exports totalling CZK 47 323 111 thousand in the tax returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the tax subjects for which the imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were examined carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic in 2002 and 2003 with a total VAT base of CZK 3 759 352 thousand, VAT of CZK 767 607 thousand and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1 989 090 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="195">The detected differences between the records in the database of JCD at the financial offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- the items of JCD that were missing in the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- the JCD items that were missing in the database of the tax offices were verified as canceled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- the JCD items that were found to have different values between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the tax offices were requested at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form, including the attached invoices.</seg>
<seg id="199">The verification revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records on import JCDs with a total value of VAT of CZK 3,622,000 and records on export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Detected differences</seg>
<seg id="201">Comparing the JCD database at the tax offices and the cumulative tax obligations for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for a selected sample of tax subjects, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="202">The differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time shift between the realisation of the imports and the exercise of the right to deduct the VAT charged on the importation of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The tax subject was able to exercise the right to deduct on the importation of goods within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary importation scheme, within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the scheme was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time shift between the realisation of the exports and the moment when the tax subject received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The tax subject was obliged to include data on realised exports exempt from the obligation to apply output tax in the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods left the country if he also had a tax document, which was the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- The failure of tax subjects to fulfil their obligations when reporting imports and exports in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax subjects did not include correct data on imports and exports in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">As tax subjects did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT returns submitted, the control of the right to deduct or exemption from VAT by the tax authorities was made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Cooperation of the financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the audited period, the customs authorities decided to refund or remit import or export duties and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax subjects were obliged by law to reduce the previously exercised right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legal regulation provided for the sending of information about changes in the amount of duties and VAT from the customs authorities to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with a considerable time delay and only from some customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information about changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the necessary data for checking the fulfilment of the legal obligation of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, the customs offices returned VAT in the amount of more than CZK 319 million and in 2003 in the amount of more than CZK 398 million.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit pointed to persistent deficiencies in the activities of tax administrators, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs administration authorities and the non-fulfilment of certain obligations of tax payers filing VAT returns and the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="219">During the administration of VAT and Income Tax Act, deficiencies were found in the following areas in particular:</seg>
<seg id="220">a) at the cancellation of VAT registrations, the fulfilment of the obligation of tax payers to pay VAT on commercial assets registered or which should have been registered at the date of the cancellation of the registration, where the payer claimed a tax deduction, was verified only rarely,</seg>
<seg id="221">b) the tax authorities did not consistently use the possibility to carry out a tax inspection or a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">This resulted in insufficient verification of the validity of the right to a VAT deduction in some cases,</seg>
<seg id="223">c) the official records and minutes of oral proceedings did not contain all the necessary data proving the validity of claimed excess VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="224">d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify imports and exports declared in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Inspection findings in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Inspection of the selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">In the selected sample, the SAO audited or the tax office carried out a tax inspection for the tax years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing the submitted tax returns and requests for tax refunds at selected tax subjects, the SAO asked the tax office to secure the relevant JCDs documenting imports and exports, invoices and proof of payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, the SAO SR audited whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and whether the decisive facts and legal conditions were fulfilled in the application of the input tax deduction for imports, in the refund of excess VAT deduction, in the application of the tax exemption for exports and in the refund of the CAS.</seg>
<seg id="230">At 10 audited tax offices, the SAO SR audited selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the structure according to the number of JCD items and the sum of statistical values given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="231">In total, imports were audited at a statistical value of 856.2 mil. Sk, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into the CAS.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were audited at a total statistical value of 176 mil. Sk, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">Furthermore, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white goods, packaging technology and software) from the EU countries to the Slovak Republic were audited in the statistical value of SKK 532.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Cooperation of tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO scrutinized tax authorities and found discrepancies between data recorded in the Slovak Republic customs database and data recorded in specific VAT returns, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax subjects (natural persons) declared in their tax returns imports of goods in the total value of SKK 1 589 261, on the basis of which they claimed a claim for refund of excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In local investigations carried out at the instigation of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, tax subjects failed to prove to the tax office the legitimacy of applying the input tax with relevant documents on realisation of imports and payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- the tax subject (s. r. o.) declared in the tax return for the tax period January 2003 the received taxable performance in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods in the value of 18 006 041 Sk and claimed the excess VAT deduction in the amount of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">The tax returns filed for the year 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchase and export in the value of 59 161 535 Sk, which arose in January 2003, was not equalized during the whole year 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the above cases, the SAO SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax inspection of the applied excess VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax subject (s. r. o.) declared in the tax returns for the tax period January to June 2002 the export of goods in the total value of 87 199 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="242">A verification in the customs database of the SR revealed that the tax subject made exports in the statistical value of 296 747 Sk in the indicated period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The tax office carried out several local investigations at the registered office of the company, which found that the company's manager (a citizen of Great Britain) had travelled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease agreement in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of the audit, the SAO SR filed a report with the law enforcement authorities on the suspicion of committing a crime of non-payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on the results of the audit at selected tax authorities, the SAO SR finds that the biggest problems in the performance of the administration and control of VAT and VAT were found mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- failure to use the possibility to carry out the tax audit of VAT on problematic tax entities, especially in cases of application of a high value of excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="247">- the tax audit reports did not contain an inventory of audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD on import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient verification of declared import and export of goods in the tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy proceedings of tax administrators when issuing decisions, especially in the context of the assessment procedure, with the consequence of the extinction of the right to assess sanctions,</seg>
<seg id="251">- failure to comply with legal conditions when granting deferments of payment of taxes,</seg>
<seg id="252">- failure to compensate VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excessive VAT deductions,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">Based on the audited shortcomings, the SAO asked the relevant tax authorities to perform VAT tax audits focusing on the justification of applied excessive VAT deductions for 14 tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="255">At all audited tax offices, measures were taken to eliminate the audited shortcomings, whose compliance will be monitored and audited by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation enabled the verification of commercial transactions carried out between business partners from both countries and pointed out shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The inspections also revealed persistent deficiencies in the fulfilment of the obligations of VAT and VAT payers, in the activities of the financial and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the effectiveness and efficiency of tax inspections.</seg>
<seg id="259">The findings also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have at their disposal within the tax information system basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic. In SR, there is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT and VAT administration was not the same due to the different legislation and conditions in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained at the Czech Customs Administration and from documents available at audited financial offices. The SAO verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="262">In case of detection of irregularities, it asked tax authorities to perform tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="263">The performed parallel audits in the area of VAT and the VAT administration evaluated the state of administration of these taxes in the period before the accession to the European Union and pointed out the necessity of further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further deepened in the auditing of the activities of financial and tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of the so-called summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This report must be submitted by all VAT payers who carried out the delivery of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are obliged to enter the data from the summary reports into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) system, which is accessible to tax administrators from the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="268">The financial or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare these data with the data provided in the submitted VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is further used to verify the validity of the VAT numbers of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the applied VAT exemption in the case of a supply of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel audits showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these audits will be confronted with the outcomes of the upcoming audits, which will focus, among other things, on the verification of the VIES system, which is supposed to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-community supplies".</seg>
<seg id="272">Due to the importance of VAT and the Internal Revenue Act for budgetary revenues, it is necessary to focus the auditing activities mainly on monitoring and identification of risk areas in order to limit the scope for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the Results of the Control in Asylum Facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State Property and Funds Intended for Securing the Activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Control Action No. 04/23 "State Property and Funds Intended for Securing the Activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior"</seg>
<seg id="4">Control Action No. 15/2004 "Control of hospodárenia with state property and financial prostriedkami Intended for Providanie of Asylum and Temporary Refugee Cudzincom in the Slovak Republic"</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the phenomena of a global nature and has become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its cause is mainly the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, especially for reasons of race, religion, nationality, politics, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their aim is to obtain asylum and integration into society, especially in one of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">A large group also consists of foreigners whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the Geneva Agreement of 1951 and the New York Protocol of 1967 on the legal status of refugees, by accepting them, the governments of the signatory countries undertook to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation, already brought about the establishment of specific principles of assistance to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republics ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the adopted international documents and confirmed their binding force within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both Republics also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are contained in a joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">The cooperation between the supreme audit offices of both countries was implemented on the basis of the "Agreement on Cooperation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Agreement, both parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing the asylum procedure in the other Contracting Party's State, selected statistical data concerning the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The parallel control action sought to identify the same problem areas and to point out the consequences arising from this for the area of population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of control actions, in the exchange of information within the scope of the Treaty and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the controls.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, the same audit areas and control procedures were established in the preparation of the control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting, which took place from 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, the common points for the programme of the control action were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the third joint meeting, which took place during the control action from 8.11. to 10.11.2004, the experience of the ongoing controls was exchanged.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of the outcomes of the controls were specified and the structure and content of the joint final report, which was prepared from 14.2. to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting, were provisionally established.</seg>
<seg id="24">The controls were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, the control was carried out by the inspectors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="26">The auditees were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "MoI") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the "SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic, the audits were carried out by the Section of Defence, vnútra and štátnych úradov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The auditee was the Migračný úrad of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "MoI").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistical data for a longer period are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of the results of the audits</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Evaluation of the auditing activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of the audits carried out in parallel were: - the asylum process, - asylum facilities, - the management of state funds and property, - the internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of gained experience between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of the auditing operations.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange made it possible to evaluate the submitted documents more thoroughly, to analyse the causes of the detected differences in the security of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, it was possible to concentrate on the decisive problems affecting the activity of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the end, this had a positive effect on the quality of the implementation of control activities.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union (EU) documents has been the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation regulating this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU, with the aim of further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has been steadily increasing, with a significant increase in applicants occurring in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security for asylum seekers in the sense of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary financial resources for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is influenced in particular by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until asylum is granted or not granted, as well as by the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some of the benefits collected is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established asylum facilities in which they have gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="48">The asylum facilities provide accommodation, meals, health care and basic material equipment and sanitary needs for the duration of the stay of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, leisure courses are organised and the conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="50">The asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, and in the Czech Republic, integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The costs per stay day depend on the occupancy and equipment of the centre and are comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1 000 places in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, whose increasing number is expected to continue in the following years in connection with the application of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the largest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the provision of services. The decisive expenditure of this item was expenditure on accommodation and catering for applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditure on health care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and insurance premiums also contributed significantly to the total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of the migration policy and asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed the legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services contributed to a decisive extent to the drawdown of current expenses.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic drew attention to some similar deficiencies that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of state property.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were deficiencies in particular in the area of the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the Act on the State Budget, when ordinary expenses paid for actions having the character of technical evaluation of long-term tangible property.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Act on Accounting in the area of inventory was also violated and in the failure to comply with the chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the management of State property when it was handed over to another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Act on the Land Register was violated by failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in the Land Register data and the Act on Waste was violated by handing over waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorised for waste management.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, deficiencies were also found in the provision of unreasonably high advances for electricity and natural gas consumption, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of State property when its registration was not sufficiently ensured and the method of disposing of unneeded assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system was ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the sense of the generally binding legal regulations that govern the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">The submitted written documentation did not reveal any deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="67">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, despite some deficiencies found, evaluate positively the procedure of SUZ and MU in providing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the findings gained during the audit, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic note that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the respective organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks related to the care of asylum seekers to an adequate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the audit were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the respective organisational units of the state on both the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that positive methodological experience from the audit be used in other joint control actions within the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the subsequent New York Protocol of 1967).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Czech Republic, Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and on the Amendment of Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the creation of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the field of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding force.</seg>
<seg id="79">Already within the framework of the adoption of this Act, efforts were made to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of the issue of asylum from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became part of Community law from 1.5.1999 on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift triggered the need to create appropriate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in appropriate legal binding force.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents was the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community regulations in the area of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and their transposition deadline had not yet expired at the time of the Supreme Audit Office's audit, the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="84">After their implementation into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it has implemented the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of the state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1.1.1996 by the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No.283/1995 Z. z., o utečencoch.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Act on Refugees has been replaced by the Act No.480/2002 Z. z. on Asylum and on Amendments to Certain Acts, in which the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with the Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/EC of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of efforts between member countries in receiving such persons and bearing the resulting consequences has been incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments to Act No. 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which entails further harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with the EU legislation in the area of migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course on the basics of the Slovak language during their stay in an integration centre, the designation of a guardian by the courts for foreign minors if they reside in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, the possibility for applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances specified in the amendment to the Act.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with the EU law in the area of migration and the asylum process was evaluated in the regular reports of the European Commission on the preparedness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report drew attention to the lack of staffing capacity of the Ministry of Interior, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, refugee matters have been the responsibility of the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 January 1996, the Ministry established the organisational component of the State of SUZ. This was due to the separation of the performance of the state administration in the field of asylum procedure, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the Ministry, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services for the Ministry of Interior to participants in asylum procedures and asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Interior performs crucial tasks in the field of the asylum process, especially in terms of the financial and material-technical provision of the asylum process, to the extent defined by special regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of asylum applications by foreigners at the first stage of the administrative procedure and the complex operation of asylum facilities in the field of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material provision of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it prepares concepts on the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the field of asylum system development in the Slovak Republic in recent years were significantly influenced by the cooperation and support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</seg>
<seg id="99">A particular benefit was its financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing stock for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sports activities for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the chart.</seg>
<seg id="103">A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and an increase in the number of refugees from Chechnya manifested itself in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="104">An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the audited period, asylum was granted in a total of 394 cases, of which 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">In the audited period, asylum was not granted in total in 22 731 cases and in 22 636 cases the asylum procedure was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of participants in the procedure as of 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been issued with a decision and those who have not been handed a decision.</seg>
<seg id="108">Also included here are persons who have been forgiven for missing the deadline for lodging an appeal, or who have had a previous decision revoked and have not yet been issued with a new one.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is on a steadily increasing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">While 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10 358 persons.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8 131 applicants were registered, which represented an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1 556 persons applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">The data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic in the audited period are given in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">In the audited period, a total of 49 asylum seekers were granted and their number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in individual years.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum procedure was stopped in a total of 23 088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">The majority of applicants voluntarily left the asylum procedure before its completion by staying away from the asylum facility without permission.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003 it was already more than 94% of persons.</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of stay of one applicant in one of the asylum facilities, converted to an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The findings of the Ministry also show that for most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic it is a search for better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which is not supported by documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.</seg>
<seg id="120">In these cases the asylum system is used by applicants for a purpose.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not a reason for granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an application should be assessed as manifestly unfounded under the provisions of § 12(1)(a) of Act No 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum, and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognized principles for identification of economic migrants, which would distinguish them from applicants persecuted in the country of origin and which would make it possible to speed up the asylum process, have not yet been established.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country from the point of view of international migration, and the destination countries of migration have been and remain Western European states.</seg>
<seg id="125">Upon accession to the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the state responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents the submission of multiple targeted asylum applications in more than one EU country.</seg>
<seg id="127">After positive identification in the EURODAC system, applicants return to the country of first registration.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the external borders of the EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants in the following period, who will need to create conditions for their stay in the Slovak Republic until a decision is taken on whether or not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Drawing on funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security for asylum seekers in accordance with international agreements and the national legislative regulations based on them.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on granting asylum, as well as their state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The increasing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher uptake of statutory benefits for applicants, such as food expenses, pocket money, expenses for basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic, during the audited period, meals were CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money was CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The costs per asylum seeker per stay day were on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to pocket money, asylum seekers accommodated in residential centres with independent cooking and applicants accommodated privately outside asylum facilities can be granted a contribution up to the minimum subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, among other things grants municipalities the right to a contribution to reimburse costs incurred in connection with asylum facilities on their territory in Section 84.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the allowance was set annually by government resolutions and in the audited period was CZK 7 per person per day of stay.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are granted a contribution to reimburse the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil per month in the audited period, provided that in the given month the person attended school for a minimum of 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, in the audited period, the meal allowance was SKK 70 per person per day, pocket money was SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 per child up to 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per day of stay was on average SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">Municipalities on whose territory an asylum facility is located are granted a contribution to partially reimburse the expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility, in accordance with Act No 480/2002 Coll., on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="145">Municipalities have so far only partially used the possibility to apply for the contribution, which is set at 1 500 Sk per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries provides for a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure for issuing an asylum decision, while allowing for an extension of this period in justified cases.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the level of state budget expenditure, is the lodging of appeals against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days from the date of lodging the asylum application (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year from their start.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years from the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, up to 90% of applicants who were not granted asylum use the legal possibility of extending the deadline by lodging an appeal with the court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases, this was an extension of more than one year and the proceedings were not completed at the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="154">Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint offices of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Úrad hraničnej a cudzineckej polície Policajného zboru in reception centres in Adamova-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Liptovské Vlachoch, which was joined at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This is supposed to simplify the procedures and shorten the time limits of the proceedings between the two parts of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for providing services to participants in the asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="158">The asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket money and basic material equipment and sanitary needs during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, courses are organized as part of leisure activities and the applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing the state's property in the premises of the reception centre Vyšní Lhota, the reception and residence centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of § 80 paragraph 3 of Act No 325/1999 Coll. on Asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the accommodation centres is 1 977 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities that asylum seekers are not allowed to leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception operations referred to in Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum have been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="166">Infringement of the obligation to stay in the reception centre is classified as an offence.</seg>
<seg id="167">The accommodation centres to which asylum seekers come from reception centres are used for housing asylum seekers until the decision on their application to grant or not to grant asylum becomes final.</seg>
<seg id="168">Under certain conditions, asylum seekers have the possibility to leave the accommodation centres or to stay in private.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, provision of meals, other services and pocket money in the reception and accommodation centres in which they are reported to be staying, provided that they have suffered the acts necessary to establish their financial and financial circumstances, and these conditions are such that even partial reimbursement of the said services cannot be fairly claimed from them.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration asylum centres are used for the temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months, with the possibility of extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or they can provide it themselves within the framework of the state integration programme.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients cover all the costs of accommodation and eat individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with recognised refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">For the comparison of asylum facilities, the cost per physical stay day was chosen as the best indicator.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of persons who were actually provided with services provided by the asylum facility each day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and in the graph, the facilities operated by SUZ are marked as own and those operated by legal persons on the basis of Section 80 of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contract.</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost per stay day in the own asylum facility operated by SUZ decreases with the increasing load capacity of these facilities. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of running the facilities are allocated to more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionately with their increasing number.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, the own asylum facilities accommodated applicants in crisis capacity.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, extra accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was even used to address the capacity crisis of asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">Expenditure per applicant per stay day was lower in these years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, long-term maintenance of high filling capacity of these facilities is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated demand for higher accommodation capacity must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments when the accommodation capacity is fully occupied.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum facilities operated under contract allows the adoption of operational solutions in the area of asylum facilities capacities if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Ministry has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the Brezová pod Bradlom residential centre.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of reception centres is 470 places and the residential centre 100 places.</seg>
<seg id="192">The increasing number of asylum seekers was solved by the Ministry by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava with a flexible available capacity of 250 to 940 places.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the concluded contract, the renter also provides services related to the operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this form, the Ministry solved the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in the rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 places.</seg>
<seg id="196">The reception centres had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% during the audited period, while the residential centres had an average occupancy rate of 33% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="197">The occupancy rate varied according to the time of year and was highest in the last months of the year when a much larger number of asylum seekers applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">A further increase in accommodation capacities of about 450 places will be possible after the reconstruction of the centres in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>

<seg id="200">5.2.1 Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the costs of running asylum facilities are given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another entity, which will provide premises and ensure the running of the facility, including related activities, is one of the options to ensure the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic at a reasonable cost.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of State Funds and Property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of Management</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, in 2001, the approved budgetary expenditure of SUZ was increased by thirteen budgetary measures by CZK 103 077 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of this, CZK 89,979 thousand (87.29%) were earmarked funds. The bulk was intended to deal with the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538 thousand) and to provide health care provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, the expenditures of SUZ were increased by 20 budgetary measures by CZK 88,362 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of this, CZK 62,282 thousand (70.48%) were earmarked funds, of which the bulk (CZK 53,200 thousand) was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, the expenditures of SUZ were increased by 14 budgetary measures by a total of CZK 88,078 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of this, CZK 82,000 thousand (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51,000 thousand was intended for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000 thousand for dealing with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000 thousand for the humanitarian evacuation program of disabled residents of the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">An overview of the use of selected expenditures of SUZ in the audited period is given in Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">From the above overview it is clear that the largest part of the expenses was spent on providing services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenses incurred on the purchase of services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of the total expenses.</seg>
<seg id="215">The outrageous expenses in this item were expenses for accommodation and meals of asylum seekers in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenses for medical care provided to asylum seekers and costs of permanent security service providing security in individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) accounted for a significant share of the total SUZ expenses.</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, purchases of materials (approximately 14%) accounted for a significant share of the total SUZ expenses, with the largest share of these expenses having been the purchase of food (7.61% ? 9.83% of the total expenses).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budget management of the Ministry of Interior for securing migration policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">The draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part was characterised, especially in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the requirements of the Ministry of Interior, which were based on the increase in the number of asylum seekers and on the need to finance their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, especially in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter addressed the disproportion during the year with several budgetary measures, increasing the limit of current expenditure by 41.8% in 2001 and by as much as 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">An overview of the execution of selected expenses of the Ministry of Interior in the audited period is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums in the range of 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services in the range of 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure accounted for a significant share of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">More than 10% were expenditures on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% were expenditures on food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another significant part was expenditures on accommodation and catering services ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">A relatively low share in the range from 1.03% to 6.25% were capital expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Detected deficiencies</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar deficiencies that did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and property.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were deficiencies in particular in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the Act on the State Budget, when current expenditures were paid for actions having the character of technical evaluation of long-term tangible assets; (b) violations of the Act on Accounting in the area of inventories and in non-compliance with the indicative chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">Furthermore, in the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the management of State property, when it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Register data violated the Act on the Land Register; failure to leave waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorised to handle waste violated the Act on Waste.</seg>
<seg id="230">Furthermore, in the Slovak Republic, deficiencies were found in the provision of unreasonably high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in public procurement and in the management of State property, when its records were not sufficiently secured and a method of liquidation of unneeded assets was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the provisions of Act No 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, continuous and subsequent control, was introduced at SUZ on 1 July 2002.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was introduced and an internal auditor of SUZ was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year, SUZ is issued a plan of financial, social and operational technical controls aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">In 2002, 42 management controls were carried out and in 2003, 54 were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct performance of control activities in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic with regard to compliance with generally binding legal regulations and internal regulations is ensured by the Office of Control of the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="237">During the audited period, the performance of tasks in the field of asylum policy was not audited.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system of the Ministry of Interior is focused mainly on carrying out preliminary and interim financial control according to Act No 502/2001 Coll., on financial control and internal audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of financial control is also regulated by the internal regulations of the Director of the Ministry of Interior.</seg>
<seg id="240">The substantive focus of the control activities as part of the management of individual departments was determined in the framework of the annual plan of the Ministry of Interior.</seg>
<seg id="241">The directors of departments were designated as responsible for the performance of the control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the submitted written documentation, no deficiencies were found.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since the date of the Regulation of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic No. 28 of April 23, 2004, the Ministry of Interior is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.</seg>
<seg id="244">The organisational security of this task will need to be solved in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint Report on Parallel Controls of Expenditure on the Prague – Dresden Motorway Construction</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory statement</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, it would be difficult to imagine a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe.</seg>
<seg id="4">High-quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and increasing the standard of living of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating the conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and goods is an important task for the state administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a very demanding task, both organisationally and technically, as well as financially.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts at sustainable mobility often find it difficult to compromise with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Transport infrastructure construction, thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, is financially demanding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considerate procedures and decisions by the state administration in preparing and acquiring transport constructions can bring significant savings of public financial resources, which can be used in other ways for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of audit institutions is to actively search for deficiencies that led to lower-than-achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures on transport infrastructure constructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Audit institutions should not only alert the state administration to the detected deficiencies, but recommend measures that will lead to improvement of the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short summary</seg>
<seg id="13">The two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic) the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) carried out parallel audits of expenditures on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway (the D8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany) in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">The motorways are connected by a border bridge, which is co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough audit of the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on the close cooperation with the SAO, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the level of German costs of bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction process, the deadline for completion was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the award procedure, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made errors, which led to an extension of the competition period and a shorter construction period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the framework of the joint audits, the prices of bridges on the D8 and A17 motorways were compared, based on the calculation of the square metre area of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">Statistical analysis of the prices allowed to identify bridges with high costs per square metre of area.</seg>
<seg id="25">The analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in the group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the analysis of the tunnel construction costs, the auditors found that the tunnel prices on the D8 motorway were significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">BRH and the SAO now have a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels on which they will be able to rely in future checks of the efficiency of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, the two auditing institutions recommend: standardization of the bridge construction and the use of combined steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The main features of the cooperation included its team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel inspection, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report reports on the progress and results of the parallel audits of funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The audits focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenses incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel audits were carried out by BRH in Germany and by the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel audits were carried out in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately EUR 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, EUR 64 million from European funds (ISPA) were planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to the parallel audits carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to approximately EUR 670 million, of which EUR 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – Central and Southern parts of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 motorway runs from the state border of the Czech Republic/Germany to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of the audits, the border sections of the two motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is completed as far as Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D 8 motorway it is not completed because the section No 0805, which is 16.4 km long across the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice, is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, the section No 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Bohemian Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts carried out in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity on the border section No 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22,940 vehicles per day in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity on the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Contract between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic for the interconnection of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway on the common state border by the construction of a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, therefore the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel controls carried out by the two audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and the SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid-2005, the two supreme audit institutions have been discussing close cooperation in the control of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">The SRN is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction is based on the RMD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out the control of this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used in a cost-effective manner with regard to the overall level of the costs of bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to make sure that the expenditures were effective with regard to the main technical parameters of the motorway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow for the same quality of travel on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After the preparatory negotiations, the Agreement on the Coordinated Inspection of the D 8/A motorway 17 was signed by the presidents of both supreme audit institutions on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">The joint working meetings of the auditors of BRH and the SAO took place at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks throughout 2006.</seg>
<seg id="65">The meetings dealt with current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for the control of the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the inspection of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">An important sign of cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on the comparison of technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the tendering procedure, the SAO prepared for the most part the methodology for the control of the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable legal standards for control in the state administration differ in the way the auditing operations are concluded in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two supreme audit institutions drew their own audit conclusions on their findings obtained during their audits.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved during the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will be concluded by the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the Border Bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in a contract from 2000 on a date of completion of the construction of the border bridge in 2005, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="74">Both parties then agreed to postpone this date until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as an investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The SRN contributes financially to the construction of the bridge from 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed on a coupled steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This decision was justified by the reduction of the number of double pillars from seven to five and the consequent environmental benefits of such a solution for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">Moreover, comparative calculations carried out by the RMD indicated that the combined steel-concrete structure should be a less costly option.</seg>
<seg id="81">However, there was an error in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was stated that the new combined steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the border bridge contract, the RMD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It did not prepare the contract documentation adequately describing the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for comparing the bids.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to the evaluation committee and the general manager evaluating the bids in a subjective and problematic manner.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful bidder challenged the results of the contract procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition led to the contract for the construction being signed later than originally calculated.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after the evaluation of the bids, was wasted and the construction period shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The procedure offered included the double assembly of the bridge superstructure, a change in the structure of the pillars and the installation and fitting-out of the assembly area.</seg>
<seg id="92">Moreover, the construction company was not able to procure the type of steel originally proposed in due time.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a higher price of about €4 million, which had to be fully paid by the RMD – allowed for a shortening of the time to perform corrosion protection, which in turn allowed for a shortening of the total construction period of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably due to the accelerated procedure and other modifications in the financing.</seg>
<seg id="95">The shortened construction period led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Currently, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, not taking into account the automatic price increase (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices</seg>
<seg id="98">The two supreme audit institutions carried out an analysis of bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 motorways in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, the tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify the relevant prices accurately.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two supreme audit institutions set the following principles for comparing bridge prices: to base the actual price paid for the bridge excluding value added tax (VAT rates differ in the Czech Republic and the SNR and are subject to changes); not to take into account the prices for the special foundations of the bridge; to convert the prices in CZK into € according to the European Central Bank rate in force on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On both D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of different constructions (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, combined steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure the homogeneity of the constructions examined, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges on both sides of the border were by far the most common type of construction (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the number of bridges allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.</seg>
<seg id="109">The inspections found that the prices per m 2 of concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depended on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">In the case of German bridges, the dependence of the price on the size was stronger than in the case of Czech bridges (see the graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges on A 17 and four on D 8 were identified, the price of which is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">In order to find these bridges, a method was used to identify atypical values in a set of numbers, on the one hand, and a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (the distance from the regression curve upwards is decisive for the determination of atypically expensive bridges).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypical high price of these bridges should be considered only as an indicator of which bridges should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each identified case should be analysed.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or also environmental protection requirements or other plausible reason.</seg>
<seg id="116">Considering that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis of lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this state of affairs were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of the contract for a part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized firms do not participate in such a tender because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic, there is more variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction is decided long before the bridge is built.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is taken at the time when the SAO submits the application for a zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time, the SAD selects types of bridges from several variants, but economy plays a smaller role in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could be reached only on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction works market in both countries, which would go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, the prices of tunnels on D 8 were found to be twice as high as those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, a comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of tunnels on D 8 with those in Germany did not show any substantial difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the tunnel construction sector in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the Dresden-Prague motorway construction</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">The government approved the concept of the motorway network development in the same year.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be acquired before the border section No 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 motorway as part of the programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme No 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/Germany" set two objectives for the construction of the D 8 motorway:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">to improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – a national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">to improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the framework of the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin – Istanbul – an international objective.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Highlands was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be added that the completion date is not identical to the date of commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Highlands is now at the stage of an official zoning decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists challenged this decision with legal actions.</seg>
<seg id="151">The legal action is not final.</seg>
<seg id="152">It cannot therefore be excluded that the section leading through the Czech Central Highlands will be completed several years later than indicated in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of the section No 0805 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of the above mentioned facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD carried out an estimate of capital expenditures for the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains in the years 1999-2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate of the capital expenditures included in these capital expenditures amounts to about 639 million € for both sections No 0805 and No 0807 together.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR = internal rate of profitability)</seg>
<seg id="158">All considered motorways and expressways opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All considered motorways and expressways opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All motorways and express roads under consideration opened, both sections of D8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and the section through the Bohemian Central Highlands would be completed on time.</seg>
<seg id="165">However, at the time of the inspection, it is clear that the section through the Bohemian Central Highlands will not be opened at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above mentioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections, net of VAT, calculated as at 31.12.2005, was €897 million, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the cost level worked out by the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more expensive route, which would affect the above mentioned economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but the study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains calculates traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the limit of economic viability.</seg>
<seg id="171">With a higher load on bypass routes for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above-mentioned decrease in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 should have had will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">Also during the construction of the A 17 motorway, there were similar cost overruns as in the case of these two sections on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the federal road development plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany projected costs of about 320 million €.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost/benefit ratio was then 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, the cost had risen sharply to about €670 million and the cost-benefit ratio had been more than halved.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to the parallel inspection carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">The BRH found that the competent state approval authority had requested an off-road tunnel for the third section of the A 17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the auditing operation, the BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">The result was savings, which amounted to about €10 million in construction costs alone and €0.15 million in annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When assessing the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project had not been properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">In the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not carry out a survey of the bedrock conditions in the Dölzschen rocks, as the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was carried out only after the tunnel digging machine had hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks were more weathered inside than anticipated during the tender.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injection and safety nets against falling rocks had to be taken, which cost about €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Road and Motorway Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations such as safety measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also of measures that would not have been necessary if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training of drilling staff (€0.5 million) and increasing wages and expenditure on goods due to the project's exceeding duration (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to about €10.7 million, which did not correspond to any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">Based on the lessons learned from this and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction works.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Federal Ministry should give the road and motorway directorates the necessary impetus to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and the SAO The cooperation fulfilled the intention of both auditing institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained audit knowledge about the preparation, assignment and progress of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">Both supreme auditing institutions built a database of bridge and tunnel prices on which future audits could be based.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main construction and technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway did not differ from the parameters of the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">Auditors of both institutions involved in the cooperation gained new experience which can be used in further audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects implemented under the Cross-Border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The developing community of Europe's population is a driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">So let this community give an introduction to this joint report by the two supreme audit institutions of neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (or 37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often a relic of the darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover maritime areas, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programmes are bilateral, but some also cover more than two neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes run for seven years and receive a total of €5.7 billion from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The programmes include the following activities: repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycle paths and bridges, investment in cross-border waste management systems, medical facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of common services for local populations, advice on employment issues, creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is provided on the condition that organisations from both sides of the border (e.g. regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to carry out projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of the cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects are to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself ends.</seg>
<seg id="15">Funding is provided on the condition that project partners from both sides of the border work together in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characteristics: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing.’</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership are: joint choice of the lead partner, joint project preparation and applications, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assumption of overall responsibility for project implementation by the lead partner, total payments of support are received by the lead partner and transferred to the respective project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects implemented on the territory of the regions and voivodships adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007–2013 (OPPS ČR–POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">258,187,467 € were earmarked for the implementation of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from European Funds (ERDF) totalling 219,459,344 € (85 %) which must be used by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial data on the drawdown of EU funds from the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007–2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The Agreement on Cooperation between Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAIs) and the Republic of Poland (SAIs) was concluded by the presidents of both authorities on 27 February 2013 after previous mutual negotiations at the meeting of the Heads of Supreme Audit Institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to verify whether the implementation of the Operational Programme proceeds in accordance with legal regulations and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system works reliably, whether the objectives of the Operational Programme are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the established conditions of the provided support.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel audit, in which the Audit Authorities, based on their legal mandate, independently examined topics whose content had been jointly discussed beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="27">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit also included elements of a performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects at project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The results of the audits were audit conclusions published in the usual manner by both Authorities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Based on the two audit conclusions mentioned in the annex, this joint report was created.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint audit sample included six projects (Annex 1) which fall within the support area 1.1 – Strengthening transport accessibility and support area 2.2 – Supporting tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Before the start of the audit, the drawing of funds from these two support areas represented more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the whole OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to the audit of a joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and NIK audited another two (all from the support area 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to beneficiaries from the ERDF, which were audited by the SAO and NIK, totalled 25,362,174 € (SAO) and 8,450,784 € (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited amount of funds represented 41% of all funds paid to beneficiaries from the support areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both audits carried out independently by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of significance.</seg>
<seg id="40">Implementation of the OPPS CR–POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited persons, who were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and non-use of the provided funds from the ERDF.</seg>
<seg id="42">Proof of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the stated objectives, which was supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THE CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Evaluation of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out the control of the management and control system of the OPPS CR–POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Regional Development of the CR), the national coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development of the POL) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodship).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the joint technical secretariat and the monitoring committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on activities carried out in connection with the setting and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, especially in connection with the setting of programme objectives and monitoring of the achieved progress, evaluation activities and annual reports, the assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, drawing of programme funds and fulfilling the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on grants, the control activities of the managing authority, setting of performance of activities and outcomes from audits of the delegated audit body and with the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance, at the same time, the coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the OPPS CR–POL was examined.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and drawing up of control plans at the place of implementation of projects were examined and evaluations of project applications carried out by independent evaluators were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The audit system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot audits, which allowed approval of e.g. deliveries of goods and co-financed services, eligibility of expenses submitted for reimbursement, and compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant deficiencies were found by the SAO audit in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on the provided subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, a risk of non-transparency of this process was found.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other deficiencies were found in the area of setting of monitoring indicators and in the setting of the irregularity reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Irregularities found by the NIK, which related to the functioning of the control and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules, were not evaluated as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the whole OPPS CR–POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit did not show a discrepancy between indicators and objectives set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all audited projects, the expected results were achieved, the funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are in line with the results of the survey of the social evaluation of project implementation described below.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect that the SAO and the SAI paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the fulfilment of the expected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time to the objectives of the entire Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, a public opinion survey was carried out in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected in the joint audit sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Training in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the survey was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both among the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and among the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey mainly concerned the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of projects including the implemented investments.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents for individual projects is given in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall social rating of the projects was good and reached 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both in terms of the objectives and other parameters mentioned in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of the investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and resumption of contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of fulfilment of the objectives/parameters (the actual level of impact) and the level expected by respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference relates to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The survey results were in line with the opinions of participants of panel discussions (target groups) carried out as part of the NIK audit on the Polish side, who pointed out the need for the implementation of the projects and confirmed their positive acceptance by the public and the fulfilment of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">The beneficiaries were checked for compliance of the material and time implementation of the project with the timetable and content of the project application, fulfilment of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in the projects, treatment of potential project revenues, fulfilment of the obligation to keep separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the prohibition of financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, fulfilment of the obligatory publicity concerning, in particular, the dissemination of awareness of the sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of eligibility of project expenses, selection of contractors and verification of the delivered fulfilment on the basis of the awarded public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the deficiencies classified by the SAO and NIK as ineligible expenditure from EU funds was found to be 85,094 €.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the stated level of materiality related to the total audited volume of funds for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the detected irregularities, the SAO and the SAI evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the commitments resulting from the conditions of support were duly fulfilled by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds intended for the implementation of audited projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nevertheless, seven out of eight beneficiaries audited by the SAI were found to have irregularities in the implementation of material and financial commitments.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and related to particularly inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, which did not have an impact on the selection of the contractor or the delivery of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of all projects audited by NIK, the irregularity found, which related to the non-fulfilment of reporting obligations, can be classified as ineligible expenditure, amounting to 43 003 PLN (of which 8 231 € financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure amounting to 2 098 053 CZK (of which 76 863 € financed by the ERDF) in three of the 19 projects audited.</seg>
<seg id="84">Irregularities included the non-delivery of paid materials and works or expenditure for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who had no connection to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system, in particular with regard to the consistent establishment of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, it is also necessary to strive for the establishment of such indicators at the programme and project level, which will allow more reliable verification of the fulfilment of the determined impacts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Comments and recommendations resulting from inspections carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate audit conclusions of the SAO and the SAI on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNICATIONS</seg>
<seg id="90">The report was prepared in Czech, English and Polish languages and signed by the presidents of the supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public works procurement and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel audits carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is to use public resources in the most efficient and economical way and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor for the success of the single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">The EU has set limits in its regulations above which the contracting authority must comply with certain requirements designed to guarantee a wide and unlimited competitive environment throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts below the EU thresholds, the regulation of their awarding remains the responsibility of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, public procurement is prone to corruption with a consequent high potential for damage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting authorities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair favouritism (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to perform parallel audits in the area of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The audits also included awarding contracts below the European thresholds in order to sanction the area of prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report, which is among others addressed to international organizations such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Audit areas and audited institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The evaluation of the BRH is based on general audits of the aforementioned areas, which were carried out at the German building administrations responsible for federal transport and land constructions between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, motorway constructions and large-scale construction projects were evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The BRH also included findings from past audits in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The evaluation of the SAO is based on audits carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other constructions in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, federal public procurement is mostly carried out by the regional building administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the area of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of state institutions for road and railway construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the area of building construction, public procurement is carried out by entities that receive budgetary funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used in the individual stages of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation must take into account differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the course of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and sub-statutory standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts .</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details regarding the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called procurement manuals of the federal government, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation that relates to contracts with a value above and below European thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Procurement law underwent substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules reinforced the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up space for more competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the course of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and restricted procedures in particular must be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the European threshold are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, restricted call for competition, negotiated procedures), however, these are practically identical to the above-mentioned conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and in calls for competition, any candidate can submit a bid.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved mainly by dividing the total public contract into business-specific parts and by dividing it into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">By awarding contracts divided into these parts, the chances of participating in the procedure are given to the largest possible number of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must be applied also in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception is the simplified below-threshold procedure, where the contracting authority may use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">Current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between an open procedure and a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are 85,000 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of contracting authorities' public works contracts and proportion of individual procedures in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">CZK 1,138 billion (15 %) of which was accounted for by the share of public contracts which, in addition to those awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of federal road and land constructions (without the construction of railways and water constructions) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal works and transport contracts was as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public calls; 12,7 % restricted management and calls;</seg>
<seg id="55">6.6% negotiated procedures and direct award of contracts; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118.6 billion CZK in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009, the value reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of tender types in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14,3 % restricted procedures; 9.5% negotiated procedures; 8.4% simplified procedures for low-threshold contracts; 2.7% other proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="59">The figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">The figures show that: parallel controls in both countries were focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption, which must be kept in mind during procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open significance. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and BRH carried out parallel controls on the procurement of European works contracts with an emphasis on prevention of corruption in their respective countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The audits were focused on comparing the legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public contracts in the field of land and transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">The following are the key findings:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national laws of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Prevention of corruption is not only the aim of the EU Directive, but also the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ partly in terms of focus and details.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the basic requirement to be met by the procurement documents is the inclusion of all information needed for the preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specifications must be neutral and must not contain any requirements restricting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The procurement documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic, the problem is an insufficient definition of the subject matter of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, the division of contracts into parts where possible is required in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The SAO's audits showed that in the Czech Republic very large public works in the field of road construction are awarded without being divided into parts or only into very significant parts in volume. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and risk of unserious price negotiations and inadmissible agreements.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to award additional works retrospectively if the need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">In both countries, the requirements for correctly determining the type of procurement procedure are met.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, under the applicable rules, contracting authorities are free to determine one of the open procurement procedures, namely the open procedure or the restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">The German rules in procurement and budget law enshrine the preference for open procedures for both European tenders and national tenders, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">The open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit a tender and also reduce the risk of corruption as they make it more difficult to negotiate prices illegally between candidates.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best value for money results are achieved.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts where the estimated total price reaches or exceeds the EU thresholds, the audited contracting entities have always issued a European tender.</seg>
<seg id="82">The correct estimation of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role in determining the type of tender.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used for objective pricing of public works, in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a public works contract under European tendering procedures, it is necessary to publish prior information and a contract notice in order to strengthen competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction audited impad with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">When selecting candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">Selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">Beyond the EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should rotate as often as possible candidates invited to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to prevent risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not follow these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting entities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates who wish to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between these candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid restricting competition in the form of illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the relevant measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited German contracting entities did not comply with this requirement in several cases (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements on the marking, documentation, protection and confidentiality of tenders are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and in Germany they are particularly detailed.</seg>
<seg id="102">Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The evaluation and evaluation of tenders is regulated procedurally in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but they were not always respected by the audited contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting authorities passed their tenders to third parties for consultation without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">Thus, tenders were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (point 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">For reasons of legal protection, bidders must be informed about the intended award of the contract before the contract is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection award is designed to prevent corruptive procedures before the contract is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of the contracts for national contractors.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the due review of the enterprises was not ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The tender documentation was not always complete or fully credible for the audited contracting authorities in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always adequately respected in the tender minutes.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some deficiencies identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (the Remedies Directive), both of which were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The EU's general procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">EU procurement principles include In addition, the Directive on the coordination of public procurement procedures includes provisions concerning construction projects with a total estimated value of €5 million or more.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the content of the procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the conclusion of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for the receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that tenderers may be required to meet; the criteria for selecting the most suitable tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Remedies Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In case of potential breaches of procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed according to the review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">There is no legal definition of what corruption actually means in either country.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is instigated by those who gain from it.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">Overall corruption-related damage is estimated at 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">When a contracting authority is involved in a contract, conventions restricting competition or allowing dishonest behaviour can weaken confidence in the integrity, capacity and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, preventing corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practices and procedures need to be checked in particular in areas particularly susceptible to corruption so that adequate measures can be taken to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective checks can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be a particularly susceptible area to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which particularly concerns active and passive bribery, the receipt and offering of significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German federal government has issued a manual of recommendations concerning the prevention of corruption in the federal administration, according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process, outside risk analysis: the preference for open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; the separation of the planning, procurement and accounting phases; the accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the competent federal ministry of information technology introduced a system for monitoring the award of federal road construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="142">Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total value of the contract and involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed to identify potential irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, including the employment or civil law dimension.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement of transparency, equal treatment and the prohibition of any discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were set by the government in the "Government's Anti-Corruption Strategy 2011-2012", which was updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of these measures were incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the thresholds for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notification by the contracting authority including the justification for the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts including annexes; the obligation to publish the actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of checks relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Tender documents must contain all the information needed to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the documents must make it possible to prepare the tender price.</seg>
<seg id="152">To make this possible, tenderers must not be exposed to risks that they could not have anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="153">Tender documents contain mainly specifications, as well as requirements to prove the qualifications of tenderers and criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must limit competition as little as possible and all candidates must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">The specifications must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific products are permissible in the procurement documents on a very limited scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of prevention of corruption is that the procurement documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, the documentation should avoid ambiguities or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that the specifications should be given in general terms without reference to a specific product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">The specifications must precisely define the supplies and services required and detail the number of units of work and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be given by units of work or supplies (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">It is permissible to define the required works in terms of their functionality only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that specifications must be drawn up completely and unambiguously.</seg>
<seg id="169">They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies whose necessity is not entirely obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payment in the form of lump sums or time worked must be avoided wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documents must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must allow each tenderer to prepare his tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender must be published only when the procurement documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">A contracting authority may divide a public contract into several separate lots if the nature of the subject of such a contract allows it.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, the application of the rule of dividing works into lots is required, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific aspects (specialised parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This allows participation in the competition by small and medium-sized entities, increases the number of potential bidders and makes it more difficult to fix prices.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is usually considered the most suitable in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, the tender dossier must contain the evaluation criteria in both national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the tenderer comprehensively and exhaustively about the criteria by which his tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to include the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European calls for tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national tendering procedures, it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require any information that would help to identify specific interested firms, architects or designers to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent experts without the knowledge of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents relating to tenders and to make them accessible for verification.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only point of contact for construction firms.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic currently does not have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional works or modification of existing works after the conclusion of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries allows for the award of a contract for additional works up to a certain limit to the same contractor without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, additional works must be necessary and have the character of a special part of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the award of additional works.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may entail the risk of a greater time lag in the execution of the contract and the possible inclusion of a new entity in an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">If the contract for additional works is awarded to the contractor of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents contractors from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or additional works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to additional works, there may also be less work during construction, i.e. works that were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic, less work and additional works cannot be compensated for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In rare cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, specifications included data requesting a particular brand name, e.g. for the resistance system of public signage, to prevent water infiltration or for anti-noise cladding, although this was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantity specifications broken down into lots</seg>
<seg id="206">In not a single case did the BRH record a check of procurement procedures of non-compliance with the general requirements for a call for tender for supplies and services under the quantity specifications broken down into lots.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases audited, tender documents were entirely drawn up before the call for tender was announced.</seg>
<seg id="209">In various cases, however, the documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in lots or in the timetable had to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="210">In rare cases, tender documents contained works and supplies for which the need was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender document for demolition works contained almost exclusively such lots.</seg>
<seg id="212">Division of the contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for not dividing the supplies into lots was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">The BRH did not find any shortcomings in the criteria for evaluation of tenders before the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of the names of authorised independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many documents mentioned interested authorised experts.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names were given on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact an explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the case of building projects, these cases were found mainly in the tender documents, where the elaboration of the specifications was entrusted to self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities stated that they did not have sufficient staff capacity for detailed examination of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="221">SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 flats, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products nor did it justify why it required the delivery of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">In the case of the construction of facilities of a university, the tender documents included references to specific commercial firms and specific product names.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overview of specifications and partial specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documentation the quantity and type of works, supplies or services required in the statement of acreage and defined for each building only the enclosed space in cubic meters as the unit of measurement.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of a road ring, the tender documentation for the restricted procedure was changed four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in the project documentation caused by the extension of the scope of the contract and the change of technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the construction of social buildings, the tender documentation had defects that forced the creation of additional works (lack of precise focus, lack of sufficient technical survey, lack of drawings).</seg>
<seg id="232">In the tender documentation for the construction of a large library, the interior elements were mentioned only in descriptive terms, without specifying quality requirements for products.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of the interior equipment of the building was ensured by subcontractors who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to award the contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">The analysis of three large road constructions during the construction of a road ring showed that it was possible to achieve savings of up to CZK 790 million from the achieved public contract price of CZK 15,508 million by awarding them in the open procedure in parts (separately after selected objects).</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, when awarding six building objects as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 62.5 million could be achieved, i.e.</seg>
<seg id="238">25% of the contracted price and when awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 287.8 million, i.e. also 25%, could be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the tender documentation, the contracting authority defined qualification criteria in the construction of roads, which limited the participation of small suppliers in the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the tender conditions of the open tender for a supplier for one construction of a motorway, the contracting authority required, among other things, the practice of the supplier consisting in the realization of at least three road constructions with a financial volume of each more than CZK 700 million, completed or put into operation during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of constructions above CZK 700 million in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of another construction of a motorway in the open procedure included six separate constructions, for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of construction works in the last three years of CZK 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of CZK 13.2 billion, there were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that the limitation of market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Area of additional works</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of additional works and did not award any of the procedures stipulated in the Act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of the non-approved additional works in one case amounted to CZK 1,591.4 million excluding VAT (increase by 21%) and in the other case to CZK 4,135.8 million excluding VAT (increase by 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The reason for the additional works was mainly ambiguous definition of the amount and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of the construction of university facilities, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documentation some works and supplies whose necessity for the completion and approval of the construction was already known at the time of the contract award.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and supplies, the contracting authority concluded amendments to the contract with the contractor of the construction with an increase in the price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">Unit prices of additional works set without a tender were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same contractor.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">On a selected sample of buildings, the SAO found that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic were CZK 355.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average costs in Germany for a kilometre section of a four-lane motorway are CZK 260.0 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison indicates that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions relating to the tender documentation are almost identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow candidates to calculate their costs and prepare their bids.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to award additional works.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on procurement documents are supplemented by other rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for limiting competition and for carrying out manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">Specification requirements are mostly met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases, shortcomings have been identified which could lead to a reduction of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The current rule in Germany requiring large construction projects to be divided into parts seems to be suitable for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without awarding them in parts or dividing them into large-scale projects may limit the pool of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">As a result of the strict requirement for bidder references applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of bidders for road construction works, public contracts are awarded to a small number of bidders and small and medium-sized companies have no chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">The limited number of bidders also increases the risk of fixing prices and other illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="272">As regards awarding additional contracts for extra works or modified works and their reimbursement, regulatory approaches are different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, the extra works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="277">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing works into lots, restricting competition and consequent adverse consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting entity defines the range of potential suppliers that will be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting entity can leave the range of potential suppliers unlimited, or it can limit the range according to the given criteria.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of large project works whose value reaches or exceeds the EU limits, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">In choosing the type of procedure, the contracting entity must comply in particular with the requirements of European law concerning the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total cost of the contract for the requested works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million), an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permissible.</seg>
<seg id="288">If the construction project reaches the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate from the European procurement procedure to a limited extent by issuing a national procurement procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below the threshold of €1.0 million ($25 million) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimated total contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or intentionally estimating its cost too low with the intention of avoiding the fundamental obligation to issue a European procurement procedure is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">Choosing the type of procedure is very important for preventing corruption, as restricting competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law, is an important part of the procurement procedure documentation.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures also for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of procedures are allowed only if the statutory conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike the Czech legislation, the relevant German regulation of budget law and principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public call for participation in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of procedures, including restricted procedures, are allowed only exceptionally, if the legislation allows it.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions must be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference for open procedures is intended to guarantee that restricting competition to the maximum extent possible and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimation of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the costs of building projects, contracting authorities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed building projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for building types, building units, building components and partial works.</seg>
<seg id="306">On the basis of such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road works.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, it is expected that the database will be expanded at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects for determining the expected costs of building contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimation of the entity financing the project or based on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Measures for standardisation are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">Under the Anti-Corruption Programme 2011-2012, the relevant ministries are to develop a database of the usual prices of standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The use of the price system to determine the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering to specify in detail the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="314">The price system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly works, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to establish unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued normative prices for transport works for their control, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of preparation of the works.</seg>
<seg id="317">BRH's main control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting entities generally awarded contracts by open procedure or by means of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of the budget and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the road building sector, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public tendering was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the case of the blanket control, BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16,000 procedures, that the restricted procedure has a clear disadvantage compared to the public procedure and the public call, and the restricted procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, the tender prices in the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure were between 6% and 10% higher than in the public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Audit Court confirmed differences in value for money obtained in the public and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The study by the Ministry of Construction even found that the prices in the restricted procedures were twice as high as those in the public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated at more than €5 million ($125 million), the audited contracting authorities generally prepared procurement plans indicating which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of works awarded under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total works.</seg>
<seg id="331">No case of circumvention of the European procedure requirement was recorded in the form of an excessively low cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases the minimum share for the European-wide procedure was not reached due to a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the execution of the works, some contracting authorities illegally changed the procurement allocation plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not show that the minimum share of the European procedure was subsequently respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of European procedures according to the project accounts was usually lower than the share set in the tender plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected values of the construction projects' contracts exceeded the European limits, the contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-parts with a value exceeding €1 million ($25 million).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the respective contracts on the basis of the national procedure without giving any valid reasons for the need to deviate from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of the tender procedure type</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, equipment for a major sporting event and construction of apartments), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, even though these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The division reduced the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding mode or even outside the statutory regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods of calculating the expected price</seg>
<seg id="343">Price norms applicable to road construction projects were not yet an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices indicated in the completed procedures, which were, however, burdened by inefficiencies and excessive profit of the suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were approximately 37 % lower than these price norms.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the norms in relation not only to the prices from the past, but also in relation to other comparable markets and price development.</seg>
<seg id="347">For ground constructions, the estimated price was based on the project budget carried out by architects or on an investor's estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price differed significantly from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The estimated price of the construction of a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but during the implementation it increased by CZK 54 million, i.e. by 27 %.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, in the case of the construction of a depository of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the anticipated price and increased even more during the implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">For the construction of a large library, it was CZK 400 million, i.e. by 22%. For the construction of a palace of justice, the actual price increased disproportionately (by 139%) during the implementation of the construction, compared to the increase in functional areas (only by 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of the type of procurement procedure and on compliance with European limits in their national legislation, so that the respective national regulations of both countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public procedures in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public call for participation gives the possibility for more competitors to participate in a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids, which guarantee the best value for money effect.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is significantly reinforced as the pool of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixing of prices between bidders.</seg>
<seg id="359">Studies have confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference of open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in open or narrower procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition for contracting authorities to limit the number of bidders in narrower procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">The narrower procedure has now come very close to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, contracting authorities are largely fulfilling the requirement of preference for open procedures or public calls for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of some projects implemented in Germany, European limits have not been respected, resulting in a lack of a minimum share in pan-European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, a satisfactory system has not yet been put in place to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive controls, that the requirements to choose the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are fulfilled, or they should create such conditions as are necessary to enable the correct calculation of the expected costs.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>
<seg id="368">In cases where contracts are awarded in the framework of the European procedure, the contracting entity must publish a tender report.</seg>
<seg id="369">Preliminary information and contract notice are an important basis for European competition.</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="371">By means of prior notices, the contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the intended projects.</seg>
<seg id="372">Preliminary notices are required for projects where the estimated total cost is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for submitting tenders in individual procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority is obliged to publish a contract award notice with detailed information for all public contracts requiring the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="374">The information is binding on the contracting authority after publication.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other things, the notice must contain the specifications, the time limits for the procedure and for completion of the contract, the specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.</seg>
<seg id="376">A common procurement dictionary must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="378">In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notices at national level should not contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the notice is sent to the Publications Office of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in a pre-notification may distort competition or even facilitate manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on pre-information and contract award notices in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, pre-information and notices must be published even in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">The procurement procedure may not start until one month after the pre-notification has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of the pre-information may be waived only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, pre-information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not required.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national procedures, the public call must be published on the federal government website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted procedures without competition from participants, the notice must be published when the estimated contract price is equal to or higher than €25,000 ($625,000).</seg>
<seg id="390">The prior information notices must explain all the planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">The splitting of projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered to be less important.</seg>
<seg id="393">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary notice</seg>
<seg id="396">Contracting authorities published a prior information notice for projects which included works to be awarded in the European procedure.</seg>
<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they shortened the time limit, although the number of days between the prior information notice being sent and the contract notice being sent was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In other abridged procedures, the annual time limits applicable to the prior information had expired and were to be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the advance notice did not indicate the anticipated division of the works into several parts.</seg>
<seg id="400">Procurement notice</seg>
<seg id="401">Some notices contained codes from the common dictionary that deviated from the content of the advance notice or did not specify precisely the works to be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="402">In rare cases, the notice at national level included more information, e.g. concerning performance deadlines, or was published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">One contracting authority hired an external company to publish the national notice.</seg>
<seg id="405">The company published the notice on its platform, the use of which was subject to a fee.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authority did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to send further notices to a free internet government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">On a sample, it was found that only one third of the notices were actually published on the government portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">SAO</seg>
<seg id="409">Procurement notice</seg>
<seg id="410">In the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set criteria in the notice of the tender procedure for the construction contractor, according to which it would reduce the large number of bids for the evaluation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority was not able to demonstrate the method of selection (reduction) of the bids for the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="412">The reduction of the number of bids was allowed by previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the construction of the road circuit, the contracting authority did not define in the notice of the tender procedure or in the qualification documentation the values by which it would assess the degree of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of bidders to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority evaluated the fulfilment of the qualification so that all six candidates in the tender procedure fulfilled it, but excluded one of them as having fulfilled it only in the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent as it did not publish in advance information on what of the qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of invitations</seg>
<seg id="417">For building modifications in former military installations, the contracting authority did not publish a written call for tenders in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / Summary</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information process with prior information and publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements for transparency and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish prior information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany for restricted procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Compared to open procedures, restricted procurement procedures do not allow participation of all potential bidders who would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the contracting authority first selects potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow to limit the number of bidders in European restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, the restricted procedure requires at least five bidders to be invited to submit a tender, and in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential bidders must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently broad to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential bidders who will be invited is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few bidders can facilitate their collusion.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control in order to make the procedure transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for the selection of bidders are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting authorities should rotate the tenderers they invite to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permissible to restrict competition from a regional point of view.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting authorities must document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three tenderers are required to be invited in the case of a restricted procedure and several suitable tenderers in the case of a negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except in two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of tenderers approached in the case of a restricted and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, the "four eyes principle" must be respected in the selection of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes their list, another must substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by removing the proposed tenderer or appointing another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to avoid a situation where an individual can definitively determine the range of tenderers who will take part in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">If such a provision is not in place, a far-reaching illegal agreement between the participants is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender must be confidential and must not be divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">Authorised independent experts are also obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="448">There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor is there any measure for confidential treatment of the list of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German provisions, external companies may not designate candidates, but they may make proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">Except in a few cases, the requirement for reaching the minimum number of tenderers was met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7,000 works contracts with a value below the national limit showed that in the case of restricted procedures, contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential tenderers and in the case of direct negotiation an average of 4.4 tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of contractors and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular in the field of building construction, contracting authorities did not change the pool of tenderers approached, as they had good experience with those with whom they had previously cooperated.</seg>
<seg id="458">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that in the case of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee that they would reach out to candidates whose suitability they had already ascertained beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the range of candidates in the non-public procedure included a greater proportion of regional tenderers than in the case of public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-checking principle and proposals of self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">The contracting authorities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">They mainly argued the lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who had proposed the candidate who had been asked to participate in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="466">A check of some samples showed that the list of potential tenderers had been drawn up by self-employed professionals and had been accepted by the contracting authority without changes.</seg>
<seg id="467">The contracting authorities were thus insufficiently protected from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of the treatment of lists of potential tenderers</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for invitation to tender in a database to which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed for manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of prospective or admitted tenderers, who could then agree on the price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The documentation gave the reasons for the selection of tenderers in only a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Criteria for the selection of tenderers</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the ring road, the candidates did not have information about what information about their qualifications would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For the action related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the tender notice for participation in the restricted procedure did not set out criteria for limiting the number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority had limited participation in the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then carried out the selection of candidates by random selection – by drawing lots, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion already in the tender notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning tenderer in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent unlawful restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by means of so-called cross-checking (the four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of tenderers and by prohibiting external companies from making proposals for the selection of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with a view to manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit found that some of the above rules were not applied to a sufficient degree and that an unlawful restriction of the number of candidates was not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting authorities are obliged to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings completely.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The stage of the procurement procedure, at which potential tenderers can prepare tenders on the basis of the tender documents they have received, starts with the publication of the tender information and/or the invitation to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the date of opening the envelopes, potential tenderers can submit their tenders to the contracting entity in order to compete for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting entity must follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">These rules relate in particular to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers prepare their tenders must always be sent by the contracting entity.</seg>
<seg id="496">The design offices that are involved in the procedure should not fulfil this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of ambiguity in the tender documents or when other questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply the information to the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">No information may be provided by the design bureaux in charge of drawing up the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="500">During this entire stage, any contact between the design bureau and the tenderers must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing them to be contacted may adversely affect competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Tenders submitted electronically must be encrypted.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured external service suppliers with the printing and distribution of the documents, and their employees must be bound to confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in their original state (sealed) to the official in charge of their safekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="507">This official must have no interest in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">Tenders received must be locked until the opening date of the envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, tenders received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority issues a report with details of the competition, including the tender number and information on the preparation of the tender and its receipt.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no specific provisions on the safekeeping of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="512">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">BRH inspected the award of the administrative building.</seg>
<seg id="515">Sending the procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The inspected contracting authorities sent the procurement documents either directly or entrusted its printing and distribution to an external firm.</seg>
<seg id="517">Self-employed persons did not send any documentation.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information to tenderers</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the tender documents related to questioning and obtaining information, the contracting authority did not follow the rule for separate planning from the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, it often did not mention in the documentation the names of its contact staff, but rather the staff of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some notices during the tender procedure even included the names of companies or self-employed persons who participated in the preparation of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, tenderers who asked questions during the tender procedure did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Labelling of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">For the contracting authorities, all accepted tenders were marked with a stamp and a receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases for the negotiated procedure, tenders were accepted by self-employed professionals, which violated the rule of one building preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in an open slot in the mail room, to which all employees had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another contracting authority placed the box in the corridor without constant supervision, and a part of the tenders thrown into the box remained there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, and it was accessible not only to employees.</seg>
<seg id="531">SAO</seg>
<seg id="532">The SAO did not find any shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, especially between interested companies and design offices cooperating in the procurement procedure, throughout the entire process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are suitable for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more elaborated than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">In Germany, accumulated control records have shown breaches of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These irregularities can easily be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the opening of envelopes, tenders that have so far been closed are opened, their contents read and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period during which a tenderer is bound by his tender begins when the deadline for submitting or opening envelopes expires and ends with a deadline specified by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="545">European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements to protect tenders as well as competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="547">The principles of "more eyes", transparency and trustworthiness of the process of opening envelopes are intended to prevent manipulation and modification of tenders already submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">Opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">Compliance with the principle of ‘multiple eyes’ is intended to prevent individuals from covertly manipulating bids.</seg>
<seg id="552">Bidders may be present when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="553">When opening, all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the board and are opened one by one.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bids received late must not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">To ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this stage, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record must include, among other things, the names of the bidders and the price offered.</seg>
<seg id="556">The record must be read and signed by the group leader.</seg>
<seg id="557">The record may also be signed by the bidders present.</seg>
<seg id="558">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a board is set up for opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent experts is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">Members of the board may also be entrusted with deliberations during the subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. the evaluation of the bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the manager and the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="563">The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of building, the registrar may not participate in the preparatory stage (preparation of the tender documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and may not be a member of the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">The German regulations require that the minutes of the opening of envelopes contain not only the tender prices, but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) signs, e.g. damaged envelopes on receipt or late receipt of a tender.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, the minutes drawn up must include, in addition to the tender prices, an indication of the tenderer's language and signature authorization.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German regulations require all parts of the opening envelopes to be marked so as to prevent subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, usually marked by a form of perforation with a date, must be kept confidential (secret) after the opening of the envelopes has been completed and may only be made available to persons who further process them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no similar arrangements in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope may not be opened and the tenderer must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="571">In Germany, they do not have this arrangement and if a single tender is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Cross-checking principle</seg>
<seg id="575">During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities followed the four-eyes principle.</seg>
<seg id="576">The manager and the registrar, who was not assigned a different role, were always present.</seg>
<seg id="577">In rare cases, however, for small negotiated procedures, natural persons opened the tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Opening process</seg>
<seg id="579">The notes from the opening of the envelopes did not always document the progress.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, tenders submitted late were not marked and in some cases signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Marking of received tenders</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities marked the tenders with a date-stamped perforation, which was in line with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Some of them had wrongly marked the tenders in the past, but changed their practice after being warned by the BRH.</seg>

<seg id="586">Deadline for the delivery of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">During road repairs, for one action, the tenderer's tender was submitted to the contracting authority with a month's delay, which nevertheless accepted it.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">The essential parts of the provisions for opening envelopes are identical in both countries with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, thus allowing for a substantial reduction of the risk of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">Marking, safe keeping and respecting the confidential nature of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes in submitted tenders.</seg>
<seg id="592">Moreover, the staff responsible for opening envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the deadline set.</seg>
<seg id="596">At the same time, it must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating tenders in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to check the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must be in a good economic and financial position and possess the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Bidders who have ever been finally convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">The tenders of non-excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the economically most favourable tender and, in particular, examine all significantly low price tenders.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation are particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be excluded without legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be left to tender.</seg>
<seg id="606">The outcome of the evaluation may be improperly influenced by the preference of a tenderer or its disadvantage, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special measures in selecting the persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of integrity and technical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="608">It must also ensure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the examination and evaluation of tenders in successive stages.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for the proof of the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weightings set out in the notice or in the procurement documents may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria set for evaluating the suitability of tenderers may no longer be used.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation may be carried out only on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view, whether they are complete or do not contain any suspicious elements which might encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of the tenders results in the discovery of an unreasonably low tender price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before his tender may be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, tenderers must maintain confidentiality and only authorised persons may participate in the evaluation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may examine the mathematical accuracy of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not involved in the decision-making stage of the selection of the contractor or in the implementation of the project may be entrusted with evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions as to who may carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with the review and evaluation of tenders, they must be aware that the tenders are confidential and respect this honestly.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals for decisions to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be examined and evaluated by a committee appointed by the contracting authority, which draws up a report with a proposal for conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If in Germany the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the tenderer fails to provide evidence, he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, not only the total price but also the unit prices must be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the tender indicates that prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated to be unreasonably high or low, tenderers must be asked to provide explanations.</seg>
<seg id="635">If they fail to provide explanations, and if the contracting authority can demonstrate that the tender contains countervailing prices, such tenders must be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent tenderers from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to individual parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the total price of a work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Valuation compensations do not justify the exclusion of a tender.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a price that is unreasonably high or low.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more tenders differ in price by 10 % or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from other tenders, tenderers must prove that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only bids with disproportionately low prices have been received and the bidders have not justified these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the bid is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this does not constitute a reason for refusing to award the contract to the bidder concerned (unlike German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">In Germany, if there is a suspicion of behaviour intended to restrict competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this immediately to the competent superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter must decide on the way forward and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">Furthermore, it must approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded in the negotiation of the contract or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Examination of suitability and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some recommendations made by potential contractors, made by self-employed persons, the contracting authorities did not themselves check the suitability of the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="653">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some procurement procedures, insufficient documentation was provided as to whether, in making the choice, the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested persons and confidentiality of tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be performed exclusively by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contracting authorities tried to justify this by their insufficient human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to examine the tenders for the services of persons who were not formally bound to preserve the confidentiality of the tenders and to perform with due diligence their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As for contracting entities, there was generally no conclusive record of whether tenders in the safekeeping of self-employed professionals were only available to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Examination and mathematical control of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities passed open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed examination of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention of manipulation, third parties could make changes to tenders that could not be identified by the contracting entity.</seg>
<seg id="664">Examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in tenders were not adequately identified or where data on prices and products were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A sample check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement procedures the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the pre-estimated costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One in twenty procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of tenders or on negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there was also a lack of detailed information on, for example, unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as reasons for deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">Contracting authorities argued that identifying and demonstrating balancing prices was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting authorities, a price 66% lower than the original cost estimate was offered.</seg>
<seg id="673">No details were recorded on the closer examination of cost or on the reasons for deviations.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping in the bidder to whom the contract might have been awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the original cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority rated this bidder as a "low-cost company" which was unable to meet either the quality requirements or the deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a bidder whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the procurement procedure and argued that the said bidder could be assumed not to have based its pricing on unreasonably high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting authority and these were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two bidders submitted bids containing identical price calculations, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both bids.</seg>
<seg id="682">The audits did not show any significant deficiencies in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Assessment of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">In many construction projects, such as university buildings, roads and railways, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from participation in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority specified in the tender specifications, or did not substantiate the qualification to the required extent, or, on the contrary, one contracting authority failed to substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of the bidder who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">In the case of the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, individual evaluation criteria of the procurement procedure for the construction contractor were established, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">In the case of the railway infrastructure development project, the weightings of the evaluation criteria were not determined at the time of the contract award, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In the case of the infrastructure repair project, the evaluation of the criterion “shortening the construction time” was not carried out correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For the bidders in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a greater shortening of construction time than indicated in their bids.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the bidder</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate the criteria on which it had assessed the bids received and how it had selected the most suitable one.</seg>
<seg id="693">The correctness of the selection of small-scale contractors associated with the construction of a road ring with an estimated price of up to CZK 500,000.</seg>
<seg id="694">It was not possible to verify the correctness of the selection of the contractors, as the contractors were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on price and timing of performance, but evidence of these negotiations was not produced.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of bids correspond to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the selection of individuals involved in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike in the Czech Republic, in Germany, these steps of the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, in particular as regards the application of the cross-principle and the protection of bids.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for the verification of the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, in some cases checks found that the substantive steps of the process in the verification and evaluation of tenders were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The absence of control tools and transparency in the decision-making during the examination and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">Checks showed serious deficiencies, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior due diligence and the documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">If contracting authorities entrust a third party with the performance of functions related to the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against the increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">When checking the validity of prices, the German contracting authorities audited did not in all cases use the full set of tools available and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, deficiencies were found in the evaluation of the appropriateness of tenders and the application of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">After the examination and evaluation of the tenders, the procurement process is concluded by the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of the European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision to award the contract.</seg>
<seg id="710">Contractors have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its review if appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="712">The period of 10 days applies to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this period or before the decision of the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by swiftly implementing the decision of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority must document the progress of the procedure appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented the procedure on information obligations.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, the latter cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly performed screening and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within a specified period.</seg>
<seg id="723">This is because the tenderer is not bound by its bid after this period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="724">The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">Unsuccessful tenderers are to be informed of the result in a timely manner, stating the reason why their bid was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">Cancellation of the procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not correspond to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period prior to the conclusion of the contract of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before the decision on its EU provision and the review award is taken.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or if only one tender meets the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender fulfils the conditions set out in the tender documentation and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main audit findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">The audits found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases of European procedures, companies receiving letters of authority before the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also in several cases of open procedures, letters of authority contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the deadlines for awarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous offer because a bidder offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfill the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">In one case, during the reconstruction and construction of a university, the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor in accordance with the contract proposal contained in the selected bidder's bid.</seg>
<seg id="742">In some projects for repairs and maintenance of roads, construction of a motorway and a road ring, contracts were concluded later than stipulated by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the case of construction modifications in former military districts, the contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable offer to all bidders after the legal deadline had expired.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries implemented EU regulations on the termination of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below the EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding the contract was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings when concluding procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process, with all its individual stages, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, must be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of procurement procedures at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">The data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document procurement procedures complies with the fundamental requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision-making and justification gives a guarantee of transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each bidder in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Adequate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to provide detailed reasons for individual decisions and their merits significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of the procedures to the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days from the date of the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and this also fulfils the requirement of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the essential data on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission issues annual statistics which provide an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The deadline for notification is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those which are mandatory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the limit of €25,000 ($625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 ($375,000) including VAT.</seg>
<seg id="771">Below this limit, only the participants in the procedure are informed.</seg>
<seg id="772">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of awards were not fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="776">The notice did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. reasons for the supply specifications and national rules.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain the mandatory elements.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of the award</seg>
<seg id="780">In some European procedures, the contracting authority made errors in the publication of the notice.</seg>
<seg id="781">In several awards, evidence of the publication of the notice was missing.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting obligation</seg>
<seg id="783">Statistically verified files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.</seg>
<seg id="784">Preliminary transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the contracting authority published information on the outcome of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one contracting authority, information on the contract was not published due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the contracting authority half a year to notice the error.</seg>
<seg id="788">As a result, the outcome of the procedure was not published during this time.</seg>
<seg id="789">SAO</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant shortcomings in the documentation of the procurement procedure were found, such as incorrect data on bid prices in the reports of the evaluation committee.</seg>
<seg id="792">In addition, some documents on the opening of envelopes were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of the award</seg>
<seg id="794">In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, construction of a motorway and a road ring, the notices of the award were sent after the deadline, or were not published.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summary</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.</seg>
<seg id="798">Czech notification obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.</seg>
<seg id="799">The audits revealed shortcomings significantly reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU with the aim of creating a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures aimed at preventing corruption are aimed not only at avoiding it or at reducing it, but also at preventing financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings of the two audit institutions – the SAO and BRH – with regard to the application of both countries' procurement law and a comparison of its respective provisions give an internal view on common and different elements that can help both countries in further development and application of this law.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries there is an important common base for public procurement and fulfilment of the basic requirements in the areas of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting authorities strengthen these requirements partly with very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has extended public procurement provisions requiring a European procedure to procedures below the EU limits and is therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">Nevertheless, the audits showed that contracting authorities are not always fully compliant with all the relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the aforementioned irregularities, taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the audits identified risks affecting economy and value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">These include, in particular, incomplete definition of the subject matter of the public contract, which resulted in additional works that were often awarded in violation of the law, insufficient definition of the anticipated price, and the required qualification conditions reducing the potential pool of bidders and thus reducing competition, especially in the area of transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="816">Preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">The joint audits were not aimed at detecting cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can check whether the competent authorities of both countries take measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">As regards the prevention of corruption, the two countries focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German provisions give room for wide and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element of the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech regulations aim mainly at enhancing the transparency of public procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, there are general principles for the prevention of corruption, which apply to the whole federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles were also included among the requirements for public procurement and were adopted in order to meet the specific needs of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, sometimes with great precision, the methods of compliance with the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and for the selection of persons included in it.</seg>
<seg id="827">In BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, tender documentation and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms for preventing corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions have to comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting authorities should provide their employees with further training to familiarise them with anti-corruption requirements and further raise their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the revealed weaknesses relate to activities delegated by the building administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the absence of adequate controls when delegating powers increases the risk of misuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore be transferred to third parties only if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorized interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">Anti-corruption strategies were adopted at government level in the Czech Republic, which also significantly affect the area of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">Audit actions of the SAO took place during the period when one of the most important parts of the strategy was implemented, namely a significant change of the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of subsequent implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The adopted strategy and new legal regulations can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">Under the new regulations, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the expected value of the public contract, the adequacy of the requirements for qualification, the determination of basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders, and document and publish everything properly.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion on the ways of implementing the EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their wide application in practice confirmed that the EU requirements on competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and supporting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damages arising from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both BRH and SAO insist that it is the obligation of contracting authorities to continue and improve measures against corruption and manipulation where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, organisational structures and processes of procurement procedures should be continuously monitored for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for corrective actions and to react appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="847">Compared to the practice in Germany, it has emerged that the Czech Republic should increase the share of open procurement procedures, which give space to competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="848">Procurement in parts, where permissible and suitable for contracting authorities, can also have a positive impact on the achieved price. A higher number of bidders puts pressure on the achieved price.</seg>
<seg id="849">The organisation of the procurement procedure also has an influence on the course of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is organised by special state organisations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contracting organisations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and the BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work, where appropriate, and to address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as the principles and findings mentioned are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for ensuring that public contracts are awarded in a regime of well-functioning and honest competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel audits of the administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint Final Report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The submitted joint report informs on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cooperation between supreme audit institutions of both countries was realized on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic in the performance of parallel audits focused on the administration of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of parallel audits was selected on the basis of the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to find out how it is applied at the national level, how the system of administration of excise duties is set up and in what way the systems in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic are different.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of the control actions carried out were the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last but not least, it was beneficial to find that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty administration is very limited without the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>

<seg id="18">on the results of parallel controls of the administration of the SPD in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration complies with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been found between the excise duty adjustment in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic; in the Czech Republic, it contributes to the effective administration of excise duties by verifying the economic stability of applicants for a permit and mandatory marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils and certain other oils; In Slovakia, the distribution of control stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome for tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against evasion of excise taxes, monitoring of movements of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, implementation of the fuel distributor institute and registration of sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol have proved good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Revenues from excise taxes in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic have been growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing eco-saving measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not been met in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic so far, among other reasons, because the indexation of excise tax rates is not implemented in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the importance of excise taxes on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden by excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The introduction of eco-measures has been financially supported by the state for a long time, but these measures have a negative impact on excise tax revenues, which will have to be replaced by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditures in the future.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditures spent on the administration of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been growing for a long time, mainly due to wage increases, and their efficiency has been decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency has also been negatively affected by expenditures on the computerisation of excise tax administration (IT expenditures) and by expenditures on wages of employees performing permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computerisation of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic has not significantly affected the reduction of the number of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend that the Ministry of the Slovak Republic reconsider the validity of the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditures was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period that would lead to a reduction in the personnel intensity of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax subjects is approximately one third lower in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical performance of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">Administration of excise taxes in the Slovak Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and due to the ratio of the number of tax operations to the number of subjects it is also more costly.</seg>
<seg id="35">The electronization of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">Administration of excise tax returns is fully electronized in the Slovak Republic, documents proving taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically transmitted in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronization support effective administration of excise taxes, and therefore the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic recommend applying them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditures for implementation of the EMCS system could not be compared, as the Slovak Ministry of Finance provided data on expenditures only for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011–2015, but expenditures were incurred even before this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenditures incurred in the period only for the upgrade of EMCS were in the Slovak Republic about 20% higher than expenses incurred in the Czech Republic both for the implementation of EMCS and for the upgrade of the system in more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">The administrators of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic did not reach comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the Slovak Republic the administration of excise taxes is significantly more resource intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of the electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise tax (EMCS) made the administration of excise taxes more efficient, but in the Slovak Republic to a lesser extent as significantly higher expenses were spent on the implementation of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">The cooperation of the two audit institutions took place on the basis of the Agreement on Cooperation in the execution of parallel audits focused on the administration of excise taxes dated 18 August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic agreed to perform parallel audits, which will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and whose results will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the findings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Joint audit questions were agreed on which the parallel audits were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of the subject and objectives of the parallel audits:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the parallel audits was to compare the performance of excise tax administrators taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and to identify weaknesses in the excise tax administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">The following main audit questions were to be answered in particular:</seg>
<seg id="50">Did the excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when incurring comparable expenses?</seg>
<seg id="51">Did the introduction of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) make the excise tax administration more effective and was the expenditure spent on its implementation effective?</seg>
<seg id="52">Parallel audits were carried out to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of legal regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.</seg>
<seg id="53">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="54">The General Directorate of Customs (DG) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (FR SR) joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries, the objectives of this declaration include the fight against fraud, the examination of the possibility of harmonizing legislation and searching for harmonised interpretations on the rules of selected problems, the examination of the possibility of joint activities to increase the efficiency in detecting fraud and the sharing of experience and best practices.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 The EMCS is operated according to the Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of the audit carried out by the SAO of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="57">Audit number: 15/33</seg>
<seg id="58">Audit subject: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="59">Audit objective: The objective of the SAO of the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties, in particular in the monitoring of transport under the system of conditional exemption from excise duties and in securing the tax (customs debts); to examine whether the system of administration of excise duties is set up in such a way as to ensure the efficiency of the collection of state budget revenues.</seg>
<seg id="60">Audit period: years 2012–2015 and in case of factual connections the period before and after</seg>

<seg id="63">Audit number: KA-023/2016/1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Audit subject: Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="65">Audit objective: The objective of the audit was to examine independently and objectively whether the General Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Authorities (CA) in the administration of excise duties operate economically, efficiently and effectively in accordance with generally binding legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="66">Audit period: years 2012–2015</seg>
<seg id="67">Audit person: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">Legislation on excise duties administration is divided into the level of EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/EC, concerning the general regulation of excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the administration of taxes and the treatment of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive allows for the imposition of consumption taxes on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">EU legislation regulates in particular the minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of selected products, the production, storage, processing and holding of products subject to tax, the incurrence of tax liability, exemption from tax and refund of tax, supervision of transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation allows for the establishment of control procedures and institutes at national level, provided that they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Excise tax legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, the legislation on excise taxes is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of the mineral oil tax, the alcohol tax, the tobacco products tax, the beer tax, the wine and intermediate products tax and the raw tobacco tax.</seg>
<seg id="77">This Act defines the forms of disposal of products subject to excise taxes, the taxpayer, the authorisation procedure, the conditions for transport of products, the tax declaration and penalties for infringements of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">The Act and subsequent decrees further regulate certain other conditions for handling mineral oils (marking of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, the monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and the storage of raw tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No 261/2007 Coll., on the Stabilisation of Public Budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are also contained in special legislation. Act No 311/2006 Coll. on Fuel and an implementing regulation regulate the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and keeping of records of fuel put into free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No 61/1997 Coll., on Alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No 307/2013 Coll., on obligatory marking of alcohol, and the relevant implementing regulations stipulate the obligatory marking of alcohol in consumer packaging, the conditions for the handling of control tapes and the conditions for the handling of alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, taking over, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">Tax procedures not specified in the special regulations are governed by Act No 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Penalties are imposed by procedures pursuant to Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Administrative Code.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for issuing a trade licence (concession) for the operation of the trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuel" and "production, treatment and sale of fermentation alcohol, potable alcohol and spirits" are governed by Act No 455/1991 Coll., on the trade business (Trade Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has used the authorisation to introduce control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to supervise compliance with legal regulations when handling selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as when handling selected products for which tax has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These include monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking of certain other mineral oils, marking of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic has used the authorisation to apply excise duty to other products as well and has introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise taxes in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">Based on the Government of the Czech Republic's resolution of 3 October 2012 no. 735, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market in spirits" resulted in major legislative changes in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015, which introduced a number of measures against tax fraud on excise duty on alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were also major changes in the legislation on mineral oil tax, tax on tobacco products and the criminality of preparation of tax reduction.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal law protection of tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1 July 2016, the preparation of the crime of "tax reduction, fee and similar obligatory payment" is criminalised. The implemented regulation should enable police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. the deployment of operatively searched means.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions of excise tax administration</seg>
<seg id="95">With effect from 1 January 2015, the issuance of a permit to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is subject to: reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; authorisation to operate a trade enabling the pursuit of the activity related to the permit; situations where the applicant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">The aim of the legislation was in particular to address the issue of the creation of tax arrears by reducing entities authorised to dispose of products subject to excise tax.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability newly allows the tax administration to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both in the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities without sufficient financial income to properly fulfil tax obligations from disposing of selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">To assess the economic stability of the applicant, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which the financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, the tax administrator's administrative discretion with regard to the individual conditions of the given procedure also depends.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law stipulates the periodicity of the verification of compliance with the condition of economic stability due to the timeliness of the data – the verification takes place once a year in connection with the deadline for filing the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax administrator has the possibility to determine other conditions needed for the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the permit holder does not fulfil the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the permit or cancel it with a delay.</seg>
<seg id="104">Out of the total number of 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of creating arrears in case the tax obligation exceeds the amount of the tax security (e.g. repeated recipient).</seg>
<seg id="105">The permit was revoked for 10 entities, other applicants increased the tax security, capitalized their contribution to the company or provided up-to-date accounting data according to which they already fulfilled all the conditions for issuing the permit.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the applicant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must also be fulfilled by a natural person who is a statutory body or a member thereof, or by a natural person who, although not a statutory body of the applicant or a member thereof, carries out this activity (chaining of legal persons in the capacity of a statutory body or its member, so-called connected entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 connected entities were examined.</seg>
<seg id="108">The records kept under the Excise Tax Act (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) contain data on:</seg>
<seg id="109">the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, received, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment regime (conditional exemption regime, import, retrospective entry into conditional exemption regime, export, free tax circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of the event and the entry in the register;</seg>
<seg id="111">the transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carrier, transport number);</seg>
<seg id="112">the registration numbers of the related documents;</seg>
<seg id="113">the notification of the release into free tax circulation of the alcohol in consumer packaging marked with a control tape and the data of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="114">The record of receipt after transport must be made immediately after its termination.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of registers kept electronically, the record must be kept or enable the output in the format xls, xlsx, ods.</seg>
<seg id="116">Ethyl alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures aimed at ensuring a detailed overview of the activities of entities (see Annex 3, Figure A) from the production of raw alcohol through the marking with a control tape to its distribution to the final seller or authorised user of the exempt alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, the production equipment for the production of alcohol which is not in operation is also subject to supervision by customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the handling of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are: The records of the production, receipt, stocks and delivery of alcohol contain information on the quantity of alcohol according to the various stages of the production and processing of alcohol with the identification numbers of documents.</seg>
<seg id="121">To limit the volume of consumer packaging, the material of packaging and to limit the number of packages with broken control tape at the point of final sale or delivery to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging with a capacity of max. one litre, or three litres if it is a container made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Spirits in larger packaging are regarded as unmarked, which are prohibited from being handled.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of final sale to a natural person for his or her personal consumption, there may be max. one consumer packaging with broken control tape, or three if they are fitted with a one-way valve.</seg>
<seg id="125">Mandatory registration of a person who places alcohol in products in consumer packaging having at least 15% vol. of alcohol into free tax circulation and is: an importer of alcohol, a producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or an operator of a tax warehouse under conditional tax exemption, provided that personal and technical conditions are fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="126">Personal conditions – reliability, integrity and non-pronouncement of disqualification – must be fulfilled by the applicant and a person in the capacity of a statutory body or a responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="127">The applicant must provide a security of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approximately €3,700 to €185,000) depending on the anticipated quantity of control tapes collected.</seg>
<seg id="128">Technical conditions for registration are an appropriate place for marking alcohol and equipping the place of marking or tax warehouse with a camera tracking device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="129">The control tape registration marks are introduced for marking spirits with a volume of more than 0.06 litre.</seg>
<seg id="130">When control tapes are transported, the control tape registration mark must be stated in the transport documents or customs declaration at export.</seg>
<seg id="131">The control tape until 30.11.2013 contained a ten-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration number, the code of the application for allocation of control tapes and the code of classification according to the level of the volume concentration of ethanol.</seg>
<seg id="132">Since 1 December 2013, the control tape newly contains two types of identifiers and the quantity of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging, expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, rounded down to whole millilitres.</seg>
<seg id="133">The register of control tapes for marking spirits contains daily records of individual ways of handling control tapes according to the registration codes, as well as the documents on the basis of which the registration was made.</seg>
<seg id="134">When specific control tapes are destroyed, lost or stolen, the holder is obliged to electronically notify the tax administrator of the registration code of the control tapes concerned and their number on the following working day after the decisive event.</seg>
<seg id="135">Introduction of new facts of the offences and adjustment of the amount of penalties imposed for infringements of legislation when handling control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="136">Penalties may be imposed up to the amount of excise duty or up to ten times higher (e.g. in case of destruction or loss of control tapes in the number exceeding 0.1% of the total quantity of the individual order of control tapes made, in case of failure to return control tapes within the statutory deadline).</seg>
<seg id="137">Limitation of the handling of control tapes only to registered holders, who may not pass them on to another person, with the exception of their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking spirits in consumer packaging manufactured outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">Exported control tapes must be placed on consumer packaging and imported back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of the distributor of spirits in consumer packaging provided that similar personal conditions are fulfilled as for the person obliged to mark spirits and with the obligation to deposit up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €185,000).</seg>
<seg id="140">Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of spirits in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="141">Eligible persons are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or to final sellers, or they may sell it as a final seller.</seg>
<seg id="142">They may acquire alcohol from other registered persons, the insolvency administrator, the administrative authority, organisational units of the state or unregistered persons in the execution of tax execution.</seg>
<seg id="143">Notifications of the introduction of alcohol or sale in consumer packaging into free tax circulation are required to be sent by the holders and distributors of alcohol to the tax administrator via the information system maintained by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or in compliance with the content in xml format, immediately following the decisive event.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification includes the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the volume percentage of alcohol, the European commodity code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or final seller, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.</seg>
<seg id="145">Tax entities sent approx. 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">Mandatory concession (a specific form of trade licence) not only for the production and modification of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or entrepreneurial natural person for his own internal use.</seg>
<seg id="147">Licensed trades can be carried out only after a decision has been issued by the trade licence office, subject to professional competence and other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="148">No prescribed professional competence is required for the sale of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="149">The benefit for the tax administrator is an overview of sellers and their establishments and the restriction of</seg>
<seg id="150">trading to reliable entities.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the Czech Republic, for the branch including the production, modification of fermentation alcohol, potable alcohol, spirits and other alcoholic beverages and sales, there were registered in 2014 about 94 thousand and in 2015 about 104 thousand concessions.</seg>
<seg id="152">Checks on compliance with legislation in the area of handling products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic are also ensured in their activities outside the tax administrator: trade offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection, the authorities of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the authorities of the Czech Trade Inspection.</seg>
<seg id="153">If they find that there has been a breach of duty or a violation of the prohibition, they will immediately inform the excise tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex No. 3, diagram B) to which mineral oils subject to excise duty but also selected mineral oils not subject to excise duty, which have been misused for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from the production of mineral oil through the storage, transport, marking and colouring of selected mineral oils, marking of certain other mineral oils up to delivery to the final consumer or user and in some cases the consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">The monitoring by the customs authorities includes the production of marking agents for the marking and handling of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="158">The marking and colouring of selected mineral oils are subject to the mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (kerosene others), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not elsewhere specified) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49, where their marking is not prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">For example, benzole, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion are subject to the marking and colouring of selected mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="160">The marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and certain other mineral oils is possible only with the permission of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="162">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which are a group of mineral oils under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: a flash point of less than 150 °C, at the distillation test at least 20 % of the volume, including losses, is distilled up to 350 °C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils have been misused as an additive in finished fuel, in particular diesel fuel, or have been directly used or sold for engine propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">The entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres must register with the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="167">The personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative must be fulfilled for the issuing of the registration, which is valid for the whole period 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by firing.</seg>
<seg id="168">3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="169">4 For example, when mineral oil is used as fuel (except for navigation on waters if it is not a private pleasure craft) or as a component for the production of fuel if the marking is defective in its use.</seg>
<seg id="170">registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">As of 30 November 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, four registrations were cancelled at the proposal of the holder of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="172">The electronic register shall contain detailed information on receipt, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil including document numbers, notification numbers of acquisition to the tax authorities, places of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or, on sale, place of delivery and customer registration number.</seg>
<seg id="173">Notification of any acquisition of special mineral oil shall be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours before receipt.</seg>
<seg id="174">The identification of trading partners, the name and nomenclature of the special mineral oil, quantity, purpose of consumption or information on sale or transfer shall be notified.</seg>
<seg id="175">Notification of the anticipated quantity of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed in the relevant year shall be submitted by the entity together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, the place of storage or consumption, the identification details of the person to whom the specific mineral oil is resold or transferred shall be transmitted before each change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications shall be submitted electronically by means of smart forms or a data box in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, persons handling specific mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.</seg>
<seg id="179">The seizure and confiscation of specific mineral oils or means of transport, as the case may be, must be declared by the tax administrator in cases where he finds the handling of specific mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to fulfil his reporting obligation.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of non-compliance with obligations in the transport of products subject to excise duty, these deficiencies cannot be remedied subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of a fuel distributor is compulsory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="183">Compulsory concession of the Trade Licensing Office (a specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">An opinion on the application for a concession, or on the appointment of a responsible representative, is given by the Customs Office, which examines whether the applicant for a concession, the statutory body or members of the statutory body of the applicant – legal persons and the appointed responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="185">If these persons meet the condition of reliability, the Customs Office issues an affirmative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person means a person of impeccable character from the point of view of criminal property, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">A condition for the issue of a concession is professional competence.</seg>
<seg id="188">Debt-free status of the same group of persons as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">A person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will fulfil his payment obligations to the State in a proper and timely manner, i.e. he has no arrears to the State budget and general health insurance, is a debtor.</seg>
<seg id="190">A fuel distributor may not be prohibited by a court or an administrative authority from carrying out his activity.</seg>
<seg id="191">A fuel distributor may not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="192">Deposit (or bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. approx. €740,000), which may be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e. approx. €370,000) after three years of registration of the fuel distributor and fulfilment of other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="193">The distributor is obliged to submit a notification of the fuel distribution to the customs office within 20 days after the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">The electronic notification must contain data on the individual purchase and sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="195">The notified data are data on business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="196">The claim for refund of the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">Claims for refund of excise duty on mineral oils can only be made for activities that are obviously related to activities carried out on land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were about 64,000 claims for refund of tax totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e. €43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced refund of excise duty on fuel to farmers with livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="200">Farmers or breeders who, for example, are engaged in cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will be newly able to claim this right.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term under-achievement of budgeted revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate in case of change of the tax rate with effect from 1 December 2014.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">The use of a tobacco sticker means its placement on a unit packet (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the application of the rate of excise duty, the decisive factor is the production of the tobacco product in the condition intended for the final consumer, without its removal from stock, delivery, dispatch or sale, or sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet characterizing the rate of excise duty is shown on the tobacco sticker together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, the sticker indicates the number of items in the packet, or the quantity of tobacco to be smoked in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">The tobacco sticker has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco sticker with the previous (old) rate of duty has been fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month after the new rate of excise duty took effect.</seg>
<seg id="210">The evolution of the removal of tobacco stickers in 2014 and the comparison with the evolution in previous years show that tobacco manufacturers significantly stockpiled each year with tobacco products bearing the ‘old’ rate of duty, thus effectively shifting the effectiveness of the ‘new’ rate of duty by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Raw tobacco tax</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the manufacture of tobacco products without the permission of the tax authority and the non-payment of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and the monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">With effect from 1 July 2015, raw tobacco which has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, supplied to another Member State or a third country, or for which the origin, purpose of use or the person to whom the raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been proved, is subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as the supervision of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, the marking of unit packets with surveillance tape and restrictions on sales at specified locations have been supplemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">The manufacturing facilities for the processing of tobacco raw materials and the manufacture of tobacco products are not subject to customs supervision.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or treated.</seg>
<seg id="218">Only a person meeting the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which applies throughout the registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions for registration are: (a) the right to operate a trade enabling the activity of the person storing the raw tobacco to be carried out, (b) reliability, (c) debt-free status, (d) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco has not been prohibited from carrying out its activity, (e) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the provision of a security of 20 000 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 740 000 €).</seg>
<seg id="220">The electronic register must include the date of receipt or issue of the raw tobacco, the document number, the identification of the business partner, the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">The notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by the registered person storing the raw tobacco must be made to the tax administrator between 24 and 72 hours before receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">The details of the business partner, the quantity of the raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of the use and the details of the carrier are reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">Notification of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of receipt or dispatch of raw tobacco is submitted by the entity together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications are submitted electronically through a data box in PDFa format.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed particulars.</seg>
<seg id="226">Excise tax legislation in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating the excise tax area in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">The individual types of excise tax are exhaustively determined by the legislation of the Slovak Republic, which is similar to the legislation of neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="230">The legislative regulation of excise taxes is ensured by four laws according to the individual subject of tax.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonisation has been achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No 98/2004 Coll., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Coll., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Coll., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Coll., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All laws on excise duties are substantive law regulations and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No 563/2009 Coll., on administration of taxes (Tax Code), is a regulation of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax subjects and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework transposed individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008, concerning the general regulation of excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and also transposed provisions of other European Community directives and legislation.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of control in the SR</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, legislation concerning the administration of excise duties has undergone several fundamental changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS system, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duties under the suspension regime has been changed from a paper accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system, where these transports are monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Within the EMCS electronic system, the institute of suspension of access for tax subjects to EMCS was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the possibility to suspend access precisely when there is a justified fear of unpaid or undetermined tax from previous tax periods and its unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This concerns the tax due, since the transport of excise goods requires the composition of a security, which is released by the termination of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A fundamental change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the option to use so-called red diesel was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">The labelled gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, belonged to mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of abolishing red diesel was to reduce the public deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely the fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal change was to introduce the obligation to keep a register for all petrol stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The clarification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from the fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely a fuel distributor and a fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and made the movement of these fuels more transparent (see Annex 4, Diagram A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, the legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils were extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">However, in the Slovak Republic, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to label with an indicator substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">As part of the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Material Act was extended and a new tax entity – a trader of tobacco raw material – was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, the obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks intended for the labelling of consumer packages of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">The control mark is used to identify cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the purchaser of control marks must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically, via the information system for the collection of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state printing house of control marks was established – in Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of control marks was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system for printing control marks strengthens the system for the control of goods, as a unique identification number is generated on the control mark to easily verify whether the goods originate from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">A unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd place is the control sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to the control stamp or to a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The control stamp intended for labelling cigarettes must also indicate the price of the cigarettes, the character for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in consumer packaging and the length of the cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">Alcohol, wine and beer were affected by the biggest legislative change as the original three substantive laws were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The law was drafted mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution of the taxation of alcoholic beverages, solution of their production, monitoring of movement, securing the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, to streamline the administration of the tax, to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of dealing with the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a uniform rate of excise duty on an alcoholic beverage and took into account the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content of the final product is taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer is also expressed in the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content of the final product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household up to a maximum of 1 000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation has introduced a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution and use of control stamps intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the purchaser of control stamps must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically by means of an information system for the collection of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step has introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state printer of control stamps has been established – in Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of control stamps has also been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes have significantly contributed to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Diagram B) and the elimination of counterfeiting of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system of printing control stamps strengthens the system of control of goods because a unique identification number is generated on the control stamp, which can be used to easily verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">The unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd place forms the control sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to the control stamp or to a group of packages; 4th place is the series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9th-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional bar code.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law no. 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Tax on solid fuels, tax on natural gas and certain other gases and tax on electricity are part of the law no. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, except the law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, which contains the tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic, since 1 January 2015, the issuance of the permit to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is subject, among other things, to proof of the economic stability of the applicants, which is verified by the customs authorities each year by carrying out a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In the Slovak Republic, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce the securing of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="292">The FR SR carries out tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control stamps for marking alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printing works and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is ensured by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control strips in the Czech Republic is not supervised by customs authorities in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control strips are taken over from the printer by the authorized territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers in this territorial office, control strips for marking alcohol are further distributed to individual locally competent tax administrators according to the place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control strips.</seg>
<seg id="298">In the Slovak Republic there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its part, in the Czech Republic there is no such obligation.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears the excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when the tobacco stickers are collected at the authorized customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, the control mark does not contain the excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils in case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green diesel, was introduced during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this refund has been extended to animal production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In the Slovak Republic, such support for farmers is not introduced (it existed until 31 December 2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of 20 million CZK (i.e. 740 thousand €) was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="305">As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 subjects in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1 717 tax subjects).</seg>
<seg id="306">In the Slovak Republic, a similar institute of fuel distributor is introduced, but without the deposit required to secure the excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">In the Slovak Republic, 303 distributors were registered in 2014 and in 2015, 407 distributors were registered.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the Slovak Republic, an institute of a fuel seller and a fuel consumer is introduced, which is issued with a permit by the locally competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">In the Czech Republic, such an institute is not introduced.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labelling, while in the Slovak Republic, following the abolition of the so-called red diesel, mineral oil labelling is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the alcohol labelling control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirit quality of the spirit according to which the control tape is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss and return of the control tape are recorded in the register on the following working day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The tape holder is obliged to notify their use within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In the Slovak Republic, the control mark intended to mark the alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which is communicated to the tax administrator once a month in case of its use, and serves to verify the authenticity of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register contains the number of control marks collected, used and claimed.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have introduced the institute of compulsory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="317">In the Slovak Republic, the registration is subject to the fulfilment of conditions related to, among other things, the storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of the consumer packaging of alcohol at least 100 000 € or the paid-up basic assets at least 100 000 €; a minimum number of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining the registration is subject, among other things, to the lodging of a deposit in the amount of 5 000 000 CZK (i.e. 185 000 €) in favour of the tax administrator for the whole period of validity of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="320">In the Slovak Republic, the permanent presence of the tax administrator is required for the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of the person obliged to mark alcohol, with the condition of a deposit in favour of the tax administrator ranging from CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) depending on the amount of control tapes collected and the installation of a monitoring device with continuous access of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic goes far beyond the minimum EU requirements for the subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to the identified risks from other Member States as well as to those identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">The legislative changes adopted during the audited period enable tax administrators to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, in order to combat tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw materials (e.g. leaves), an excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials was introduced in addition to the EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw materials are not a harmonised tobacco product, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movements.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic can recommend that this measure be applied also in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the verification of economic stability of applicants for the issuance of a permit under the Excise Tax Act has been successful because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such verifications also in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="330">Distribution of control stamps is more efficient in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs authorities with costs related to transport between the printer and the purchaser of control tapes and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The financial administration of the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the existence and location of technological facilities for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more efficient because the actual order of a tobacco sticker is a tax declaration with subsequent payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">The financial administration in the Slovak Republic has a better overview of the places of sale of fuel thanks to the introduction of the institutes of “fuel seller” and “fuel consumer”.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of compulsory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic allows easier control of misuse of mineral oils with reduced tax rate or tax exempted.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and the Slovak Republic (2014) a new control tape or a stamp containing an identification code has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains an identification code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="337">The impacts cannot yet be evaluated due to the short effectiveness of the legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective marking of consumer packaging of alcohol with a control mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic can recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States as well.</seg>
<seg id="340">The attitude of the Slovak Republic to the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterized by a pro-ient approach, which does not block the funds of tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="341">On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive, as it introduces a deposit on the cash flow of tax entities, but reduces the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of excise tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise tax is an indirect tax introduced by the state in order to increase the revenues of the state budget and also to regulate the amount of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered to be harmful to individuals and/or society (the tax's regulatory function).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Commission's communication: EUROPE 2020 – A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3 March 2010, within the framework of the flagship initiative "Resource-efficient Europe", the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of instruments on the basis of the market, including in the form of a revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should try to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxation, among other things, within the framework of a greater "greening" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of excise tax revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise tax on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise taxes in total tax revenues and the share in GDP is monitored by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), among others.</seg>
<seg id="348">The two supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter a query on the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise taxes in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise taxes in total tax revenues and the share in GDP decreased slightly, according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">The ECB's rate of the European Central Bank was used to convert amounts in CZK into € on 31 December of the relevant year.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 depreciated by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25.140 to 27.425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of the collection of excise duties, rates of excise duties and income per capita in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant decrease in the share of excise duties in 2014 was caused by a one-off shortfall in excise tax revenues from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duties is also influenced by the increase in the collection of income taxes, which increased significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">Excise duty on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the total collection of excise duties (in 2015 about 55.7%), but it decreased despite the significant growth of the economy compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, even though the registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible share is accounted for by the natural gas tax, the solid fuel tax and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="361">If there is no increase in rates, their share will decrease in the future in view of the ever decreasing energy intensity of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale case of tax fraud consisting in putting untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or underdenatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, after the adoption of a number of measures against such behaviour and after the revival of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the collection of 2012 by €4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">The proportion of tax on tobacco products increased due to increasing rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The standard rates of excise duties changed between 2012 and 2015 for the tax on tobacco products, with an increase in the rate mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, fell significantly. It has risen only slightly for tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="367">In relation to price growth, GDP or the standard of living, there is no indexation of the rate of excise duties, so the function of excise duties to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With economic growth in the Czech Republic and rising living standards, real rates of excise duties are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment is made on the basis of a law or a contract (in the case of pensions paid by the state it is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="371">In the current legislation on excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the indexation of the rates of excise duties to the development of consumer prices is not addressed, because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="374">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="375">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="376">Of all excise duties introduced in Slovakia, excise duty on mineral oils has the largest share of the state budget's annual tax revenue, while its share did not fall below 52% in the whole audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">The second largest share is reported by excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">This tax represents on average about 32% share of the total excise tax collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, the collection of excise duty per capita of the Slovak Republic increased.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is caused by the growth of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The increase in excise duty collection per capita of the Slovak Republic is constant and corresponds to the development of rates of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention regarding the exchange rate of the crown against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in total SPD collection is mainly due to the collection of excise duties on mineral oils and tobacco products, which in the Czech Republic are approximately 2.7 and 2.8 times higher, respectively, but per capita of the Czech Republic the collection on these selected products is only about 1/3 higher.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK against € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">In the case of the mineral oil tax, it is also due to greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of the tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a non-negligible influence.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic have been declining as a result of the CNB's interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the achieved values of the share of excise duties are consistently above the average of the OECD.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is influenced mainly by the change in excise duty rates, the development of the economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future shortfalls in the collection of excise duties due to environmental measures subsidised by the state in various forms will have to be replaced by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="392">The fact that the indexation of excise duty rates is not introduced in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic reduces their regulatory function and is insufficiently supported by the EU's objectives of making Europe less dependent on environmentally unfriendly sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic is reflected in higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the mutual relationship between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The efficiency of the tax administration influences the competence and organisational arrangement of the tax administration, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of computerisation of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The determination of the efficiency of administrative costs of the tax administration by the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a line-managed structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is performed, among other activities, by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organisational unit of the state and an accounting unit.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs administration bodies are an internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included in aggregate for the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility to compare the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic have been included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some partial control tasks are performed by other public administration bodies, but their importance is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="405">The administration of excise duties is performed mainly by the following departments:</seg>
<seg id="406">General Directorate of Customs</seg>
<seg id="407">Department 23 TAXATION</seg>

<seg id="433">Administrative costs of excise administration in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="434">Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a demanding transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The creation of DG SR was also reflected in the staff composition of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the context of the excise administration, the excise administration activities within the organisational structure of DG SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related departments.</seg>

<seg id="449">Customs office branch – decides on the registration (except tax warehouse, authorised receiver for repeated receipt, registered sender), the amount of the tax security; prescribes and refunds the tax; performs the tax supervision and tax control; decides on the security and forfeiture of goods;</seg>
<seg id="450">Customs office station – performs tax supervision over the holding and movement of goods subject to excise taxes; ensures the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouse for alcohol; decides on security and on forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">Expenditure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic on administration of excise taxes is constantly increasing, as with the exception of wage growth investments for effective administration of taxes and computerisation of the financial administration are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although revenue from excise taxes was increasing, expenditure due to IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project was growing faster.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure in the Slovak Republic is significantly influenced by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which the Czech Republic does not apply.</seg>
<seg id="454">Expenditure of the Customs administration of excise taxes increased more significantly in 2015 between 2012 and 2015, this growth was caused mainly by growth of wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, revenue from excise taxes also grew at approximately the same pace.</seg>
<seg id="456">Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the broader competences of the customs administration, e.g. weighing of trucks, monitoring of compliance with obligations in connection with tolls.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly worsening trend year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee grew.</seg>
<seg id="459">Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee grew more slowly compared to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, a significant factor of the worsened efficiency of administrative expenditure is the growth of wages, which can be evaluated as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in the administration of excise taxes appears to be a negative factor, which is confirmed by the non-decreasing number of employees in the area of administration of excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="463">In the Slovak Republic, however, the administration of excise taxes with lower revenues is significantly more demanding in terms of personnel capacity.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators of administration of excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="465">The administration of excise taxes is a set of activities aimed at correctly finding, determining and securing the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the administration of excise taxes are the assessment of taxes, authorisation and registration for activities, supervision of transport, control and searching of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The numbers of administrative acts and entities managed are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="468">The mutual relationship between the monitored indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the effectiveness of the activity of the tax administrator and defines the cost of a specific activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisation and registration for activities are the basic prerequisite for the handling of selected products for commercial purposes and their transport under the regime of conditional exemption from tax.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to perform systematic administration for entities with authorisation or registration with a focus on supervision of compliance with legal regulations and conditions set by the tax administrator, to which adequate staffing resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The monitored indicator was the number of valid permits or registrations for the activity as of 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of issued permits or registrations is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in a matter.</seg>
<seg id="474">The monitored administrative acts are the frequency of the most important acts of the tax administrator (tax claims, transport administration in EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of acts ending with a report or a decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Authorisation and registration for the activity in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">Selected products can be produced, processed, stored, received or dispatched on the basis of the permission of the tax administrator to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the tax warehouse operator has more than one warehouse, the permission for each is issued separately, including tax security.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. the physical presence of a public official and the securing of the facility by the conclusions of the tax administrator).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, the permanent tax supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">The tax warehouse operator is also registered for tax pursuant to Section 125 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">The permit to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products conditionally exempt from tax from the point of import to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to the point of export in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (it replaces the status of a registered consignor pursuant to Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels without tax, which are analogous to tax warehouse permits.</seg>
<seg id="485">The distiller produces ethyl alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (14 300 CZK/hl ethanol) – fruit distillates for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the permit to operate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower destined for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The register of crop burning kept by the distiller's operators and made available to the tax authorities must contain data on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">The authorised recipient for repeated receipt of selected products and the authorised recipient for one-off receipt of selected products is entitled, under the tax authorities' permission and the conditions laid down, to receive or repeatedly receive selected products in a conditional system transported from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The authorised recipient is not a tax warehouse operator and may not store or dispatch selected products under the conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of selected products exempt from tax is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or under § 52a or § 53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll. sells to another user selected products exempt from tax; users have the status of tax subjects without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">Selected products exempt from tax may be received and used only on the basis of a final authorization, and only from a supplier specified in the authorization.</seg>
<seg id="492">On the basis of the authorization, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of the authorization for use or to a user who is authorized to use mineral oils without authorization.</seg>
<seg id="493">Mineral oils exempt from tax may be sold without authorization in cases stipulated by law, such as:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils in quantities of less than 10,000 liters per calendar year if the user himself produced them or arose in the course of his activity;</seg>
<seg id="495">selected mineral oils exempt from tax in unit packs with a capacity of not more than 20 liters intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production, and at the same time intended for sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">Selected products exempt from tax may be transported with proof of exemption.</seg>
<seg id="497">The distributor of alcohol in consumer packs is authorized to sell or otherwise transfer alcohol released for free tax circulation after compulsory registration with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="498">The storer of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products, based on registration with the tax authority and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="499">A person handling special mineral oils is entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils that are in bulk or placed in packaging exceeding 220 litres, based on registration with the tax authority and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="500">The fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel in the Czech Republic, with the exception of the sale of fuel from a petrol station, based on the issued concession and registration with the tax authority under the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="501">Transport of fuel must be accompanied by a tax document, a proof of sale or a proof of transport, or by a distribution plan and bottling tickets.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent to the tax authority before the transport begins.</seg>
<seg id="503">The operator of the petrol station is the owner of the fuel sold at the petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where the sale or issue of fuel, usually in the fuel tank, is permitted on the basis of a permit from the building authority.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators in the following breakdown: registered – normal sale or issue of fuel, usually in the fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined approach – operation usually in various company premises (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, construction yards), sales are made here for the other party limited on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public – fuel dispensing points only for the operators' own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="506">A petrol station is not a construction or installation in the form of an operational tank placed in operation (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is dispensed only for own use.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to a permit from the tax administrator and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free tax circulation for resale on the basis of the permission of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="509">They must also have permission if they purchase or acquire liquefied petroleum gases for own consumption that exceeds 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative acts in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">Tax control is a set of acts. The subject of tax control is tax obligations, statements of a tax entity or other circumstances relevant for the correct determination and determination of the tax related to one tax procedure.</seg>
<seg id="512">Tax control may be carried out jointly for more than one tax procedure of a tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">Repeated tax control may be carried out only under the conditions laid down by law and justified when the control is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tax inspection is carried out within the time limit for determining the tax, which is three years, with the time limit being extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. the filing of additional tax proceedings, the initiation of criminal proceedings in connection with the tax in question) or suspended (judicial proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The time limit for determining the tax expires at the latest ten years after the expiry of the time limit for filing a proper tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">The tax administrator is not obliged to carry out a tax inspection for each tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">The initiation of a tax inspection suspends the time limits for the possibility of filing an additional tax return or additional statement by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the time limit for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">Based on its result, an ex officio assessment of the tax can be made.</seg>
<seg id="519">A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) during which the tax administrator searches for evidence and carries out an inspection of premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging at tax entities and other persons involved in the tax administration, on the spot outside the tax administrator's premises (e.g. at the tax entity, at a sales point, on the way during transport).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and items, take samples, or secure them.</seg>
<seg id="521">Based on the result of a local investigation, the tax cannot be separately assessed, but the tax entity may be invited to file an additional tax return (Section 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">The inspection of traffic data in the EMCS system is not a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="523">The order of control tapes for alcohol marking may be submitted to the tax administrator to the locally appropriate place of marking only by a registered person obliged to mark alcohol and is carried out through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the register of alcohol signers.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered quantity of control strips and orders the production.</seg>
<seg id="525">He does not supervise the production of control strips.</seg>
<seg id="526">The production is provided by the State Printing House, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="527">The customer of control strips receives control strips from the tax administrator of the locally appropriate place of labeling.</seg>
<seg id="528">The order for tobacco stickers for the labelling of cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco fulfils the function of a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco stickers corresponds to the amount of the tax liability, while the purchaser of the tobacco stickers is obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their withdrawal from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="530">The purchaser is obliged to calculate in the order himself the value corresponding to the amount of the tax liability of the tobacco stickers ordered.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period applies only if the value of the tobacco stickers is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order for tobacco stickers is submitted on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance in writing or through a data box with the possibility of using smart forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco stickers is ensured by the State Printing House of Valuables, a state enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorized tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (territorial workplace Kutná Hora), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, who distributes them and further checks their transport, storage and use at the purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include proper tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including orders for tobacco stickers, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">Tax returns in the framework of customs proceedings based on customs declarations and claims for refund of tax on: mineral oils used for heat production, other gasolines used in the course of business activities other than for heat production or engine propulsion, mineral oils used for agricultural primary production are not included.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with established violations of legislation, involving a set of consecutive administrative actions. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: a request for administrative cooperation, a response to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, an event report, an inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport under the conditional tax exemption regime between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States – the Czech customs office is the tax administrator of the receiving or sending tax warehouse or authorised recipient.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="540">Authorisation and registration to operate in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="541">The administration of excise taxes in the Slovak Republic is mainly ensured by the customs offices and the excise tax department of the Customs and Tax Division of the Slovak Republic, whose procedure for the administration of excise taxes is regulated by the individual laws on excise taxes and the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws stipulate not only the scope of authorisation for the CA and the Slovak Tax Administration in the administration of excise taxes, but also the rights and obligations of tax subjects in connection with the registration or payment of excise tax.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase of tax subjects (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, which was caused by an increase in issued permits within tax warehouses, an increase in registrations of authorised recipients for repeated receipt and registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils, as well as the obligation to notify if they are transported in bulk or in packaging with a capacity of more than 150 litres and 230 litres respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to inspection and the procedure during transport to other goods, e.g. anti-knock preparations, oxidation inhibitors, bitumen inhibitors, viscosity enhancement preparations, anti-corrosion preparations.</seg>
<seg id="545">A mandatory indication of the kinematic viscosity of lubricating oils has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="546">An approximation of the registration process with selected tax entities in the sense of national legislation in the Slovak Republic is given in the following parts of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a tax warehouse operator in all objects of excise duties, a person who wishes to operate a tax warehouse must simultaneously apply for registration and issue of a permit to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is the certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CA issues a tax warehouse operating permit which entitles the tax warehouse operator to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="551">In the event that the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in more than one location, the tax administrator issues a separate tax warehouse operating permit for each tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The movement of excise goods under suspension of duty is monitored electronically through the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each shipment, the so-called</seg>
<seg id="554">The ARC code under which the traffic can be monitored online and therefore in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the tax warehouse operator is also the person authorised to distribute the spirit, he shall notify electronically to the CA the commercial name of the consumer packaging of the spirit, the volume and volume concentration of the spirit in the consumer packaging of the spirit and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free circulation, at the latest on the date of its release.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered Sender</seg>
<seg id="557">A registered consignor is a special type of tax entity which cannot be simultaneously registered also as a tax warehouse operator, even if he sends the excise object under the duty suspension regime after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under the national legislation of the Slovak Republic, when registering a registered consignor under all excise objects, a person who wishes to send the excise object under the duty suspension regime after its release for the customs “free circulation” regime must simultaneously apply to the CA to register and issue an authorisation to send the excise object under this regime.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and also an authorisation to send the excise object under the duty suspension regime after its release for the customs “free circulation” regime.</seg>
<seg id="560">Grower's distillery</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic act for the operation of a grower's distillery is to obtain an authorisation for the production of alcohol in a distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the authorisation itself from the Ministry does not authorise the holder of the authorisation to operate a grower's distillery.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order to operate a grower's distillery, a person must submit an application to the CA for registration and issue of a certificate of registration of the operator of the grower's distillery.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CA issues a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which at the same time authorises the operator of the grower's distillery to produce alcohol in a grower's distillery.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of a grower's distillery is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">A grower's distillery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislature allows a reduced rate of tax to be applied to alcohol produced in a grower's distillery at a rate of 50% of the basic rate of tax, i.e. 540 €/hl a.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced rate of tax applies to alcohol produced in the distillery, at a rate of no more than 43 l a. per grower and his household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year, and therefore a reduced rate of tax may be applied to the alcohol produced more than once in the same calendar year, as the alcohol in question is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This is the production of alcohol outside the suspensive regime, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays not only the excise duty and value added tax but also the price of the services provided to the distillery for the alcohol produced.</seg>
<seg id="573">The distillery issues the grower with an exit certificate, which serves not only as proof of proof of the origin and method of acquisition of the alcohol, but also of payment of the excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of the alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="575">Consumer packet importer</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons intending to import, in the course of their business, consumer packets of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country and to place them in free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packets.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of consumer packets does not register for the excise duty in question, but the CA issues him a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packets.</seg>
<seg id="578">This certificate entitles the importer to import consumer packets of alcohol or consumer packets of cigarettes from the territory of a third country.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, he must lodge a tax security for the amount of tax on the quantity of alcohol or cigarettes he wishes to place in free tax circulation before the issue of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of consumer packets must put into free tax circulation only consumer packets marked with a control stamp.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, he must present to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the control stamps exported to the territory of a third country.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer is obliged to have the customs office of importation confirm the number of control marks imported back from the territory of the third country.</seg>
<seg id="583">On importation of the consumer packaging, the importer proceeds in the sense of the customs regulations, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the case of release of the consumer packaging into free tax circulation, the tax security lodged is returned to the importer or can be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of the consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the importer of the consumer packaging of alcohol is also the person authorised to distribute the alcohol, he is obliged to notify electronically to the CA the commercial name of the consumer packaging of the alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of the alcohol in the consumer packaging of the alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation, at the latest on the day of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="587">Seller of the consumer packaging of the alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of the alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislator has introduced a new tax institute of the seller of the consumer packaging of the alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person wishing to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CA for a permit and fulfil the legal conditions (trade licence for a commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; he/she has not had his/her permit for sale withdrawn for a period of ten years; he/she is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As it is a consumer packaging of the alcohol in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution licence, is sufficient to prove how the consumer packaging of the alcohol was acquired.</seg>
<seg id="592">The holder of the authorisation is required to keep a record for each establishment in respect of the calendar month of the number of units of consumer packaging of alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol as at the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of units of consumer packaging of alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to purchase the alcohol in consumer packaging or otherwise take it in the course of business only from the person authorised to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, the legislator has introduced a new tax institute, the distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person wishing to hold a distribution authorisation must apply to the CA for a distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must comply with the legal conditions (trade licence for a commercial trade; storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol of at least €100,000 or paid-up capital of at least €100,000; minimum number of 10 employees; no arrears to the customs office; no arrears of compulsory levies; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; no authorisation to sell has been withdrawn for 10 years; he is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As this is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, an invoice, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution licence, is sufficient to prove how the consumer packaging of alcohol was acquired.</seg>
<seg id="600">The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to keep a record for each establishment for the calendar month of the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received, the number of units of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol issued, the stock of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of the distribution authorisation is obliged to purchase ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorised to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorised to distribute notifies the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Fuel seller</seg>
<seg id="604">In order to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity, namely the fuel seller, has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation regulating petrol stations in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="606">Therefore, petrol stations are incorporated as fuel sellers in the national legislation of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person who wants to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation in the tax territory is obliged to ask the CA for a permit for the sale before the sale begins and to submit a document proving that the storage facility is verified and equipped with a suitable verified measuring device enabling the quantity of mineral oil to be measured on receipt and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the fuel seller is a tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or registered consignor, the CA will also automatically issue a permit for the sale of fuel to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">The fuel seller is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep a record of petrol, diesel or LPG bought and sold in a calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CA of a new supplier (distributor) of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="610">The fuel seller is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As the fuel is in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when the fuel is delivered by car tanker, the distributor prints a so-called bottler from a measuring device built into the car tanker when the fuel is pumped to the seller.</seg>
<seg id="613">In addition to the quantity data, the document also contains the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the Tax Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="615">The Tax Inspector in the territory of the Slovak Republic records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods when exercising tax supervision over mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="616">In particular, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks during transport, so hauliers use secondary road roads, bypassing the toll collection system due to the more difficult monitoring of actual transports.</seg>
<seg id="617">Also, transports of mineral oils are carried out in converted double-bottomed tankers.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times, illegal transports are accompanied by a vehicle which reports to the haulier possible mobile patrols in order to change the route and avoid roadside checks.</seg>
<seg id="619">Also, fuel is mixed with light fuel oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">In order to monitor fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely the fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in free circulation in the tax territory as part of a business is required to apply to the customs office for a distribution permit before the distribution begins and to produce a document proving that the storage facility is verified and equipped with a suitable verified measuring device, as well as a list of suppliers and customers.</seg>
<seg id="623">The fuel distributor is required, among other legal obligations, to keep a record of petrol, diesel or LPG purchased and sold for a calendar month separately for each establishment.</seg>
<seg id="624">The fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">The fuel distributor may sell in the tax territory only to the fuel distributor, a registered person or a fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when the fuel is delivered by car tanker, the distributor prints out a so-called bottler from the measuring device installed in the car tanker when the fuel is pumped to the fuel seller or the fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="627">In addition to the data relating to the quantity, the said document also contains the date and time of delivery and the vehicle registration number assigned by the transport inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As the fuel is in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required when transporting the goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor or the registered person assigned by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="630">Fuel consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">The fuel consumer has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in free tax circulation for his own consumption in the tax territory and stores this mineral oil in a storage facility with a capacity of 15 000 litres or more is obliged to notify the customs office no later than before the first placing in the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="633">The fuel consumer is recorded by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="634">The customs office is obliged, in addition to the legal facts, to indicate the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage facility must be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the quantity of fuel to be measured at reception and delivery (gauge, measuring rod).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must purchase fuel only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As the fuel is in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when the fuel is delivered by car tanker, the distributor prints out a so-called bottling device from the measuring device incorporated in the car tanker when the fuel is pumped to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">The said document contains, in addition to the data concerning the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor allocated by the Tax Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Tax Inspectorate in the territory of the Slovak Republic, when exercising tax supervision over mineral oils, records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who, in the course of his business, produces beer and fulfils the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Provided that the legal conditions are fulfilled, a small independent brewery can apply a reduced tax rate, i.e. 2,652 € per hl/percent of the volume of the actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="647">The annual production of beer is limited to a quantity of up to 200 000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As it is a production of beer outside the conditional exemption regime, the transport does not require an accompanying document as it is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, it is a small family business which also operates restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own production of beer for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative operations in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="652">This sub-chapter approximates the exercise of tax supervision of the administration of excise duties for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (5,3 %) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was caused by the realisation of more transport operations in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="654">By contrast, the largest decrease was recorded year-on-year in 2014, by up to 4.3%, which was due to a smaller number of completed tax inspections and fewer tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="655">This decrease related to legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax inspections</seg>
<seg id="657">Through the performance of the tax inspection, the CA detects or verifies facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">In the performance of the tax inspection, the employees of the CA are shown a mandate to perform the tax inspection, which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject of the inspection and the extent of the audited tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period can be one month, but also more tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The extent of the audited tax periods is determined by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="661">The tax inspection starts with the writing of the report on the commencement of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="662">The receipt of documents is confirmed by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="663">The borrowed documents are required to be returned by the CA within 30 days of the completion of the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="664">The CA employee draws up a report from the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax audit reveals a difference in the total that the audited tax entity should have paid, reported or claimed a tax refund for, the CA, together with the report, also sends the audited tax entity an invitation to comment on the findings in the report.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax audit is completed on the date of receipt of the report.</seg>
<seg id="667">The deadline for carrying out the tax audit is a maximum of one year from the date of its commencement.</seg>
<seg id="668">The tax audit of registered persons and selected registered persons is carried out as necessary, but at least once before the date of the expiry of the right to determine the tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FR SR issued an internal management act which modified the above mentioned deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax administrator in the territory of the SR.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigation</seg>
<seg id="671">Local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains facts that are needed for the purposes of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">The CA employee draws up a report on the local investigation and submits a copy thereof to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="673">In carrying out the local investigation, the employee of the CA has the right to unlimited access to the land, to the operational buildings, to the rooms and to places including means of transport, transport packaging and to accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The accounting of the quantity of alcohol produced is ascertained in the form of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The ascertained facts are the basis for carrying out the tax inspection.</seg>
<seg id="676">Also in carrying out the local investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the matter.</seg>
<seg id="677">FŘ SR issued an internal management act, which regulated the carrying out of the tax supervision and local investigation for individual objects of excise taxes in order to unify the procedures of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1.5.2004, a change also occurred in the area of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the administration of excise duty on alcohol, improvement of the business environment in the given area and introduction of legislative instruments for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the given area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in connection with the administration of excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administration in the area of excise tax administration from tax offices to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administration to be present in the tax warehouse for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation defines exhaustively that it is only possible to receive, issue, produce or process alcohol in the tax warehouse in the presence of an employee of the CA.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to the tax warehouse that receives, stores or dispatches alcohol only in consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CA is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse in order not to limit the receipt, issue, production or processing of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator is obliged to safeguard the working environment conditions for the employees of the CA.</seg>
<seg id="686">On the basis of a contract concluded with the FD SR for the premises provided, the CA pays the tax warehouse operator monthly for the rental costs.</seg>
<seg id="687">In a tax warehouse during the production, processing or storage of the alcohol, the production facility for storing the alcohol must be adapted so that the quantity of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, stored alcohol including the stocks of the alcohol and the alcohol contained therein can be ascertained at any time.</seg>
<seg id="688">THISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="689">If the alcohol in the tax warehouse is not accepted, issued, produced or processed, the customs office may waive the obligation to secure the presence of the customs office employee, while it is obliged to secure this area by sealing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">In practice, however, this possibility is too often not used, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of the customs office employee for their benefit.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators use a legal option within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 Coll., on the production and marketing of ethyl alcohol, and use the production equipment for the production of ethyl alcohol in a distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of a distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Around 250 customs officers ensure the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issuing vouchers for the collection of control stamps for ethyl alcohol</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of control stamps is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration sampling number and to issue a voucher for the collection of control stamps for ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="695">An alcoholic beverage, which is ethyl alcohol, means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength exceeding 1,2 % vol.</seg>
<seg id="696">The control mark is intended for the labelling of the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol is considered to be a closed consumer packaging filled with ethyl alcohol intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging falling within Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be put into free tax circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee and the importer of the immediate packaging may mark the immediate packaging of ethyl alcohol with a control mark and place it in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="700">The control mark contains, among other things, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical digit. The identification number contains the registration withdrawal number (1st-6th digit), the volume of ethyl alcohol (7th-11th digit) and the volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the immediate packaging (12th-14th digit).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original model of the control mark for ethyl alcohol:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration withdrawal number is assigned separately by the CA to each purchaser of the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only the control mark whose identification number corresponds to the volume of the consumer packaging, the volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in consumer packaging and the purchaser's control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">National legislation introduced a new information system for control marks towards the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="705">The new information system for control marks aimed at simplifying and computerising the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks intended for the labelling of consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of consumer packaging and the consignee (purchaser) of ethyl alcohol may mark the consumer packaging of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="707">The purchaser of control marks who wishes to take control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of control marks electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the buyer of control marks is obliged to apply for their issue, to notify the data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of control marks.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of ordered pieces of control marks must not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.</seg>
<seg id="710">The tax administrator also communicates with buyers of control marks through the electronic system of control marks, especially when notifying the number of control marks that the buyer of control marks can take away or when determining the date of receipt of control marks by the buyer of control marks at the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="711">The buyer of control marks is obliged to deposit on the tax administrator's account the funds corresponding to the price of control marks that he can take away and the quantity of which is notified by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the control mark takes into account the amount of refunds to the printing works. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">The control marks are authorised to be printed by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="714">The FR SR carries out tax supervision over the handling of the control stamps and their disposal at the printer.</seg>
<seg id="715">The FR SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the financial directorate at the printer when handling the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="716">The FR SR ensures the sale of the control stamps to the purchaser of the control stamps at the printer.</seg>
<seg id="717">The withdrawal of control stamps is possible only at the printer from an employee of the financial directorate.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issuing of vouchers for the collection of control stamps for tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="719">The purchaser of the control stamp must ask the CA to assign a registration collection number and issue a voucher for the collection of the control stamp.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packs of cigarettes can only be put into free tax circulation if they are marked with a control stamp.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is only possible to mark consumer packs of cigarettes with a control stamp in a company that produces cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The purchaser of control marks can only be a tax warehouse operator, an authorised consignee or an importer of tobacco products who wants to put tobacco products into free tax circulation in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only a control mark can be used to mark a consumer pack of cigarettes, the data of which correspond to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of cigarettes, the tax rate validity sign and the registration withdrawal number.</seg>
<seg id="724">A consumer pack of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the control mark.</seg>
<seg id="725">National legislation introduced a new information system for control marks at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="726">The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using control marks intended for the marking of consumer packs of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">A purchaser of control stamps who wants to take control stamps under the "new system" must apply to the customs office for the issue of control stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the purchaser of control stamps is obliged to apply for their issuance, to notify data resulting from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and to keep a register of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="729">Control stamps are authorised to be printed by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="730">The FR SR carries out tax supervision over the handling of control stamps and their disposal at the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="731">The FR SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the financial directorate at the printing works when handling control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="732">The FR SR ensures the sale of control stamps to a purchaser of control stamps at the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="733">Control stamps can only be taken at the printing works from an employee of the financial directorate.</seg>
<seg id="734">The operator of a tax warehouse or an importer of tobacco products may mark consumer packages of tobacco or cigarillos with a control stamp.</seg>
<seg id="735">The operator of the tax warehouse, the importer of tobacco products or an authorised consignee may mark consumer tobacco packaging or cigarillos with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="736">Only the control mark, the data of which correspond to the character for the validity of the rate of excise duty, shall be used to mark consumer tobacco packaging with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="737">Only in the company that produced them may mark consumer cigarette packaging with a control mark.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of ordered pieces of control stamps may not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.</seg>
<seg id="739">The CA shall electronically notify the purchaser of control stamps within three working days at the latest of the number of control stamps which it can withdraw, the price of control stamps and the account number of the FR SR.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CA may reduce the number of ordered pieces of control stamps if circumstances have arisen on the basis of which it is reasonable to assume that a violation of tax regulations may occur.</seg>
<seg id="741">The FR SR shall determine the date of receipt of control stamps by the purchaser of control stamps, but not later than 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The date of receipt of control stamps is announced by the FD SR via the electronic system of control stamps to the purchaser of control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="743">Control stamps are issued by the Financial Directorate exclusively at the printing works, but only after the receipt of the funds corresponding to their price to the respective account indicated in the electronic notification of the Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="744">The purchaser of control stamps is obliged to keep the registration of control stamps separately in the electronic system of control stamps for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="745">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)</seg>
<seg id="746">Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the Department of ELO and SPD systems of the Excise Tax Department of the FD SR is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information on the basis of a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent financial administration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="747">These include, in particular, requests for verification of entities within the excise tax administration, requests for information concerning the excise tax administration and also requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of requests takes place in electronic form within the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following acts are included in the administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on the excise tax administration, request for confirmation of registration in the SEED); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Permission and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the SR, tax warehouses are subject to permanent tax supervision for alcohol, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by the tax administration through a monitoring device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouses, in the SR they are only registered by the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the SR, the registered consignor institute is introduced, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In the Slovak Republic it is possible to burn 43 l a at a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in case of cultivation burning.</seg>
<seg id="757">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of tax on alcohol can be applied only for 30 l a.</seg>
<seg id="758">Growing brandy in the Slovak Republic must have authorisation not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, growing brandy is only authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="760">In the Slovak Republic, import of consumer packaging of alcohol is carried out by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol in addition to the tax warehouse operator.</seg>
<seg id="761">Authorisation of the importer is conditional on registration of the applicant with the excise tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special authorisation by the tax administrator is required for import of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In the Slovak Republic, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is conditional on the issuance of authorisation by the tax administrator for the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a legal obligation to keep a record of, among other things, the purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for final sellers of consumer packaging of alcohol, the issuance of a concession for the sale of alcohol by the trade office is sufficient; the final seller does not keep any special record.</seg>
<seg id="766">In the Slovak Republic, the seller of fuel must have a permit from the tax administrator to sell it.</seg>
<seg id="767">National legislation in the Slovak Republic does not regulate petrol stations by any special regulation, all activities related to petrol stations are regulated only by the Excise Tax Act on Mineral Oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by the Special Fuel Act, however, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and a list of them is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In the Slovak Republic, it is technically not possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial administration system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In the Slovak Republic, the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities has increased significantly since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was caused by a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of a deposit for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative acts</seg>
<seg id="775">In the Slovak Republic, substantive legislation stipulates the obligation to carry out tax inspections of selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is further specified by an internal management act issued by the Slovak Ministry of Finance due to the application of a uniform procedure of tax administrators in the territory of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to carry out tax inspections, the procedural regulation only stipulates the possibility to carry out inspections at the latest by the deadline for tax assessment.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections carried out and local inspections in the Slovak Republic is the fact that the internal management act of the Slovak Ministry of Finance stipulates in which cases and within which deadlines the tax administrator must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to the increase in the number of EMCS traffic and at the same time due to the increase in the number of tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the Slovak Republic the number of administrative operations had a slightly increasing trend between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the increasing number of EMCS traffic and at the same time by the decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and tax entity registrations were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative operations of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In the Slovak Republic the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same amount of administrative operations.</seg>
<seg id="785">From the above it can be stated that the Slovak Republic focuses more on carrying out administrative operations by tax administrators, e.g. the performance of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, emphasis is placed more on remote supervision, e.g. monitoring equipment, immediate sending of data via a web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronicization of administrative acts</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronicization of administrative acts in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be filed via a data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Czech Customs Administration has introduced so-called interactive forms of tax returns, which however cannot be further processed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must be further transcribed into the personal tax account of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is a reduction in the error rate of filed tax returns (DAPs), which saves the tax administrator's actions related to the management of corrections of erroneously filed DAPs.</seg>
<seg id="793">The DG is working on a new application for electronic processing of DAPs.</seg>
<seg id="794">Through intelligent forms, it is also possible to: file tax applications or registration for activities and notifications of data changes, file claims for tax refunds, fulfill reporting obligations when handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco and fulfilling obligations in the field of biofuels.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax subjects in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registered entities for registration by the tax administrator of specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under the regime of conditional exemption from tax must be realized in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be realized with a document proving their taxation, a proof of exemption from excise tax, a decision of the customs office to release selected products into the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision to assess excise tax.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of data is determined by legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="799">To facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This allows the paper form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to a data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">JIK serves for the purposes of control by customs authorities on the way and makes repeated transport on the same document impossible.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest operator of a tax warehouse of fuel in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of fuel into free tax circulation, CS CR has online access to an electronic registration system, into which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for recording and monitoring the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should use 70% of the existing functional specification of EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be a user-familiar environment for declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to the system of global guarantees, to the register of tax entities or to the system of risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of reference numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the existing procedure for the registration of transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the misuse of a simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronicization of administrative operations in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="810">In the administration of excise taxes, the Slovak Republic Financial Administration uses electronic communication for monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under the regime of conditional exemption, control marks, filing of tax returns and also for registering and registering tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, one-way electronic communication of tax subjects with the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">Within the electronic communication, the tax subject has access to a personal Internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the tax subject has access to an electronic mailroom, through which he/she submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents related to the administration of excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through the personal Internet zone does not concern all tax subjects.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">These are mainly VAT payers, tax advisors representing the tax entity and attorneys representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">During the audit, the SAO SR also dealt with the issue of the scope of computerisation of the administration of excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">If transport carried out in the EMCS system is not included, there has been an increase in computerisation of selected comparable administrative acts, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">In the SR, fully computerised processing of tax returns is already in place, from its submission to the registration of tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, the electronic processing of tax returns is not set up.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities to insert on the website obligatory documents for individual transport in free tax circulation is set up.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the reporting of transport operations in free tax circulation is being prepared in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting transport operations in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise tax was not paid in violation of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in the Slovak Republic in the area of computerisation of tax returns, the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend to complete computerisation of tax return processing in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organisational structure and personnel security in the area of excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organisational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic since 1 January 2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">The DG is the accounting unit for the whole customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out the comprehensive administration of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">The CS of the Czech Republic also carries out:</seg>
<seg id="838">(a) control:</seg>
<seg id="839">ശശ in the area of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of fees for the use of roads, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">ശശ management of waste and packaging material,</seg>
<seg id="841">ശശ safety of imported food,</seg>
<seg id="842">ശശ in the area of consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">ശശ employment of foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">(b) customs administration – it is a complex application of customs regulations, commercial policy measures and formalities in the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">(c) collection and recovery of cash payments imposed by other public administration bodies within the framework of the divided administration,</seg>
<seg id="846">d) activities of the police authority (authorized customs authorities) in proceedings on offences committed in breach of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">The scope of competences (concurrent control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, but there are cost savings of scale, as the public administration does not have to incur the expenses for the position of the control group for each subject of the inspection separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden of the audited persons is reduced by repeated inspection.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic furthermore exercises competence to verify compliance with obligations in the registration of sales from 1.12.2016 (§ 2 paragraph 2 of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the registration of sales) and from 1.1.2017 to supervise compliance with the law and conditions of operation of gambling including the imposition of sanctions (section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">As part of the Modernization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tier structure to a two-tier structure with effect from 1 January 2013, with the elimination of the central part of proceedings (Customs Directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">The DG has spent about CZK 51 million (i.e. about €2,031,000) on the project.</seg>
<seg id="852">EN The Czech Republic since 1 January 2013 consists of the DG and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competences are determined by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial offices.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial offices are internal organisational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to establish and abolish territorial offices and to determine their material competences by decree.</seg>
<seg id="856">The legislation does not stipulate any competences for territorial offices; territorial offices carry out the competences of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure until 31 December 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure since 1 January 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">The excise tax administration until 31.12.2012 was carried out by the DG, eight DCs and 58 departments of the CA (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 departments and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1.1.2016, the excise tax administration was carried out by the DG and 51 departments at the CA and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight workplaces of the legal department of the DG and the CA departments providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.</seg>
<seg id="861">The costs of the CA most significantly affect the wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">There were no savings in personnel resources as a result of the reorganisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="863">The main processes are carried out by customs officers in service under the Act on the service relationship of members of the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility to reduce the numbers of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, as according to the provisions of § 42 paragraph 1 of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service relationship of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from service only in cases exhaustively defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of service posts due to organizational changes in the security forces is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure that the members of the corresponding service posts within the force are assigned, or to secure service posts with other security forces (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise it will transfer them to the reserve for the temporarily non-attached, in which members of the security forces are entitled to 80% of the average service income according to the Act.</seg>

<seg id="867">Organizational organization of the administration of excise taxes in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="868">The Government of the Slovak Republic, within the framework of the program statement for the years 2012 to 2016, has set as one of the priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS program, which will secure additional budgetary resources by unification of the collection of taxes, duties and levies and suppression of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Tax Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Directorate into the Slovak Republic's Financial Directorate and the creation of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">The Slovak Tax Directorate was established on 1 January 2012 by Act No 333/2011 Coll., on state administration bodies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organization, which has its seat in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">The Slovak Tax Directorate, the CA and the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Coll., the Customs Act and on the amendment and supplementation of certain laws, as amended, are customs authorities if they perform tasks according to customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Act No 333/2011 Coll., on state administration bodies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, they together with the tax authorities form the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Competent Centre for Financial Operations, the tax authorities, the Tax Office for selected tax entities, tax office branches, tax office contact points, customs offices, branches of customs offices (branch of the Czech Tax Office, branch of the Czech Tax Office combined, branch of the Czech Customs Office) and customs office stations.</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of the Slovak Ministry of Finance is the effective collection and administration of taxes and duties, i.e. also excise duties, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of the Slovak Ministry of Finance is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore also for the activities of the Slovak Ministry of Finance, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organizational Structure of the Slovak Ministry since 1. 1. 2012 in abbreviated form</seg>
<seg id="878">Within all customs offices in the territory of the SR, activities and processes in the field of administration of excise taxes are ensured in addition to the branches of customs offices (38 branches) and customs office stations (18 stations) also by the excise tax department (9 departments) and the legal department (9 departments).</seg>

<seg id="882">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="883">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organizational structure of the financial administration of the SR, in 2015 in addition to the FR SR, 74 organizational departments with a total number of 1,300 employees dealt with administration of excise taxes; these departments administer nearly 48,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, in 2015, approximately 60 organizational departments with a total number of 1,011 employees dealt with administration of excise taxes, administering approximately 114,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of administration of excise taxes is divided among several personnel-independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their mutual coordination and cooperation is dealt with through middle and top management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In the Slovak Republic, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax inspection) in the area of administration of excise taxes is divided between the department of excise taxes and the branch of the customs office, within which the agenda is often dealt with by the same employees of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In the Slovak Republic, approximately one third of the number of tax entities per the total number of employees in the area of administration of excise taxes is compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the impact of the higher number of employees on the efficiency of the administration of excise taxes is not obvious.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on the transport and to carry out the prescribed checks, to simplify the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When introducing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, especially small and medium-sized enterprises active in this sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of the aforementioned EP and Council Decision allows the inclusion in the EMCS of a national specification, a national database forming part of the system and such technical or software as a Member State considers necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionalities of the EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which operated from May 2004 until the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1.4.2010 and is continuously supplemented with European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">In the Czech Republic, the so-called customs module and the declarant module have been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">Beyond the Community system, in the Czech Republic, EMCS monitors shipments under the conditional tax exemption regime both started and ended in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system provides for automatic transmission of information to the register of tax entities after approval of the notification of the receipt of a shipment intended for the authorised recipient for a one-off receipt, followed by the invalidation of the permit.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system provides for the administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including the sending of replies with an attachment in any format and the provision of translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a manual export termination message in the ECS (in the EU, only the forwarding of the automatically created message is implemented).</seg>
<seg id="906">The risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS system does not allow approval of e-AD or a notification of receipt without a response of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available free of charge for tax subjects, it takes the form of a web application into which the user logs in with a user name and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with the CS CR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Every action against the EMCS customs module must be provided with a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The declarant module allows tax subjects to directly enter data on started and finished shipments under the suspension regime, and thus tax subjects do not have to spend money on acquiring the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module allow data to be retrieved and stored off-line (saving time on frequently used data), to fill in data on the recipient based on the SEED ID check and to require the mandatory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for the real-time blocking of excise duty security for each shipment sent from the Czech Republic up to the time of the termination of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of security is calculated automatically by the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without a sufficient amount of security, it is not possible from the EMCS declarant module to send the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA of dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each guarantee has a unique number and contains the ARC of the transport (including the amount of the blocked security) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can administer its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the implementation and use of the EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of the EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight contracts with performance from 2006 to 2017 for a total amount of CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. €1,761,412.56) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">During the audited period, expenditure amounting to CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438.99) was spent on the upgrade of the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the upgrade of the EMCS during the audited period and converted into one transport entered into the EMCS is on average CZK 16.49 (i.e. €0.62), excluding national transport, this expenditure amounts to CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92) when converted into one transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="922">The technical support of the EMCS was carried out on the basis of four contracts with performance from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support was invoiced in the amount of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. €281,389.77) including value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport entered into the EMCS since 2010 is 6.18 CZK (i.e. 0.23 €).</seg>
<seg id="925">The invoices for both development and technical support related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which was already operated by the DG before EMCS itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were paid under the programme financing from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of deliveries of services to other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in SR</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor movements of excise goods between Member States under a duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document – SAD, which was used before the system took effect, thus ensuring better control and management of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="931">It has been introduced in the Slovak Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called ‘reference code’.</seg>
<seg id="933">The ARC code under which the traffic can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS provides for the receipt and dispatch of excise goods only by those taxable persons who are authorised to use the EMCS, thereby greatly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The greatest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the implementation and use of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of EMCS was implemented as an additional SysNeD application equipment module and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The aim of the EMCS was to replace a system based on paper-based transport administration.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefit of the EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between individual Member States within the EU from the notification of the start of transport to its termination – a significant reduction of administrative costs for tax administrators and tax subjects for processing, transmission and archiving of documents.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the EMCS system was introduced with a national functionality allowing monitoring of transport in a conditional system between two places in the Czech Republic and Slovakia respectively.</seg>
<seg id="944">In the Czech Republic, the automatic functionality of on-line monitoring and guaranteeing of the excise tax guarantee is also applied.</seg>
<seg id="945">The national functionality is also introduced, which monitors the risk of the tax entity or transport, followed by the obligatory reaction of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="946">The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of transport within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">Expenditure spent in the Slovak Republic on the upgrade of this system was however 744 310.01 € higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO SR obtained data on the upgrade of the EMCS system from the Slovak Republic only for the period from 2011, despite the fact that the system had been implemented and operated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Despite this, the expenditure spent on the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic was by 188,134.44 € higher than the expenditure on the introduction and upgrade of the EMCS system for approximately ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">During the audited period, the amount of expenditure related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in the Slovak Republic in terms of one transport was 2.3 times higher than the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic fulfilled the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax administration system in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of the excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">During parallel audits, examples of good practice were found that could contribute to the reduction of tax fraud, their importance will increase with increasing tax rates.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures reducing the costs of the excise tax administration were also identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons, unless mutually coordinated due diligence checks are carried out with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this, the role of supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel control of the value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration of 1977 stresses that supreme audit institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration asks that tax revenues be audited to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be one of the most important components of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The VIth EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenue carried out by the SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="7">An important step on the way to optimise the control activities of the SAIs is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This applies in particular to taxes as the most voluminous source of public revenue, which is most susceptible to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, the SAIs may to some extent be unable to carry out control activities without the cooperation of the SAIs of another state.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the revenues of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">To combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SAIs carrying out control in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea of carrying out a control of the administration of value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") and the VIES system was developed within the framework of the cooperation of the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">This was followed by careful preparation, where both parties first had to get acquainted with the legal environment and procedures for the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of audit topics was made, which were included in the audit programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving an effective and efficient administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual states (especially the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel audits of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Audit subject:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Value added tax administration after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Audit objective:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the audit operation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the Czech Republic's integration into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the EU) connected with the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to exemption from value added tax for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">System of exchange of information on value added tax The audited operations were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two auditing institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected commercial transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “the Czech Republic”) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as “Germany”), the use of information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the auditing operations was prepared in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI auditing standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel auditing operations</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audit in the field of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from the main point – the exchange of information on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1925/2004 – the audit covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and summary reports, which are closely connected with the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition, the control included the legal situation in the field of international bus passenger transport and a comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">Comparison of the VAT administration systems of the two countries revealed differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered irrespective of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany, payers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If a German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus passenger transport is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, part of the transport that takes place on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">At EU level, efforts should be made to harmonise the situation in the sense of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic, tax payers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany, tax payers are obliged to file so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year, they have to file annual VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike in the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany are obliged to file preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of an obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic, tax payers file summary reports at the tax offices, in the Czech Republic, tax payers file summary reports at the Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="53">The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have the data from the summary reports available immediately after they have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="54">The German tax authorities have the information from the summary reports available only after they have been processed into the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires that updated information on intra-community transactions is available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">Monthly submission of the summary reports would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the updating of the data in the VIES.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would in turn allow for a timely verification of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">This would, however, require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submission of the summary report.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for received requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not monitor the elapsed time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result, the German tax administration handled a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Due to these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent alert (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of the two Member States develops its own risk management system (RMS), which has both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, components and approaches of RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of the cooperation, the two SAIs examined selected cases of intra-community transactions, carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Together, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their completion or suspicion of VAT evasion were examined using the legislation for the Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used the information obtained through international cooperation to assess the VAT liability of the payers.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers either improperly claimed the VAT exemption of the supply or failed to declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Cases have been identified where payers have erroneously reported commercial transactions in recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in the VIES were incorrect and the tax administrations had to check these cases (see 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">Progress of control action</seg>
<seg id="79">Progress of the audit operation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the State Budget Revenue Department and the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as the “MoF”) and 10 financial offices – the Financial Office in Humpolec, the Financial Office in Jihlava, the Financial Office in Kadani, the Financial Office in Liberec, the Financial Office in Nymburk, the Financial Office in Otrokovice, the Financial Office for Prague 1, the Financial Office for Prague 4, the Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The audit conclusion from this audit operation was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Audit operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Tax Audit Group and by the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The audit was part of the 2006 audit plan and was therefore reported to the Federal MoF in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the testing phase, the audit was launched in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH had to notify a number of federal states of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance and at the CLO, the auditing operation was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files of the following tax authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for corporations/legal entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Centre (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-North), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn Centre (Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne Centre (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne South (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen (Bautzen), Chemnitz South (Chemnitz-Süd), Dresden II (Dresden II), Freiberg, Leipzig I (Leipzig I) and Zschopau.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, discussions were held with the Tax Office Augsburg-City (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old Town (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation of the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">In preparation of the parallel audit actions, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions took place in the period prior to their start.</seg>
<seg id="96">The participants of these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, the VAT legislation and the VAT administration system in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the topics of the testing phase were agreed.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the testing phase were evaluated at a further joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">During this meeting, a timetable for the further progress of the work was agreed and the following topics of the parallel controls were set:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. VAT registration of payers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus transport of persons - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators when processing requests for information and examining selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical data on supplies and acquisitions of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two parties got acquainted with the progress of the audits in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="111">A report on the results of parallel audits of VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Value added tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Taxpayers having their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees (hereinafter “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”), a taxpayer, taxpayer and legal successor of a natural or legal person, which is defined as a tax entity by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax subjects were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">As of 1 December 2005, the number of tax subjects registered for VAT increased to 457,590.</seg>
<seg id="118">A taxable person having his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 preceding consecutive calendar months, becomes a taxpayer from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Section 94, subsection 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).</seg>
<seg id="119">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow to register a taxable person so-called retrospectively in cases where the reason for registration is exceeding the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to deduct may become a taxable person even if he does not exceed the turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) if he fulfils any of the other conditions set out in Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out by the Act may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">By delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator, the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="124">A voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on the application for VAT registration the date on which he or she applies for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator shall check the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he or she has doubts about the stated data, he or she shall ask the tax entity to explain, complete or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">After the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity fulfils the conditions for registration, he or she shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Identification Number).</seg>
<seg id="128">On the certificate, the tax administrator shall indicate the effective date of the registration for VAT and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period shall be the calendar quarter if the turnover of the payer for the previous calendar year has not reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the turnover of the payer for the previous calendar year has reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax period shall be the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">A payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year has reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) shall be entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the TIN in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the tax entity is obliged to state it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The TIN contains the code "CZ" and the ordinary part, which consists of a general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier is the birth number for a natural person, or another general identifier if a special law so provides, and the identification number for a legal person (Section 33, subsection 12 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If a tax entity has not fulfilled its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, the locally competent tax administrator registers it automatically.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issuance of the Certificate of Registration ex officio, which is delivered to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that has obtained a business license is allocated the TIN at the moment of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same TIN is used by the taxpayer even if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1 January 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may impose compensation of up to 10% of the total revenue or income for taxable transactions, which this person carried out without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been a registered payer by law to the date on which he became a registered payer by decision of the tax administrator (provision § 98 paragraph 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of the amount thus determined is considered as a tax payment (section 98 paragraph 3 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">The cancellation of the registration of a VAT payer when fulfilling the conditions laid down by law is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">The cancellation of the registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover, which does not reach the registration limit (section 106 paragraph 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer is entitled to apply for the cancellation of the registration at the earliest after the expiration of 1 year from the effective date stated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) The cancellation of the registration "ex officio" (Section106(7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.) if: a) the payer has not performed the performance for 12 consecutive months without notifying the tax administrator of the reason, b) the payer has not fulfilled his obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who carries out a performance with a place of performance in the Czech Republic and is a person obliged to declare and pay tax on this performance pursuant to Section 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called "non-established payer"), becomes a payer on the day of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to submit the application for registration to the Financial Office for Prague 1 no later than the date of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the application for registration, he is obliged to state all the VAT numbers allocated to him in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a "non-established" taxpayer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 registers him retroactively, because according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the case of retroactive registration, the Financial Office for Prague 1 requires from tax entities proof that the performance has been performed (invoices, or explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a "non-established" taxpayer applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable performance takes place, the Financial Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts that the performance will take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">At the Financial Office for Prague 1, 473 "non-established" taxpayers were registered as of 31 December 2004, of which 124 were from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005, 951 "non-established" taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Act No 235/2004, the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a "non-established" taxpayer as of 31 January of the following calendar year if the tax payer did not incur any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SAO audit found that if a "non-established" taxpayer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the statutory regulation at the deadline for filing the tax return, the tax office often does not have it available yet on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration are known to the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the VAT registration of a "non-established" taxpayer in the Czech Republic in the given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxpayers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as "AO"), anyone who carries out business activities is obliged to inform the city/municipal office or the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the municipal/municipal authority for the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax authority identifies an enterprise that has started the business but has not registered, the relevant tax authority can register this payer ex officio – and retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-residents in Germany are obliged by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (hereinafter "UStG").</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they realise.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax authorities for entrepreneurs permanently resident abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those who have their registered office in the Czech Republic, the relevant tax authority is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd tax authority; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">The BRH found that these special tax offices often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the work permits of employees from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These businesses do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Section 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single employer who determines their working hours and the way in which they carry out their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the relevant tax office, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities he carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either by special departments of the tax offices or by departments with a general focus, which are responsible for assessing taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">The risk assessment of individual taxpayers is carried out through this form before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the next three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are for distinguishing the payers, with the last always being a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-community trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intra-community supply.</seg>
<seg id="178">The CLO assigns a VAT ID at the entrepreneur's request, if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="179">The CLO assigns a VAT ID automatically to the entrepreneur when the payers include an intra-community supply in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">The trader's registration can be cancelled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activity), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all business years), and 2. if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in business activity.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the validity of the VAT identification number.</seg>
<seg id="184">Under the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT if 1. the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. the following year is not likely to exceed EUR 50 000.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called small traders ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other traders for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not liable to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur can declare that he will not apply the provisions of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This return is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For non-residents, there is the possibility to appoint tax representatives (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">A prerequisite is that they carry out exclusively tax-exempt business operations and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who is thus not required to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered irrespective of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among others) for registration is exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If a tax subject in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit set, he or she has the possibility to apply for VAT registration on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but differences may occur due to different organizational models in federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the tax payer is assigned a VAT number at the moment of his or her first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he or she uses the same VAT number for intra-community transactions as well.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, the tax payer is assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If a German payer intends to carry out intra-community transactions, he or she must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and BRH have found, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as in the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax office about their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows for a correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax period, especially an accurate estimation of VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different registration methods cause problems, the conditions should be balanced across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter the Tax Identification Number).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Tax Office will assign the Tax Identification Number at the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This Tax Identification Number will be valid for the whole life of a natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will apply for an economic Tax Identification Number, which will be used as the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the assignment of the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on the introduction of the IT means to administer the Tax Identification Number has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International Bus Transport of Persons</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of passengers between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="216">This transport is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by entrepreneurs who are registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">The return transport is considered to be a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If "non-established" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out any other economic activity apart from international bus transport of passengers, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport has been exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic pursuant to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5, paragraph 1 (b), which states:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purposes of Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt from value added tax international passenger transport pursuant to point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition set out in Article 28(4) of the Directive is fulfilled or the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier."</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of the legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Article 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of provision of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place) where the transport takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between domestic and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the route that takes place in Germany constitutes the taxable supply of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident transports passengers through Germany, the part of the route that takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable supply of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">A non-resident must declare his intention to provide passenger transport to the relevant tax office before carrying out his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office registers this non-resident for tax purposes (cf. 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is mentioned in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable transport services in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd tax office registered 741 Czech taxpayers who carried out passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="231">If passenger transport is provided to a resident taxpayer who is subject to VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the tax office himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity liable to pay the VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is the resident taxpayer who receives the services; this process is known as the reverse charge and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return, the German tax administration has several means to assess the correctness of the declared taxable passenger transport supplies.</seg>
<seg id="234">The customs office's mobile control groups audit the certificates of buses licensed (licensed) for foreign transport, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, the mobile control groups send a control report to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to claim the payment of VAT from the bus driver before continuing with the next transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may declare its intention to carry out an audit, which must be carried out in the office of the tax office, or it may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">If a review of the VAT return or the non-resident's compliance is to be carried out, the BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable passenger transport services.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the non-resident's accounts entails disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration has to carry out an audit of foreign accounts, which means not only the need for knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, but this audit is limited to those passenger transport services carried out in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident taxpayer may not only accept the right to carry out an audit, which is the responsibility of his national tax administration, but also the right to have an audit carried out by other Member States in which he transports passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">Moreover, in any Member State in which only one passenger transport service is carried out, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all tax obligations applicable to him in those Member States, in all languages and on all tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between individual EU Member States, or between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct tax under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">If this transport is provided in Germany for the first time by an non-established taxpayer, he is obliged to give prior notification of the provision of the transport to the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this taxpayer and the taxpayer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable provision of part of the transport in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">The implementation of the Act is very time-consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office operate in passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the given effort, the tax revenue, if realised, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States that collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate costs for charging VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed only in one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider resides.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require modification of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if he has not incurred any tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is due within the deadline for filing a VAT return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the importation of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., where the tax due is determined by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a refundable overpayment arises as a result of the assessment of the excess deduction, it shall be returned to the payer without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings concerning the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of Section 73, subsection 11 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct tax can be exercised in the regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct tax could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">After the expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct tax can be further exercised within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct tax could be exercised at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible in the form of filing a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">The amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, allows filing a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct tax could be exercised for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The taxpayer is obliged to submit a supplementary VAT return if (a) the summary of corrections increases the tax liability, (b) the correction does not change the last known tax liability, but only data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) the correction of the rate and amount of tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The taxpayer may submit a supplementary VAT return if the summary of corrections reduces the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer is obliged to submit a supplementary VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The filing of a VAT return in electronic form can be done either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">The filing over the Internet can be done as a filing with a data message accompanied by a guaranteed electronic signature or as a filing with a data message not accompanied by a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of a submission with a data message not bearing an advanced electronic signature, the submission in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer set to the tax administrator (e-form) is still required.</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-Community supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">The values of acquisitions of services are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of the initial automated check under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The values of supplies of goods to persons registered for tax in other Member States are compared with the data provided in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of acquisitions of goods from other Member States from persons registered for tax in other Member States are compared with the values obtained through the VIES system from the recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">A credibility test of VAT returns is carried out at the tax office under the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test is carried out automatically, since without the test the VAT returns cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test involves the calculation of the credibility criteria and the evaluation of the risk types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No 337/1992, the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who fails to comply within the prescribed period with an obligation of a non-monetary nature arising from this or a special tax law or imposed by a decision under this law.</seg>
<seg id="285">An automated tax information system, which is used by the tax offices to provide technical support to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit revealed that the tax authorities did not generally use the possibility to impose a fine on taxpayers for failing to file a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit preliminary VAT returns still have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not required to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">Generally, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which the VAT is incurred (§18(2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year, or if it is a newly established business, the relevant entrepreneur is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to submit a monthly VAT return if a tax refund exceeding EUR 6 136 was made in the previous year (§18(2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns do not have to be submitted if the annual VAT amount does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no time limits (according to the law) for processing tax returns and refunding excess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to obtain a timely refund, it is possible to offer security for the amount to be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to prepare VAT returns and return the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT Act provides for the possibility of extending this time limit (section 18(6) of the UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension must be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows the VAT return to be submitted and the relevant VAT liability to be paid a month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the trader must file a corrected VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be submitted by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered at the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct the incorrect preliminary VAT return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">The correction of the annual VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the payer is possible during the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The payers are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid excessive hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">The submission of the annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is made without certification, the payer must submit the return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">In case the payer fails to submit the VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In case of late submission, a penalty payment (a maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000) may be imposed on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="315">During the previous inspection, the BRH found that the tax authorities often do not assess this standard penalty.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities have imposed a penalty, the amount has been assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard penalty therefore fails to meet its objective of shortening the average delay, especially when filing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intra-community supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">The values of acquisitions of services are reported on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns that are submitted in paper form, a copy must be made either via a scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from the VAT returns submitted electronically is immediately available to the tax office staff.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data are entered into the system, the RMS staff goes through them and makes a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">Selected VAT returns must be rechecked by the tax office staff on the basis of a control report prepared by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration has to make a rough estimate of the amount of VAT that the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers submit VAT returns within 25 days of the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">The tax period is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month, depending on the amount of the payer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers file their preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or the month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May of the following year, payers are obliged to file their annual tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to file their annual VAT returns has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in the (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if the payer corrects the declared intra-community transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative report is filed;</seg>
<seg id="335">– federal states usually do not compare VIES data on intra-community acquisitions of German payers before the annual VAT return is processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">According to the registration (see section 4.1.3), German payers are obliged to file their annual VAT returns independently of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German tax authority to verify the maximum turnover limit for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT returns with the direct tax returns and with the final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax authorities are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from the submitted income tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike in the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of an obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">The summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH") is submitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. by a payer who has made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the goods supplied are always presented in Czech currency, broken down by individual tax subjects, indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services provided are not included in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">The SH is submitted by payers with monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="348">Correction of erroneous data is carried out in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">The erroneous data stated in the SH are always replaced by the data stated in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">In the same way as tax returns, payers can file the SH in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">In case the payer does not file the SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed it according to Act No.235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator will invite him to file it and at the same time inform him about the consequences in case of non-filing of the SH or the subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax administrator is entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for non-pecuniary failures.</seg>
<seg id="352">The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities did not usually use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for non-compliance with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of filing the SH, tax subjects are not sufficiently motivated to comply with their obligations, because the non-filing of the SH does not affect the VAT tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged under Section 102(5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. to verify the data in the SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and to use the data for determining the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of non-compliance of the data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payer with a monthly tax period) or the relevant (payer with a quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administrator should verify the correctness of the declared tax liability stated in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The tax entity removes the erroneous data in the SH by filing the subsequent SH itself, or it may be requested to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator corrects the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system in case:</seg>
<seg id="358">– the payer does not prove the data stated in the SH (or the subsequent SH) and corrects them by filing the subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax administrator proves that the data stated by the payer in the SH or the subsequent SH are not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator, by inserting a correction without filing a subsequent SH by the payer, does not replace the submission of the tax entity, only modifies the data in the VIES database so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">The data from the SH are sent to the respective Member States.</seg>
<seg id="362">It can be sent and received only by a national financial administration authority designated for cooperation with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is fulfilled by the Ministry of Finance, Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="363">The O_MCTL is an automatic message that the CLO receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs listed in the dispatched lines of the SH.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the erroneous VAT ID is used in any of the transmitted normal lines of the SH or a subsequent SH, an entry is made in the table of erroneous VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "Doubt Notice on the VAT ID".</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator checks the data and records the result of the verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare the VAT and indicate the acquisition values on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of irregularities in the value of the acquired goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return and in the value of the delivered goods as declared by the payers from other Member States in their SH are sent from the Customs Office to the tax office for verification.</seg>
<seg id="370">The tax administrators are obliged to investigate the irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three situations can occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the delivery declared by the EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator checks the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The amount of the difference is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects his SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself files an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is up to the tax administrator to verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return despite this fact.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of acquisitions of goods from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer stated in the relevant rows of the VAT return, is higher than the value of supplied goods declared to the EU taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here too, it is at the discretion of the administration whether it will verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After verifying the difference and explaining the causes of its occurrence, the tax administration will enter the result of the verification in the ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the verification are transmitted back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The numbers of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for verification for each quarter of 2005 are shown in Chart 1 (NB: source: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">The above chart 1 shows that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities for each quarter of 2005 was decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="383">The number significantly decreased for the fourth quarter of 2005. The CLO increased the minimum financial limit, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between the data from the VAT returns and the data from the EU may not always be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error due to the fact that in individual EU Member States certain types of transactions may be reported in the SH in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions found at audited financial offices are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or are involved in triangular transactions are obliged to submit quarterly SHs listing intra-Community deliveries by recipients (Section 18a(1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The SH must be submitted by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this deadline is allowed in the case of preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">The SH must be delivered to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">From 1 January 2007, they must be submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exceptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realise that the SH contains incorrect data, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers fail to submit the SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to compel the submission of this report.</seg>
<seg id="396">This procedure includes: – a first reminder – a second reminder linked to the threat of a fine/periodic penalty payment, and – the assessment of periodic penalty payments.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows fines of up to EUR 25 000 to be imposed (Section 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, Paragraph 26a(1) No 5 UStG provides that payers act unlawfully if they intentionally or negligently fail to file the SH properly, file it incomplete, file it on time or if they fail to correct or correct the SH at all.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punished by a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office, as the processing of the SH is the sole task of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">The SH data are only stored in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">The SH data are therefore only visually available to the tax office after they have been processed into the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for the processing of the SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Data from the SH must be stored within three months following the calendar quarter in question.</seg>
<seg id="405">If incorrect VAT IDs are entered in the SH of German payers, the CLO receives O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO contacts a particular trader and asks him for the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case is forwarded to the relevant tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax offices to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the inspection, the BRH found that most traders had corrected the VAT ID at the request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the challenge, the threat and the imposition of three additional fines take up too much time in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The tax authority rejected the exemption of declared intra-community supplies in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax authority asked him to submit the corrected SH to the CLO, as the tax authorities cannot correct the VIES data themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the filing of the corrected SH, so often the payers did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, a comparison of the delivery data declared in the VAT return and in the SH does not take place before the submission of these data to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied when preparing the VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States are processed into the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and then submitted to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">These data are used for the purpose of the control of acquisition by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once entered into the system, the CLO checks them on the basis of a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">In case they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), the control information is created and sent to the respective tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure subsequently checks these data with data on intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have made a supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State submit the SH within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities process the SH and transmit the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, indicated by the payers in the SH, are compared at the tax authorities with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State, indicated by these payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who have made intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit the SH quarterly by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">The SH is submitted by the payers to the CLO, since 1 January 2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities have the information from the SH only after it has been processed into the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">The payers from both the Czech Republic and Germany list only the supply of goods in the SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the wrong lines submitted by the SH themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to the German VIES data, the wrong VAT ID was not corrected, even though the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FÚ.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the data on intra-Community supplies that are included in the VAT return of the German payer and his SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of these two statements are usually not detected before the German CLO provides the data from VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Given the BRH's findings, it is clear that a comparison would increase the reliability of the transmitted data in VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on supplies of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on acquisitions of goods from other Member States declared by the Czech payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison is carried out by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are transmitted to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the tax returns of payers.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">In addition, the German tax administration only checks the taxation of intra-community acquisitions of other taxpayers if the RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is designated for the check anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities from having to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Combating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intra-community acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay can be reduced by up to four months if payers file the SH monthly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs as most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file VAT tax returns monthly – and the SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">To avoid bureaucratic costs, filing the SH monthly may be associated with filing a VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to file the SH on a monthly basis would cause more time mismatches between the reporting of intra-Community delivery and intra-Community acquisition and could increase the flow of data between the various CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="453">The German federal government considered the general provision of the monthly SH in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed due to doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that the monthly submission of data from VIES to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the monthly reporting obligation of the SH and the monthly data transmission were to be effective, the monthly update of the VIES system would require a European monthly SH standard.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical data on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In the context of foreign trade, the SRN represents the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intra-Community transactions in goods, carried out between the Czech Republic and Germany, are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous TINs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason for these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-Community commercial transactions and the payers who carried out these transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information upon request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">The international exchange of information upon request takes the form of so-called requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "RUs"), using the SCAC standardized forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax authorities from the Czech Republic send their RUs or replies to the received RUs through the Financial Directorates to the Customs Office, which ensures the translation of the information provided on the SCAC standardized forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The Customs Office also ensures the receipt of RUs from other Member States and replies to the dispatched RUs, their translation into Czech and their distribution to the locally competent tax authorities for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets the maximum time limit for processing RUs at 3 months from the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO audited all the RUs submitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total number of 94 RUs received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the stipulated three-month time limit, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this time limit and for the remaining 1 case no reply was sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">Chart 2 contains more detailed information on the time limits within which replies to RUs received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="476">Out of the total number of 335 RUs sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the stipulated three-month time limit, another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) received a reply after this time limit and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) did not receive a reply from Germany by the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine when the reply from Germany was received from Germany from the submitted data).</seg>
<seg id="477">Chart 3 contains more detailed information on the time limits within which replies to RUs sent to Germany were received to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="478">Figure 4 provides a percentage of the values of intra-community transactions reported in the RU transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the above chart, the value of commercial transactions examined through the RU was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">International exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax administrators from other Member States are often forwarded information that may be relevant for them in the administration of VAT without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is transmitted electronically between individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals, according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax authorities from the form Reporting on the delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">The tax authorities fill in the necessary data in a specially created template during the processing of the aforementioned form and transmit it by return to a contact person at the Financial Directorate where the data are collected and within a specified period, i.e. no later than two months from the end of the quarter in which the information was available, transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="489">Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU transactions which appear to be unauthorised and information on potential missing traders.</seg>
<seg id="490">The information is sent to other Member States in the form of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementing the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by email directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to foreign CLOs.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities have been instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information, controlled by the BRH, have been sent in order to ensure that intra-Community acquisitions are taxed in another Member State, or to prove that intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State are exempt from tax.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check the value of the supplies of goods or services specified in the request for a minimum threshold of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no reasonable reason for this request, the German CLO will reject any request containing an amount below this threshold.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the request for information, the CLO sends the request to the relevant tax authority, referring to the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no further deadlines for processing requests at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past deadlines, it lacks sufficient staffing capacities to alert the tax authorities to answering blank requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two different types of audit: a special VAT audit, which covers any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only cover a single business transaction that has been carried out recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and ﬂexible type of audit requires no notification to the taxpayer and has proven its usefulness in investigating individual taxable business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="505">In an automatic exchange without prior request, the FRG provides other Member States with information – on VAT IDs allocated to payers who are resident in other Member States, – on the refund of input tax to payers who are resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">In addition, the FRG has undertaken to provide other Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. dispatch or catalogue sale in other Member States which is not taxable in the FRG, c. significant differences between intra-Community acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intra-Community delivery of goods which the German payer did not declare in the SH because it treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "missing trader" who carried out intra-Community transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or to those recipients who misused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The dispatch of the RU or spontaneous information is initiated by the local tax authorities both in the Czech Republic and in the FRG, who send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech – English) and translates the sent information into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the instruction to write RUs or spontaneous information only in German on the monolingual form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide for the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">Examination of RUs submitted between 1.5.2004 and 31.12.2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany revealed that the Czech tax administration handled 74.5% of received applications within the three-month deadline, while RUs sent to Germany were handled by the German tax administration within the three-month deadline in only 40.6% of cases.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO alerts the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not keep track of the elapsed time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of the missing alerts is a large number of delayed replies to the RUs.</seg>
<seg id="515">Because of these problems, the BRH recommended regular alerts to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, the German CLO now alerts the tax authorities to replies to the incomplete replies to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, VAT risk management is dealt with by several departments at various organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the Ministry of Finance, the following departments deal with the issues of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The Methodology and VAT performance department and within it the VAT risk management department, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at both the domestic and Community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">It coordinates the functioning of the role of the Trust of VAT tax returns and the use of data from the VIES system nationwide in terms of the risks of tax evasion in the framework of intra-community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, processes the conceptual VAT risk management and cooperates in this area with the relevant EU institutions and with other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT, which inter alia ensures the exchange of information in the field of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides information to the public and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">The reason for these differences may be the different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, the German CLO refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Tax Control and Search Methodology department, which, among other things, carries out risk analysis in the framework of the methodological management of tax controls and, in accordance with risk analysis, sets priorities for the targeting of tax controls in the plans of the financial directorates, processes risk analyses in the framework of the reduction of tax evasion, including the gathering of knowledge gained from the administration of taxes as well as from other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Search departments are established in the financial directorates, which carry out, among other things, searches of tax entities and areas that are risky in terms of occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches of unregistered tax entities in terms of risks of tax evasion (e.g. in the field of internet services, job placement, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of links of chain fraud and transmission of information to the territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialised control departments are established in the selected 12 financial offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence and carry out tax controls outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of mandates.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up specialised tax control units has emerged from the increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which are mainly found in entities linked to chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">These units focus on checking tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax entities with a large scale of activity in terms of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms have been integrated into the ADIS system to limit VAT risks: – role Credibility of VAT tax returns, used to evaluate the risk of tax returns submitted; – role Selection of tax entities for inspection, allowing the selection of the payer for inspection on the basis of selected criteria; – role of VIES, through which tax administrators have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES allows, among other things: – to check the validity of VAT IDs of payers from other Member States; – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States; – to generate a report of payers who did not submit SH; – to carry out a formal check of the data provided by payers from the Czech Republic in SH before sending these data to other Member States; – to generate a report of payers for whom the data on supplies of goods to other Member States stated in VAT returns do not match the data in SH; – to generate a report of payers for whom the value of acquisitions of goods from other Member States stated in VAT returns does not match the data declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of their activity to limit the risk of tax evasion, tax authorities have access to registers of state government bodies such as the Commercial Register, the Real Estate Register, the Register of Motor Vehicles, the Register of Trade, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Due to the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the Federal Tax Administration (in particular the CLO) and the Tax Administrations of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the Tax Administrations of the federal states share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as ‘KUSS’ – Coordination Unit for Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigations) collects audit findings concerning tax fraud in a special database called OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has introduced a new database called ZAUBER for the transfer of names of companies of tax fraudsters ‘missing traders’.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of the RMS in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, the specialists of several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with the duties and powers associated with RMS.</seg>
<seg id="549">At CLO level, a formal check of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in the SH filed by German payers is introduced.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out before the data from the SH are provided to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The verification of the validity of VAT IDs listed in the SH is carried out on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure of correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS on the CLO is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually figure in so-called carousel trading operations, in order to identify potential ‘missing traders’.</seg>
<seg id="553">The Federal Tax Authorities are instructed to process these control reports and, in some cases, to report on the results of their findings to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The BRH audit findings confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all the available characteristics if a case of tax fraud is to be assumed with sufficient probability (instead of focusing solely on company turnover).</seg>
<seg id="555">The BRH therefore suggested to the MF that different characteristics should be taken into account when processing the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should also cover other elements, such as the payment behaviour (morality) of the taxpayer, the field (economic activities) or the shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of the RMS is processed in the Federal Tax Administrations and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, the RMS generates a list of those payers who have declared intra-community supplies in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intra-community acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with data from the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder try to avoid comparing quarterly data because this comparison would reveal too much disapproving data that is attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">– different execution times of the intra-community transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">– different accounting for sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing data from VAT returns and the VIES system, many Länder have introduced elements of the RMS that are based on data from VAT returns and some other elements (such as company name structure, shareholder age, number of employees and payment behaviour/morality of the taxpayer).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a rule-based RMS which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter risk managers) to programme their own rules for singling out potential tax fraud offenders.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="567">The relevant tax authority therefore receives a recommendation made by the RMS before determining the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this RMS is not able to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers have to adjust the relevant rules based on feedback from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania district has programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data from tax files in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on this data, the RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The RMS produces a monthly list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for deciding on the audit of proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit, auditors have to report their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The administrative region of North Rhine-Westphalia uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or data-mining system calculates the probability that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of potential fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">The local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for the audit and report the findings of the audit to the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of any of these three RMS in the other Länder is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">As none of these three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as the different approaches in the three Länder of Germany, the RMS of each EU State has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">New trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud are currently being discussed by the tax authorities of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - is not proving to be a national problem, but rather a European one.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in more than one.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components and approaches of RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">A VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State that is involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected audit findings during verification of commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">As part of the cooperation on the implementation of parallel audit actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected commercial transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">Furthermore, the two audit institutions jointly examined the implementation of several commercial transactions, where there were doubts about their completion, or irregularities in the way the tax payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT returns, respectively SH.</seg>
<seg id="595">The SAO scrutinized a total of 8 cases, which related to commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities, at BRH's request.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, the SAO scrutinized in 43 cases, based on BRH's notification, the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which the Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH.</seg>
<seg id="597">The BRH scrutinized a total of 23 cases, which related to commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities, at the SAO's request.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 through official communication with CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">Examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different way of registration in the EU member states leads to problems mentioned in chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 60,500 from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="602">As the Czech payer only reported the acquisition of goods worth EUR 29,869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Federal Republic for verification of the value of the delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">In a reply to the RU received from Germany, the German side stated that the German payer had delivered goods worth EUR 27,381 to the Czech payer in the second quarter of 2004, EUR 31,997 in the third quarter and EUR 10,276 in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply also showed that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28 September 2004, but the German Customs in 2006 issued a VAT ID validity certificate retroactively from 1 May 2004 based on the additional request of the German payer for a VAT ID validity certificate.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer made a correction to the SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">The Czech payer based on this information was concerned with the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that the Czech payer submitted additional VAT returns for individual tax periods of 2004, in which he increased the value of goods purchased from other Member States and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax authority could not clearly determine whether the values of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier were included.</seg>
<seg id="609">The BRH found out that the German supplier had been registered for VAT in September 2003, based on the SAO's request.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID when registering, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is usually not possible to allocate a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case the German tax official in 2006 allocated a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004 to the above-mentioned German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German Customs Office allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause a delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay was caused by the Customs Office after the payer's application for a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, the Customs Office allocates a VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intra-community supplies pursuant to Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other hand, the German recipient does not need his supplier's valid VAT ID in order to declare intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these different procedures between Member States, the German Customs Office allocated the VAT ID retroactively in this special case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Czech tax administrator requested verification of the German payer's VAT registration as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="618">The VIES indicated the date of registration as March 5, 2005, while the German payer's registration certificate issued by the competent German tax office indicated the date as October 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In the reply received from the German tax office, the German party stated that the German tax entity had been registered since October 1, 2004, but the VAT ID had not been provided to it in Germany until February 16, 2005, for organizational reasons.</seg>
<seg id="620">The SAO, by enquiry with the local tax administrator, found that the Czech tax administrator had performed a VAT check on the Czech payer for the tax period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">The audit revealed that the Czech taxpayer had included in the VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) provided to the German taxpayer in the period before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For the tax period from the third quarter of 2004, the Tax Office assessed the taxpayer VAT amounting to CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">The BRH found out, based on the SAO's request, that the German taxpayer had been allocated the VAT ID only on 16 February 2005 when it informed the Tax Office about its business, which it had started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the Tax Office registered him for VAT retrospectively as of 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return, the payer reported intra-community acquisition from the Czech Republic amounting to EUR 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech taxpayer reported in the VAT return for September 2004 and in the SH for the third quarter of 2004 the delivery of goods amounting to CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="627">When verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that its registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. only after the delivery of goods by the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer submitted an additional VAT DAP, in which it declared the tax base of the effected transactions in the Czech Republic worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT in the amount of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which it paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO found that the Czech payer subsequently filed an application for a renewal of the proceedings concerning the additional VAT return and as evidence submitted a confirmation by the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from the German tax administration showed that the German payer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of the delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for a renewal of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that the case did not involve an intra-Community acquisition of the goods, as the German payer only obtained a VAT ID on 11 November 2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German payee declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and declared the VAT on this acquisition when he requested the refund of the input tax in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, since there would have been no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">BRH also found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in the RU, was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">In the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of the goods by the Czech payer in the 1st quarter of 2005 in the value of EUR 22 686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">The SAO inquired with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic and found that the administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, during which he verified that the delivery of goods had taken place and the Czech payer had accounted for and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not declare the acquisition of goods in the VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number designated for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer had been registered for VAT for intra-community transactions only from 21.4.2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the German payer's registration certificate, so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech tax office assessed the commercial transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer in Germany, and therefore did not subsequently charge the Czech payer the tax on the commercial transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not need to have a VAT ID in order for the intra-Community supply of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier only needs to have a VAT ID of the purchaser from another Member State and must be able to prove that the goods have been transported to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT law, the transaction was therefore an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be charged in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed the transaction because the delivery of the machine at the specified value was not the German supplier's core business.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to answer the RUs, which relate to intra-Community transactions with a value of less than EUR 15 000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax check on the tax entity for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of the international administrative cooperation, it asked the German tax administration to verify the delivery of these goods using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods had not been accounted for in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the request to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, on the grounds that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory reasons were given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax administration did not obtain evidence to assess the tax on the acquired goods, it terminated the tax audit without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">BRH, based on the request of the SAO, found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (§ 22 a – e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer declared the mentioned supplies in its annual VAT return and in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was entitled to the exemption of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the BRH's warning, the German tax office sends to the Czech Republic the documents needed for the assessment of the tax on the acquired goods in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the RU sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the stipulated three-month deadline more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO found that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5 October 2005 concerning the verification of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer declared in the SH for this period the delivery of goods to the Czech payer amounting to EUR 86 307, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only amounting to EUR 35 314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the reply to the RU, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for the processing stipulated in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request could not be processed as the German company's operations were terminated at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">As the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RU, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for the tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, the Czech tax administration applied through the SCAC form for the verification of the deliveries of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German tax payer, made in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that no reply to the RU had been received from the Federal Republic of Germany by the time of the verification.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also found that the Czech tax payer had not included in the VAT return the deliveries of new means of transport for the German tax payer in the amount of CZK 11 816 103 (EUR 375 472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administration corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity submitted the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">Based on the request of the SAO, the BRH found that the German customs office had not transmitted the aforementioned RU to the local tax office for verification due to technical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="670">After the BRH was notified, an inspection was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany, during which it was found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the respective cars had been sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to the VIES data, the Czech payer should have purchased a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="672">The acquisition of these goods was not declared by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="673">When questioned by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after the requests of the tax administrator, so on 23 May 2005 the tax office charged him VAT amounting to CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005 the Customs Office pointed out the aforementioned delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the ŽOI to Germany regarding the aforementioned delivery.</seg>
<seg id="677">As the response to the RU was not received in the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained from the international exchange until the completion of the audit by the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tax office cancelled the VAT registration of the Czech payer as of 23 August 2005 due to the failure to comply with the obligations arising from the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial reply was sent to the RU because the audit performed by the tax authorities on the payers was not completed at the time of the audit by the SAO and the BRH:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax administrator applied through the SCAC form for the verification of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16,991 to the German payer, made in the third quarter of 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the reply to the RU, the German tax administrator stated that he only had the invoice issued by the Czech payer for the delivery worth EUR 16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">The BRH, based on the request of the SAO, found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. The Czech tax administrator requested in 2005, through the SCAC form, the verification of the delivery of cars to the German payer worth EUR 198 167, carried out in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent to the Czech Republic a partial reply to the IRS, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by the German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that the locally competent tax office carried out several local investigations at the Czech supplier in order to verify the drawdown of excess VAT deductions, during which it did not detect their unjustified drawdown.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that the German payer had declared in its VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 and that the control carried out by the German tax office at the acquirer from Germany had not been completed yet.</seg>
<seg id="690">In chapter 4.4.1, the reasons for the differences between the values of the intra-Community acquisition of goods declared by the recipient in the tax return and the values stated by the supplier in its SH are described.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not the time difference or the incorrect value of the intra-Community delivery of goods in the SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">The Czech payer should have purchased goods from the German payer for a value of EUR 35 716 in the first quarter of 2005 according to the VIES system, but the Czech payer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activities at the company's registered office, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="695">The response to the RU received from Germany revealed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods had been taken over by the contracted carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After discovering fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Czech purchaser, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="699">The SAO inquired at the locally competent tax office in the Czech Republic and found that, based on the information obtained, the tax administrator assessed the Czech payer for VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388 522 (EUR 13 044).</seg>
<seg id="700">Based on the request of the SAO, BRH confirmed that the German supplier declared the delivery of goods to the Czech payer after repairs only in the amount of EUR 7 916.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German taxpayer reported the corrected values of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter in which the repairs took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus, its SH included the following values of the delivery in relation to the Czech taxpayer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator asked the SCAC form to verify the delivery of goods and the provision of services carried out in the third quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this RU, the Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods totalling EUR 396,126 to the German taxpayer during this period and provided services in the amount of EUR 11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation in order to verify this delivery with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="707">In reply to the RU, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with a production line including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">The individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech taxpayer before the Czech Republic entered the EU and after 1.5.2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not take over the assembled line because it claimed that it had defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the third quarter of 2005 the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for the amounts of EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer took over the issued invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO also found that all invoices were properly recorded in the accounts of the Czech payer by enquiring of the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="713">The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 only show the amounts that were evidenced by the Czech payer and which relate to invoicing after 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that on the basis of the reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax office in Germany concluded that the transaction concerned the supply of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer including services for assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this special case, the place of the so-called performance of work is where the assembly of the production line took place.</seg>
<seg id="716">According to the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the supplied service is obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient can claim a VAT deduction on the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT tax return were neglected by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to the VIES data, in February 2005, Czech payer A should have purchased a machine worth EUR 58 000 from German payer C.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="721">In response to the RI, the German party stated that this machine had already been delivered by German payer C to Czech payer B in 2004, but that the machine should have been returned to German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but was transported to the organizational component of German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Further, the response to the request for information showed that German payer C sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational component of German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">As the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intra-community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">The SAO inquired with the tax administrator of the locally competent payer B and found that according to VIES data, the German payer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="727">The payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the RU to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the response to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">Further investigation with the payer B revealed that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the accounts of the payer B, and that it could be a machine of the same type as the one delivered by the organizational component of the German payer C to the Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator of the locally competent payer A had carried out a local investigation with this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had an invoice from the German payer C dated 7 February 2005, on which the payer A was listed as the purchaser of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that the payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">A payer A had a lease agreement with another Czech company, where the lease was for a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The machine was handed over from the leasing company on February 9, 2005, and the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C had not delivered the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intra-community supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognize the German payer C's VAT exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German payer D supplied the machine to the Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">BRH also found that the German payer C had indicated in his SH for the first quarter of 2005 the supply of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relations between the participants in the above-mentioned commercial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO found that the Czech tax administration received a request for information from the German tax administration on 4 October 2005, in which the German tax administrator asked for verification of the intra-community delivery from the German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this case was a fake intra-community delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">The RU also stated that the German payer had not carried out any active commercial activity since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the statement of the manager of the Czech company, the above-mentioned case appeared to be a claim of the German payer against the German tax administration, which the Czech payer asserted as a partner of the German company at the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator does not have any information that the German tax administration has solved the issue related to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, yet the mentioned value is still included in the VIES system as an intra-community supply of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the recipients did not declare intra-community acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the VIES data, the German payer delivered goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. The Czech payer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">THISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator requested verification of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods were collected by the Czech payer personally.</seg>
<seg id="757">By enquiring with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that before receiving the response to the RU, the Czech payer had submitted additional VAT returns for the given periods.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended a tax inspection of the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The inspection has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. The German payer delivered goods worth EUR 46,854 to the Czech payer according to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="761">The Czech payer granted intra-community acquisitions only in the amount corresponding to EUR 14,856 for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator requested verification within the international exchange of information on the value of the effected deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="763">The response to the RU, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with the total value of the delivery of goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="764">The SAO inquired with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that after receiving the reply from the FRY, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech payer and agreed with her to discuss with the owner of the company the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004 after examining these invoices.</seg>
<seg id="765">The supplementary VAT return has not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would proceed in order to comply with the stipulated deadlines for a possible supplementary VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">The German payer was supposed to deliver goods worth EUR 11,600 to the Czech payer in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="769">The German tax administrator asked for confirmation within the international exchange of information whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged partner of the German payer had established several fictitious companies in the FRY.</seg>
<seg id="770">During the examination of the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed to the tax office the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from the FRY to the CR and were resold during 2005 in the FRY.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted documents on the sale of the goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, did not declare or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in reply to the IRS.</seg>
<seg id="775">The SAO found out that the Czech payer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, including the value of the acquisition of the goods from the German payer and at the same time claimed the right to deduct the tax on the acquisition of the goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">The VAT on the sale of the goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after the local investigation without change.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, the acquisition of the goods from other Member States was not involved, because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator therefore carried out an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax administrator corrected the German payer's tax return immediately after receiving a reply to the RU stating that the goods had not left Germany and demanded from him VAT amounting to EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the relevant tax office sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods would be correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, the payers reported intra-community transactions which probably did not actually take place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">A copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech payer for VAT was attached to the request.</seg>
<seg id="786">A copy of the passport of the person who was said to have carried out the transfer of the said car was also attached.</seg>
<seg id="787">The Czech tax administrator discovered that the passport had been stolen, that the person mentioned in the passport had not imported any vehicle into the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The certificate of registration for VAT, a copy of which was sent by the German party, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="789">The Czech tax administrator included this information in the reply to the RUC together with the communication that he could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">The SAO found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address given in the Commercial Register and that the manager of the company was not contactable.</seg>
<seg id="791">The Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech payer for a tax liability of CZK 0 after the complaint procedure carried out for the tax period February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="792">Further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question had been sold to another Czech entity who had purchased it through an advertisement on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the locally competent German tax administrator, based on the Czech response to the IRS, would not recognize the German tax payer's right to exemption from VAT for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax office was not able to clarify the difference of EUR 3,000 between the value of the acquired goods declared in the tax return of the payer and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was reported that the Czech payer was supposed to deliver goods worth EUR 89,424 to the German payer during the fourth quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested verification of the supplies and their payment in the framework of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In response to the IRS, the Czech tax administrator stated that the sole agent of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new agent had not been registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to a partner of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed VAT and SH tax returns, which were signed by an unauthorized person – the said partner of the company – after the manager had been deleted from the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech payer confirmed to the tax administrator that the partner of the company had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Treasury documents were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic, enquired with the local tax office, found that the tax administrator recognized the Czech payer for the fourth quarter of 2004 the right to be exempt from VAT on the supply of goods to another Member State in the amount of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for the first quarter of 2005 in the amount of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany had not corrected the German payer's VAT return, because a German judge had in the meantime confirmed the German payer's insolvency.</seg>
<seg id="804">As the earlier inspection did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to enforce the assessed tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to the VIES data, the German payer acquired goods from the Czech Republic in 2005 worth EUR 4 251 196, after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">In the 2004 tax return and in the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not declare intra-community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="807">In addition, he did not declare any reasonable supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these differences, the German tax office sent the RU relating to the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">The Czech supplier reported intra-community supplies of goods to the German payer in the SH for these two quarters, totalling CZK 167 246 083 (EUR 5 615 299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the RU was delivered, in which the German party requested to check whether the Czech payer's declared intra-community supplies had been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this RU, the Czech tax administration stated that the request of the German party could not be complied with, because the Czech payer had no agent.</seg>
<seg id="812">As the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax administrator show, on 30 March 2006, a protocol was drawn up with the Czech payer's manager to start the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The payer was also asked by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above mentioned periods, but did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the only manager of the Czech payer ceased to be in office on 16 May 2006, a new manager was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">From April 2006, the Czech payer stopped filing VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the audit, the SAO, in cooperation with BRH, examined, among other things, several cases of intra-community supplies made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which had not been the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the audited cases was exchanged between the two supreme audit institutions via the Customs Offices of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (eCR), which is not resident in Germany, informed the relevant tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intended to carry out a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information, the company was registered since June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) received an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind power plants and for the delivery of these wind power plants in the name, at the risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to a lack of own capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the method of transportation of wind power plants:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the place of execution of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– A Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind power plants for assembly under his name, at his risk and on his own account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">As the assembly of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind power plants is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– As the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his own risk and on his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport began – in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind power plants were sent to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption as the other Member State of destination is different from the other Member State of the seat of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined at the beginning of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">The transport of some wind power plants started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The supply of those wind power plants that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The supply of the other wind power plants that are produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intra-community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community supplies from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not declare any intra-community acquisitions in its tax return for VAT in Germany nor did it file a SH with the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intra-community supplies uniformly as intra-community supplies from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that the (eCR) did not declare any intra-community supplies to Austria, but intra-community supplies to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">Examination of the taxation of intra-community acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though the case does not show any sign of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">The SAO and BRH also examined the transactions to point out the differences between the tax return and the VIES data, which were caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that the changes in the legislation need time for the application of the new legislation by both payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In the SH for the second to fourth quarters of 2004, the Czech payer reported intra-community delivery to the German payer for a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).</seg>
<seg id="841">For the same period, another Czech payer in the SH reported intra-community delivery to another German payer for a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers reported the above-mentioned supplies in the SH in accordance with the wording of Act No.235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">By further examining the above-mentioned transactions, the SAO auditing group found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal regulation of the supply or purchase of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic, payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intra-community supply of goods, from the point of view of the German statutory regulation valid in 2004 it was not an intra-community acquisition, but a taxable supply with the place of performance in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in the statutory regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., which amends certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. When examining selected intra-community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer reported intra-community supplies to the German payer in the SH for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2005 in the total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) and another Czech payer reported intra-community supplies to the German payer in the SH for the same period in the total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by the SAO from the BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No.235/2004 Coll., effective from 1.1.2005, in the case of the supply of electricity, the place of supply is the place where the purchaser has its registered office, place of business or where it has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have reported the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">By reporting intra-Community supplies of electricity in SH, both above-mentioned payers distorted the VIES data by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation fulfilled the objectives of BRH and the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs gained a deeper knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and showed that the VAT administration legislation differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">During parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were found.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them make sense to be subsequently examined.</seg>
<seg id="858">Based on the inspection findings, both SAIs made recommendations concerning the VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">The follow-up of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up inspection.</seg>
<seg id="860">New experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in the audits of the administration of excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted joint report informs on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in the parallel audits carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, aimed at the administration of excise duties in the period after the accession of both countries to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was carried out on the basis of a contract on cooperation in the audit activity concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of the parallel audits was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties, which took place in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including goods subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow the circulation of goods free of tax until the day of their delivery for final consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with the above principle, the new legislation, adopted in both countries, allows goods to move under tax supervision under a conditional exemption regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on the tax administration and assumes close cooperation between the competent administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in audits of excise tax administration for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>

<seg id="13">Audit subject: (CR) Excise tax administration (SR) Procedure of the competent authorities in the administration of excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="14">On 8 February 2006, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “SAO-CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as “SAO SR”) concluded the “Contract on Cooperation in Audit Activities”.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in the parallel audits "Administration of Excise Taxes", included in the SAO-CR Audit Plan for 2005 under No. 05/34, and "Control of the procedure of colných orgánov in the administration of excise taxes", included in the SAO-CR Audit Plan for 2006 under No. 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel audits had the character of a coordinated audit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information that the contracting parties could not obtain during the audit of the administration of excise taxes on the territory of their country, and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the audits within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI auditing standards - Directive No. 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the territory of the Czech Republic, the audit (hereinafter referred to as the "CR") was carried out by groups of auditors from the State Budget Department and from the territorial departments of central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia in the period from 7 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>

<seg id="24">The aim of the parallel audits was to examine the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">The international cooperation was focused on the procedure of the tax administrators in the performance of supervision of the transport of goods subject to excise duties, in particular on the registration of started and finished transport under the suspension regime, and on the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the excise tax administrators of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="33">The difference to 100% amounting to 13 billion CZK in 2004 and 6.9 billion CZK in 2005 was the revenue of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of all excise taxes in the Slovak Republic has been carried out by the customs authorities since 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise tax on mineral oil, which they have been administering since 1 January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">Until then, the administration of excise taxes was carried out by the tax authorities.</seg>

<seg id="41">The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No 353/2003 Coll., on excise duties, as amended (hereinafter referred to as Law No 353/2003 Coll.), which has been in force since 1 January 2004.</seg>
<seg id="42">In administering excise duties in the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding legislation: - Act No 98/2004 Coll. on the spotrebnej tax on mineral oil, as amended by the non-statutory regulations (hereinafter referred to as Law No 98/2004 Coll.), - Act No 104/2004 Coll. on the spotrebnej tax on wine, as amended by the non-statutory regulations (hereinafter referred to as Law No 104/2004 Coll.), - Act No 105/2004 Coll. on the spotrebnej tax on lieh, as amended by the non-statutory regulations (hereinafter referred to as Law No 105/2004 Coll.), - Act No 106/2004 Coll. on the spotrebnej tax on tobacco products, as amended by the non-statutory regulations (hereinafter referred to as Law No 106/2004 Coll.), - Act No 107/2004 Coll. on the spotrebnej tax on beer, as amended by the non-statutory regulations (hereinafter referred to as Law No 107/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="43">2.1 Movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty between the Member States of the European Union</seg>
<seg id="44">The conditions for movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty are governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods Articles 15 to 20.</seg>

<seg id="46">The consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not store or dispatch such products under suspension of duty.</seg>
<seg id="47">Authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovakia means a tax warehouse operator, the economic operator is an authorised consignee for repeated or ad hoc receipt of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="48">Transport of products subject to excise duty under suspension of duty is possible under Directive 92/12/EEC only with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document is issued by the consignor in four copies before the transport begins, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch require further copies.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure for the start and end of transport of goods under suspension of duty between the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="51">Transport from the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="52">The procedure for the start of transport is governed by the provisions of Section 25(3) of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, among other things:</seg>

<seg id="73">In respect of the transport of other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) during the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘audited period’), the taxpayer was not required to notify the Poprad Customs Office or the competent customs office of the start of the transport under the duty suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax administrator became aware of the transport of these products only during a local investigation or tax inspection from the accompanying documents and accounting documents of the taxpayer.</seg>

<seg id="91">Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty requires Member States and the European Commission to introduce an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) from 1 July 2009, which would allow excise tax authorities in individual Member States to obtain information on the transport of goods in real time.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will enable the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently used only in paper form, and will contribute to the simplification of the movement of goods under the suspension regime and to ensuring more effective control of the movement of untaxed products within all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">The system will include national databases of transport operations of individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport operations commenced and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module of the Registration of Selected Products (hereinafter referred to as EVV).</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have on-line access to the system.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of transport operations carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, tax authorities can obtain information on the commencement or termination of the transport operation immediately after registration of the accompanying document by the customs office in EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office releases the tax security for the transported products provided by the consignor at the moment of registration of the termination of the transport by the customs office of the locally competent consignee.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in the Slovak Republic use a database based on the application software SysNed, which provides automation of their activities in the administration of excise taxes and communication with the systems of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering the tax warehouse, the operator of the tax warehouse or the authorised consignee in the application software SysNed, this data is automatically transferred to the database "System for Exchange of Excise Data" (hereinafter referred to as "SEED").</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and course of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting between representatives of the SAO-CR and representatives of the SAO of the Slovak Republic, at which the concrete process of cooperation in the implementation of parallel inspections in the field of excise taxes was discussed, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">Both parties became acquainted with the legislation in the field of excise taxes and with the organization of the administration of excise taxes in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the CR and the Slovak Republic in authorizing, respectively, the beginning and ending of the transport of products subject to excise duty under the suspension regime and the exchange of information between the excise tax authorities of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides: - will process the total data on the quantity of products subject to excise duty transported from the CR to the SR and vice versa, whose transport started during the audited period, - will compare the data on mineral oil transport - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and ethyl alcohol - Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the suspension regime initiated in the CR and terminated in the SR and vice versa in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the audits, the audited periods were extended by the months of October and November 2005 and during the audits, the transport of tobacco products under the suspension regime was also subjected to the audits.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty which were transported under suspension of tax between Czech and Slovak tax subjects during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of records of transport of goods under suspension of tax exemptions</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO-CR provided the Slovak side with a database of transport operations terminated in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5,876 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items to ethyl alcohol and 4 items to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO-CR provided the Czech side with a database of transport operations terminated in the Slovak Republic, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 696 items related to mineral oil, 2,066 items to ethyl alcohol and 557 items to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO-CR compared data on transport operations listed in the register of commenced transport operations in the Czech Republic with data on completed transport operations registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">Data on transport operations in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which the SAO handed over to the SAO at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data allowing reliable reconciliation of individual transport operations and therefore only 63 % of commenced transport operations were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual transport operations were assigned according to more data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of transported products.</seg>
<seg id="115">Data on transport operations commenced in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 were compared by the SAO-CR with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93 % of commenced transport operations were unambiguously assigned.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the quantity of mineral oils were given in litres or in tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The quantity of alcohol was given in litres in most cases, which could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of the stated percentage of alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="118">The quantity of tobacco products was given in pieces, in thousands of pieces and in kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">In the case of transport operations initiated in the Czech Republic, the completion of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or where the data on the transported quantity of products did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">The documents accompanying 487 transport operations of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were checked.</seg>
<seg id="121">The documents were checked at the customs offices, where the SAO-CR performed the check.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the case of transport operations authorised by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested via the DG.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the realization of 141 shipments for which the customs offices in the CR did not prove the certified copies No.3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products indicated on the accompanying document did not correspond with the quantity of products indicated in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, the Slovak side was provided with data on the shipments registered in the Slovak database, which, however, did not contain the database of the Czech customs administration's shipments.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR searched the Slovak customs administration's database for 95 shipments.</seg>
<seg id="126">The verification of the remaining 46 shipments was requested by the locally competent customs offices, which proved their completion with copies of accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak side provided the Czech side with copies of accompanying documents, on the basis of which the shipments were identified also in the Czech database, with the exception of the shipments carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of commenced shipments.</seg>
<seg id="128">The audit of these cases found:</seg>
<seg id="129">- in the Slovak database of transports, 11 transports of alcohol in the total amount of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transports of alcohol in the total amount of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005 were registered.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-CR found that these were transports of taxed products, for which the consignor does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The consignor informed the tax administrator in writing about the commencement of the transport. The transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents, which are used for the transport of products under the suspension of tax;</seg>
<seg id="132">- in the Slovak database of transports, a total of 94 transports of mineral oils, Combined Nomenclature code 2710 11 21, were registered in the total amount of 173 thousand litres carried out by the Czech tax entity in the period from September 2004 to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-CR found that in the period from May 2004 to June 2005 the tax entity carried out the transport of 102 thousand litres of untaxed mineral oils without the appropriate authorization.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax entity held a special authorization for receiving and using products exempt from tax, on the basis of which it could supply untaxed products only to the holder of the same authorization.</seg>
<seg id="135">It did not notify the customs office in the CR of the start of the transport and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1,207,680 for the transported products.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the period July 2005 to December 2005, the tax entity transported 71 thousand litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of the SR. Even in these cases, it did not fulfil the legal obligation by failing to notify the customs office of the start of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="137">The consignor in the CR can start the transport of products put into free tax circulation in the tax territory of the CR without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office of this fact in writing before the start of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="138">The tax entity receiving products put into free tax circulation in another Member State is obliged to declare the quantity and ensure the tax before their withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="139">The products can be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are regulated by Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This regulation also allows the use of an accompanying document for transport under suspension of tax, but it must be clearly indicated that it is a "simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax control (products subject to excise duty)".</seg>
<seg id="141">The same regulation of transport and acceptance of products placed into free tax circulation in another Member State applies in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="142">In these cases, the tax entities transported the products placed into free tax circulation with an accompanying document for transport under suspension of tax, the 3rd and 4th copies of which were submitted by the consignee to the tax administrator in the Slovak Republic for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in the Slovak Republic registered these transportations in the database of transport under suspension of tax, as the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO of the Slovak Republic compared the database of transport of the Czech customs administration with the Slovak customs administration's database of transport and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases, the quantity of transported products was stated inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it difficult to compare the transported quantity of goods;</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of transported alcohol given in invoices did not match the quantity recorded in the databases;</seg>
<seg id="147">- in the databases, not all related invoices were given;</seg>
<seg id="148">- in the Slovak customs administration's database, two transports of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic carried out in November 2004 in a total volume of 47 237 litres of alcohol were recorded, which were not found in the Czech customs administration's database.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="151">Until 30 June 2005, the conditions of cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the administration of excise duties were regulated by Council Directive 77/799/EEC, concerning mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxes, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004 entered into force, laying down rules and procedures allowing the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office, which shall ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of administration of excise duties and shall be responsible for the exchange of information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, in order to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union, an “Excise Liaison Office” (hereinafter referred to as “ELO ČR”) has been established at the DG.</seg>
<seg id="155">With effect from 1 May 2004, the ELO at the Poprad Customs Office was responsible for ensuring the management of the systems for controlling the movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of ELO are carried out by the ELO Unit (based in Poprad) of the Excise Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as ‘ELO SR’).</seg>
<seg id="157">Under Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible in particular for: - the exchange of data held in the electronic register of the SEED, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of movements of excise goods sent to or received from other Member States by the Movement Verification System (MVS).</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functions of the SEED, EWSE and ISA systems are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - System for the exchange of information on tax subjects trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system is made up of national excise tax registers and allows tax authorities in the territory of the European Union to ascertain whether excise products are traded by a person authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register is made available to the competent authorities of other Member States for excise purposes only.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State ensures that persons involved in the movement of excise goods in the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information held in this database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with § 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z., with § 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z., with § 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z., with § 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. and with § 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised recipients and tax warehouses - the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering the tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically connected to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, authorised recipient or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the related data are automatically transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Slovak Customs Administration and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">The data are transferred to the SEED database in the Czech Republic from the national register, in which all persons authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorisations to dispose of these products are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Requests from customs offices to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system focused on controlling the transport of goods subject to excise duty, through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">Transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by a regulation of the European Commission is considered to be a risky consignment, and transport that is evaluated as a risk by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information takes two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - is sent when the established limits are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- a warning message - is sent when the transport of goods is evaluated as a risk.</seg>
<seg id="176">When assessing the degree of risk of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database for sending the warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data stated in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the registered office of the consignee does not match), ELO SR draws up a warning message, which it sends to the ELO office of the Member State of the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">ELO follows the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457 when drawing up the reports, which among other things determine the type and quantity of goods in the respective measurement units for drawing up informative and warning messages.</seg>
<seg id="179">During the audited period, ELO SR sent one warning message to ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on initiated transport of products in quantities exceeding the specified limits is generated automatically when entering the data from the accompanying document into the database at the time of transport approval.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates a consignment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it prepares a so-called warning message, which it sends to the respective Member State via ELO ČR.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005, ELO ČR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The MVS - the system for controlling the movement of goods - allows through MVS requests to control individual transports of products subject to excise duty as well as the control of the specified transport route between the entities mentioned in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information takes place on the basis of a request in which ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system is used especially in cases where the consignor takes over the certified copy No.3 of the accompanying document and requests e.g. reimbursement of excise duty, and in cases where the data stated in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period ELO SR sent 33 requests to MVS.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO ČR sent 25 requests to MVS.</seg>
<seg id="188">Customs offices in the Czech Republic most often examined the data stated in the accompanying documents, especially the quantity of received or dispatched products or whether the consignor of products mentioned in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of products subject to excise duty, if this fact could not be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="189">Received requests from MVS were in both countries forwarded to customs offices locally competent for the consignee or consignor of products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="190">Customs offices verified the required data and notified the result of the investigation through ELO to the other member country.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR enabled to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both countries, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia when starting and ending the transport of products under the suspension regime between the two countries, the registration of these transports and to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Comparison of legislation governing the area of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia revealed differences:</seg>
<seg id="194">a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrators when starting the transport of products under the suspension regime.</seg>
<seg id="195">The transport of products under suspension of tax exemption can be started by a tax subject in the Czech Republic only with the consent of the tax administrator, who will allow the transport to start on condition that the transported products have been provided with a guarantee of tax amounting to the amount of tax attributable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The start of the transport of products under suspension of tax exemption in the Slovak Republic is not subject to the permission of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, the tax subject was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">The transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could start without informing the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, amendments to all excise tax laws were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under suspension of tax is obliged to send a copy No. 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office, which is competent locally, before the transport starts;</seg>
<seg id="200">b) within the deadlines for sending copy No. 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The consignee in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy No.3 and copy No.4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification no later than the following working day after the completion of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">The certified copy No.3 is obliged to send to the consignor no later than the following working day after its receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in the Slovak Republic is obliged to send to the consignor of products copy No.3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the consignee of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">6.2. Customs authorities in both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and manner of keeping such records is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="206">Customs authorities in both countries enter into the records all data from accompanying documents on the basis of which the transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">For the monitoring of the transport of goods under suspension of tax between Member States of the European Union, there is currently no single electronic system that allows excise tax authorities in each Member State to obtain information on the transport of goods in real time.</seg>
<seg id="208">According to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for the monitoring of the transport of products subject to excise tax is foreseen from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of a contract on cooperation in control activities, the Czech side transmitted to the Slovak side a database of transports of products under suspension of tax started in the Slovak Republic and finished in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5 876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak side transmitted to the Czech side a database of transports of products under suspension of tax started in the Czech Republic and finished in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3 319 items relating to transported mineral oils, ethyl alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech side compared the data on transport operations listed in the register of commenced transport operations in the Czech Republic with the register of transport operations terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak side compared the data on transport operations of goods under suspension of tax commenced in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">The comparison of the data was made more difficult by the fact that the quantity of transported goods was not reported uniformly in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to unambiguously assign the data on individual transport operations in the two registers, a check of the accompanying documents was carried out and no violations of the suspension of tax or cases of tax evasion were detected.</seg>
<seg id="217">Based on the findings from the parallel checks, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the transport registers to improve the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more efficient control of movements under the suspension arrangement in the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of the ex-post audit</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes generally constitute a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">An example of this is value added tax (VAT) fraud.</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated every year in the European Union (EU).</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005, participants of the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As part of this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very suitable area for audit cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, BRH) carried out the first parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is spread throughout the EU, close cooperation between SAIs is necessary to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out the subsequent parallel auditing.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Audit number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Audit subject: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up audit)</seg>
<seg id="18">Audit objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the auditing operation was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for resolving selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries within the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The auditing operation was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was also intended to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting audit findings were intended for comparison with the established best practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008, in case of factual connections also the periods before and after, until the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel audit actions</seg>
<seg id="25">The follow-up audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">During the previous parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-community transactions were detected.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them required further examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">Based on the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations concerning the VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up audit action performed was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">Furthermore, the audit focused on, for example, selected cases of high-risk intra-community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of claims and the implementation of VAT controls on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the audit of the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors arrived at the following audit findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions of registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel controls, a comparison of the VAT registration systems in both countries revealed differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As the different registration methods cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions of registration of payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation was presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT payers' tax identification numbers database.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also modified common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAIs expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of this document, agreed by EU Member States in the framework of ECOFIN, no longer contains the mentioned issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to consider this intention as a relevant tool for prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="44">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU States introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements to allow for a more timely verification of the values of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for the submission of recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit recapitulative statements monthly was not introduced by the deadline in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of data in the VIES system and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous audit, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraudulent activities will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The audit found that our two Member States use different risk management systems, which have their advantages and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system, which allows exchange of information within the EU, while the BRH focused on the German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected cases of intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous audit operation, business transactions where there were doubts about their completion or irregularities in the reporting of business transactions in tax returns or summary reports by tax payers from both countries were examined together.</seg>
<seg id="58">The two SAIs selected nine cases for the follow-up, which included intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The audits carried out by the tax authorities of the respective countries were not closed on the date of completion of our previous joint audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="60">The follow-up operation verified that most of the tax procedures related to the selected cases of commercial transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were closed and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT assessments or avoidance of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Audit of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intra-community transactions carried out by EU payers, which were included in the EUROCANET system, were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="63">The EUROCANET system is a tool for detecting risky tax payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">Participation of the Member States in the system is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the system if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information about which suppliers with the German VAT ID were assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">The SAO found cases of common commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent behaviour related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrators have limited possibilities of controlling risky transactions, especially when it comes to missing traders, and mere physical verification of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation arises for tax administrators when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intra-Community carousel trades.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be advisable to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation as well as to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools for detecting risky tax payers are being used, which until now have proved successful for the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, there is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Council of the EU reached a political agreement on a draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in using EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new network for combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the way of handling requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics were not the same.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the SAIs agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to prepare an analysis based on more detailed statistics to help the Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the opinion of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with a low recovery rate so that they can increase the recovery rate to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Audit of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAIs analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control of large tax entities (hereinafter referred to as "VDS") in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they gathered information from the tax authorities in the form of a questionnaire on the areas that the SAIs consider essential for managing this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The responses received clearly show that the situation is developing differently in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system in place to guide the selection of risk-prone cases, which is based on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from the tax controls carried out, balance sheet and profit and loss statements, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2012, it is planned to set up a specialised tax office for the administration of VDS.</seg>
<seg id="96">In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far focused more on the selection of individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of data from the VAT return and the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of these data is based on various components of risk management, which will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Conduct of the control action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Conduct of the control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The control was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Department II. - the State Budget Revenue Department and the Territorial Departments IX. Plzeň, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also referred to as the “Czech Ministry of Finance”) and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter referred to as the “FÚ”): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ Břeclav, FÚ Domažlice, FÚ Hodonín, FÚ Hradec Králové, FÚ Cheb, FÚ Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ Karlovy Vary, FÚ Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava III, FÚ Písek, FÚ Plzeň, FÚ pro Prahu 1, FÚ pro Prahu 4, FÚ pro Prahu 8, FÚ Rakovník, FÚ v Sokolově, FÚ v Tábor, FÚ v Vysoké Mýt, FÚ Zlín and FÚ Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion of this auditing operation was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Conduct of the auditing operation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The auditing operation was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Indirect Taxation Audit Service and by the staff of the designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the auditing operation.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to the interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit operation was carried out in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following financial offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, discussions were held with the tax offices Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-South) and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In preparation of the parallel audit actions, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions was held in September 2008 to discuss and establish the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">Subsequently, in December 2008, the highest representatives of the two SAIs signed an agreement on cooperation in the implementation of the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="114">At the meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other about the initial results achieved during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the next steps.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on 2-4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams exchanged the previously collected findings and agreed together on a timetable for the preparation of the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of recommendations made in the previous report; • screening of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not solved during the previous parallel audit; • screening of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high risk; • auditing of the tax administrations' progress in the area of international assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • tax audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audits was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Auditing of the VAT administration in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions for registration of tax payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended modification of the conditions for registration for VAT and introduction of a new rule for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce the risk of possible tax evasion in the collection of VAT more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not make use of the right to cancel VAT registration for payers who did not comply with the obligations arising from Act No.235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter the "VAT Act").</seg>
<seg id="127">The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed a change in the provision introducing an obligation for tax administrators to cancel VAT registration for payers in case of repeated failure to file a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator can cancel a tax payer's registration "ex offo" in cases where: (a) the payer did not perform a performance for twelve consecutive months without notifying the tax administrator of the reason; (b) the payer does not comply with his obligations arising from this Act; (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous auditing operation, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the Tax Office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers who did not incur any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Tax Office for Prague 1 often did not cancel the VAT registration of these payers because the relevant provision set an insufficient deadline for the cancellation of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was remedied by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-established tax payer in case the tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of summary reports</seg>
<seg id="135">In the framework of international cooperation, the previous auditing operation recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive reduces the period for the submission of recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">There is also a new obligation to submit recapitulative statements in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="138">The recapitulative statement must be submitted to the taxpayer even if the services for which the place of performance is determined in accordance with Section 9(1) of the VAT Act are provided to a person registered for tax in another Member State and if the recipient is obliged to declare and pay tax on these services.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements with a view to achieving greater reliability of data in the VIES system This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration carries out a comparison of data on intra-Community transactions reported in VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech payers in an automated way in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore one of the priority areas of interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is evidenced by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to determine the difference between the eligible and actually collected VAT levels in the 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as the EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on the analysis of the available data, the author concluded that the estimated loss from uncollected VAT for this period is between EUR 90 and 113 billion, while on average 12% of the eligible VAT is not collected annually in the EU-25.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18 %.</seg>
<seg id="150">Within the framework of international cooperation, the previous audit operation stated that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system, which is used for information exchange in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-community transactions carried out by EU tax payers, included in the EUROCANET system, were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved by setting up the EUROFISC network, which should improve cooperation between the responsible authorities into a form that allows fraud to be detected in its bud.</seg>
<seg id="155">The network should later also become an important source of information in the assessment of risks in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council already approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812 and at the same time laid down the basic principles that will guide the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The EUROFISC model is the already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report produced the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration has established a well-functioning system for the registration of tax payers, based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance drew the Commission's attention to this system in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system is being improved on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">At present, the questionnaire data is electronically processed and will subsequently serve for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission has presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">The BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to safeguard the already achieved level of standards in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, the Act transposing EU Directives into national law was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="173">This Act contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">These provisions took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group composed of staff from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance was established.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for automatic comparison of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy is still being discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the working group looked at a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany is a participant in this exchange within the framework of the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and, following a written consultation on 18 October 2006, the establishment of the risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform are further divided into sub-groups dealing with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influencing negotiations, • evaluations, • updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports on the results of the activities of these sub-groups were published in early 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and de-registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT payer tax identification number database.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issue of registration and de-registration was left for the time being to the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany did not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached a political agreement on the draft regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The idea of common minimum standards was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States have to implement national procedures and are only obliged to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation about these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission has not been able to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore welcome further efforts by the Commission in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="201">In the framework of international cooperation, a previous control action recommended that all EU States introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of recapitulative statements, allowing for more timely verification of the values of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for the submission of recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it came into effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany did not introduce an obligation to submit recapitulative statements monthly according to a specified calendar, while the Czech Republic did (in line with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve higher reliability of data in the VIES system and consideration of linking the two systems for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the BRH's recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of detecting risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO performed an audit of the EUROCANET system used for the exchange of information in the EU (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">BRH focused on the German participation in the so-called risk management platform in this area.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">In the previous audit operation, the execution of commercial transactions where there were doubts about their execution, or inconsistencies in the way the tax payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their VAT returns or summary reports, was jointly examined.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected for the follow-up nine cases involving intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, whose control carried out by the tax administrations of both countries had not been completed during the previous joint audit operation.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech payer purchased goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer.</seg>
<seg id="217">This acquisition of goods was not declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return, because the German payer had not been allocated a VAT ID during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to be allocated a VAT ID in order for intra-Community delivery of goods to be exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A follow-up audit by the SAO revealed that on the basis of the control carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return, in which he declared the acquisition of goods worth the stated value and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT in the same amount in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">The Czech payer should have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not appear in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">Upon request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administration refused to cooperate as the turnover of the transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax authority did not obtain evidence, it terminated the inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">Subsequent audit The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer invoiced the goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer purchased the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in the regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to purchase a passenger car worth EUR 48 500 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="229">The acquisition of the goods in question was not declared by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="230">Since August 2004, this payer has not filed VAT returns, so the tax administrator has charged VAT of CZK 0 for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007, the tax administrator asked the taxpayer to file an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer did not file.</seg>
<seg id="232">A subsequent inspection found that the tax administrator had carried out further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the passenger car in question had been sold by the Czech taxpayer to a used car dealership in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a payment notice for the tax period in December 2004, which issued an additional VAT assessment for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and their subsequent sale amounting to CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech taxpayer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of executions of the taxpayer's actionable assets, this arrears appears to be uncollectable.</seg>
<seg id="236">(4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech taxpayer was supposed to make deliveries of new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005 in the total value of EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">The response to the request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that tax-criminal proceedings against the German entity were pending in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">During the subsequent audit, BRH was informed that after the completion of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was demonstrably found that the German taxpayer had been included in fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intracommunal acquisition of goods was taxed in the value of EUR 182 424 (2004) and EUR 369 690 (2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO found that the Czech taxpayer had been involved in carousel transactions with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information from the German tax administration regarding the verification of the delivery of goods, a VAT audit for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005 was initiated with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and information obtained within the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the period of May 2005 in the amount of CZK 703 031 and for the period of June 2005 in the amount of CZK 726 551.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, the Czech payer A was supposed to purchase from the German payer a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was supposed to deliver to the Czech payer B a machine with a value of EUR 88 027 in the 3rd quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="247">The SAO's subsequent audit found that the payer B purchased the machine from a German company that had an organizational component established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech payer A did not declare the acquisition of goods from the German payer in its VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The response from the German tax administrator to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intra-community delivery of the machine with a value of EUR 58 000, but a delivery of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">BRH's follow-up audit found that after the tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a supply of the machine within the Czech Republic and the VAT exemption was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">The German tax payer was supposed to deliver goods worth EUR 11 600 to the Czech payer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO's follow-up audit found that the Czech tax administrator assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was improperly stated, including the acquisition of goods worth the stated value.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that after receiving the response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the German payer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT worth EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to the tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="257">The summary report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, because only the payer who submitted the summary report can make corrections to the summary reports in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After the tax procedure carried out for the tax period February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech payer's tax liability at CZK 0 and informed the German tax administrator that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been cancelled in 2007 for non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator sent the documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">A subsequent audit by the BRH found that the German payer had changed its registered office and the new local tax administrator had cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the car to the Czech payer based on the audit.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German tax payer had not corrected the data in the summary report and filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to the VIES data, the German tax payer delivered goods totalling EUR 33,205 to the Czech tax payer between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">The SAO's subsequent audit revealed that the Czech tax administrator had attempted to find out the causes of the differences created by the Czech tax payer in the acquisition of goods between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the acquired goods amounting to CZK 134,273 for the period between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005, as according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture the commercial transactions for the individual quarters and therefore the tax administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German tax payer delivered goods amounting to EUR 46,854 to the Czech tax payer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">The Czech tax payer declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14,856 for the same period.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of the effected supplies within the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with the total value of the delivery of goods stated at EUR 31,998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech tax payer in the VAT return and the data provided in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax payer filed the additional VAT return for the tax period from July 2004 to January 2007 after many urges from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="275">In this tax return, the tax payer also claimed the right to deduct the VAT, thus the tax obligation for the given tax period remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="276">The follow-up audit verified that for selected cases of commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax procedures had been completed and that the tax administrators in both the Czech Republic and Germany had taken adequate measures (i.e. additionally assessed the VAT or prevented the refund of the input tax).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Results of the audit in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be an important source of information for detecting risky entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared with the data on acquirers by the relevant local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting from the first quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risky transactions and on tax entities acting as suppliers to the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="282">Within the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States were captured in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">As the German tax administration did not participate in the EUROCANET data exchange, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT ID were assessed as risky entities by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit operation revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trades or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where relevant, tax administrations used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrations did not detect any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">Tax authorities continuously monitor such tax entities due to their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• Tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the submitted accounting records during the verification of risky transactions, although they found irregularities in the area of transport and storage of goods or revealed business relationships with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated as some tax payers did not cooperate with tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">Locally competent tax authorities mostly examined risky tax entities and risky transactions listed in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax authorities have limited possibilities in the verification of risky transactions, especially in relation to the verification of missing traders, and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to a tax entity only from the physical control of documents.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter requirements for VAT registration of payers and more flexible cancellation of registrations would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT registration takes place for the purpose of reporting fictitious deliveries of goods within the EU or for issuing formally correct tax documents to payers who, on the basis of these documents, unduly draw input VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where the involvement of tax entities in carousel trade and other fraud is suspected and goods are imported and exported from third countries, it would be advisable to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in transport documentation, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">Participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament in late 2008 as a weakness of the system which should be eliminated by the establishment of a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of the control in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Tax Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="303">This data was the criterion for selecting six files of German tax payers for control.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Thus, Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives data from EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:.in the view of the government, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">Currently, there is no legal basis for violating the applicable rules on the confidentiality of tax information.</seg>
<seg id="308">Moreover, the government has no reliable information on how such data is used in EUROCANET by other Member States."17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of data from EUROCANET and forwarding them to the Länder tax authorities in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relationships of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities receive no information on whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relationships with traders from other Member States who also have business relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, the control in this area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences in terms of detecting VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to establish a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The EU Council reached a political agreement on a draft regulation, the main contribution of which is the establishment of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experience gained from the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the envisaged VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases brought before courts at both national and European level show that a discussion between Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intra-Community transactions seems necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following directives provide the basic framework for international cooperation for the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No 252/2000 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order and at the same time to amend the aforementioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008 is a new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">The annex to the Regulation sets out new models of requests, which have been in use since 1 January 2009, newly stipulates the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the applicant authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">The main principles for providing international cooperation in the recovery of claims:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance is always provided only on the basis of a request containing the prescribed particulars;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. assistance does not apply to financial claims that are of the nature of a criminal law sanction in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. the provision of international assistance for the recovery of claims is governed by the national law of the State which has been requested for assistance;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims do not have priority in the recovery;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance is provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has, without success, used all applicable possibilities for the recovery of a claim provided for in its legal order).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No 191/2004 defines three forms by which the assistance takes place, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The locally competent financial authority electronically sends the request for information, the request for delivery or the request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance via the financial directorates.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance arranges a translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it including the annexes and sends it via the CCN/CSI network to the competent tax authority of the designated State.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two basic requirements for recovery: the claim must be higher than EUR 1 500 and must not be older than 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="345">If these requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse recovery.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">On receiving a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must acknowledge receipt of the request as soon as possible, and no later than within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it will inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection of the request, indicating the specific provisions of the directive on which it relies.</seg>
<seg id="349">This communication must be sent no later than three months from the date of the acknowledgement of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify whether the request has all the requisites according to the law and should immediately forward the request through the Financial Directorate to the locally competent Financial Office for execution.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator will, among other things, identify the debtor's assets, e.g. by taking extracts from the Real Estate Register, by checking accounts at banks, by verifying the registration of vehicles at the Transport Inspectorate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">After six months have elapsed from the date on which the receipt of the request was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation that was carried out in order to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities, when it is not possible to recover the claim, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any amount recovered by the tax administrator will be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month from the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator recovering foreign claims will allow it to wait to be paid or to be paid in instalments, if the state that requested the recovery gives its consent.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the recovery period, the debtor is prescribed interest or a penalty payment in accordance with Act No 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty payment belongs to the state that requested the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not send requests to the locally competent tax administrators for processing in a timely manner, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the context of international assistance for the recovery of claims as well as in the case of requests received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No 191/2004 Coll., because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in the recovery within six months from the date when the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">In accordance with the provisions of Section 13, paragraph 4 of Act No 191/2004 Coll., the Czech Ministry of Finance processes every year by 15 March statistical data for the European Commission, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery sent or received in the past year, indicating the amount of claims covered by the requests.</seg>
<seg id="364">The European Commission processes a report on the state of recovery of claims, which it submits to the EU Council and the European Parliament, on the basis of documents provided by all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance undervalued the statistical data due to an error in the item of recovered claims in 2008 by EUR 5 250 000 by indicating the incorrect value of the recovered claim for VAT (this was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to the value in euros).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error was subsequently reflected in the European Commission statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance, including recovered amounts, is presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International assistance for recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal mandate for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Directive on recovery of claims) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In order to make the wording more accessible and easier to understand, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the (EC) Act on the collection of state taxes of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The recovery procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code emphasises that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities which are in force in national jurisdiction and on the basis of the EC Act on Administrative Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) enshrines the statutory provisions governing the recovery procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative acts of the tax authorities are governed in particular by the instructions for execution and the instructions for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance has reached an agreement with representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder regarding the principles of administrative assistance for the assessment of taxes and has transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general prerequisites for submitting recovery applications are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• Legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic means of recovery have already been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• Claims which are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.</seg>
<seg id="382">• No more than 5 years must elapse between the issue of the recovery order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. it is no longer subject to appeal) and the date on which the applications are submitted.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending recovery applications to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the relevant foreign office, such as the Czech Customs Office, via the Intermediation Office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">The closer procedure is governed by the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 Currently, a working group of the Federal and Land Governments is reviewing this Methodological Guideline in order to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The request, including the annexes, is submitted electronically by the Tax Office to the Intermediation Office.</seg>
<seg id="388">The Tax Office checks the correctness of the request in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the request is not correct, it is returned to the relevant Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it fulfils all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office subsequently ensures the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and also arranges the translation of the request.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receiving recovery applications from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Recovery applications received from other Member States are registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and within 10 days it sends an acknowledgement of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office checks whether the formal requirements have been fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office submits these applications to the intermediary office, which then forwards them to the relevant tax offices and monitors their execution.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the application takes more than 6 months to process, it invites the intermediary office to submit a preliminary report, which must be submitted in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">After checking the formal and factual elements of the application, the implementing services notify the method of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="399">All recovered amounts must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the application within one month of their receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual assistance for recovery between Germany and the Czech Republic in the years 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) is contained in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Enforcement control, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">In the framework of international cooperation, 21 applications for international assistance for recovery between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the verification.</seg>
<seg id="404">Examination of the 10 selected cases revealed, among others:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received from Germany a request for recovery of VAT claims for the years 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, i.e. CZK 109 820, from a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax administration until 26 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administration established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">As even by mortgaging the real estate it was not possible to pay the entire enforced claim, a payment schedule with instalments of at least CZK 2,000 per month was agreed with the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, information on the status of the enforcement of the claim was sent to the German tax administration, with the claim being partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49,600 as of 25 August 2009.</seg>
<seg id="411">This amount was sent to Germany and a further instalment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany on 28 August 2009.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed in Germany the amount of EUR 180,869, i.e. CZK 4,434,915, on VAT and on income tax and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the tax administrator until 27 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">The tax administrator, by examining the ownership of accounts at banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">Furthermore, a local investigation found that the debtor did not stay at his permanent residence address for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning the turnover tax arrears and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3 139, i.e. CZK 84 846.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax administrator on 6 August 2008, although already on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that the request for recovery was settled by the payment of the claim by the Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also paid in the framework of recovery in the Czech Republic and sent to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to the long time limits within which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorised tax administrators, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and by recovery of the claim by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against the claim from another request for recovery of EUR 6 649, which should have been sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance records only the request for recovery of the claim amounting to EUR 3 139 with this company, the request for recovery of the claim amounting to EUR 6 649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance with the company in question.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech taxpayer who owed EUR 39 957 in income tax and VAT and accessories in Germany, i.e. CZK 956 654.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1 June 2009, the procedure for the recovery of the claim was initiated, execution was ordered for the attachment of the claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and for the deduction on wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7 000).</seg>
<seg id="431">During negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax administrator found out that the taxpayer had been willing to pay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="433">The taxpayer promised to discuss the request with the German tax administrator in order to obtain a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery of the claim continued during the auditing operation of the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity that owed a total of EUR 113 444, i.e. CZK 3 116 304, in income tax for 2005 and in turnover tax for 2003-2007 and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the Prague 1 Tax Authority, which is responsible for administering the tax at non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, as it was not possible to determine the tax administrator with local jurisdiction based on the address of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="438">During the auditing operation, the FÚ received information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FÚ was no longer able to issue an enforcement order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery of the claim only after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated the enforcement of the claim and issued an enforcement order for attaching the claim to the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit cooperatives.</seg>
<seg id="440">The enforcement of the claim continued during the auditing operation of the SAO.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation in the recovery of the VAT claim and the costs of the proceedings totalling CZK 146 223 742 on October 3, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax administration until May 13, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="444">On September 8, 2008, the German tax administrator transferred to the Czech authorities through the Federal Bank the amount obtained from the execution of the funds in the debtor's account amounting to EUR 17 700, i.e. CZK 439 226.</seg>
<seg id="445">An error in the conversion of the recovered amount was found during the verification of the recovered amount.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recovered amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 erroneously to EUR 583 378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct conversion of the recovered amount amounts to EUR 5 833 781.83.</seg>
<seg id="448">The request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of the tax arrears from a Czech tax entity which owed CZK 1 970 632, or EUR 79 847, in respect of VAT and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the request to the German tax administration until 10 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator requested the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant decreases in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the related liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to pay the arrears: on 8 April 2009, EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009, EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009, EUR 2 500.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the German tax administrator agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 until 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">A request for recovery totalling EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including a claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22.5.2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2.10.2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3.4.2009 the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the request had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified the refund on the grounds that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax administration further stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims related to income tax and wealth tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and wealth taxes, which are listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with Article 1(4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to draw up and submit a new request for recovery excluding arrears of real estate transfer tax amounting to CZK 61 759 and including arrears of VAT, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be re-sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the Czech tax administration for the recovery of tax arrears concerning the same tax entity that owes CZK 7 079 735 in income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administration sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed CZK 3 445 782 in personal income tax and VAT, i.e. EUR 123 328.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of this amount, VAT amounted to CZK 1 133 967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax administration only on 18 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech tax authority the reply of the German tax authority dated 9 July 2007 until 11 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax authority had issued an execution order on 11 June 2007 for a bank account, which however stated that it had no business relations with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">The German tax authority thus considered the request to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax authority sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT tax arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845, or EUR 43,591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The request from the Czech tax authority was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax authority on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax authority executed the debtor's funds on bank accounts and payroll deduction and established a lien on immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authority on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">The response to the request for information received by the Czech tax administration on 16 September 2005 showed that the Czech tax entity was in Germany and had income of EUR 8 437 from non-business activities.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received the response to the request for recovery on 20 April 2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax administration only on 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The response stated that no enforcement proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the debtor's insolvency - no assets were found and his non-business income was already subject to another enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="481">The German tax administration thus considered the request for recovery to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international assistance for recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the way in which requests for international assistance for recovery of claims are handled is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and the BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In the 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of inconsistencies in the statistics has decreased, even though the number of requests has increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important that statistical issues are discussed again at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent inconsistencies, otherwise the data reported by individual EU States in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should report the annual number of requests as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of claims recovered by individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by the Member States, as this may assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in fighting VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that the recovery rate can be calculated broken down by Member State, both SAIs consider it useful for Member States with lower recovery rates to step up their efforts and try to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for recovery of claims on time to the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found for requests for international assistance received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance for the Recovery of Claims, because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months from the date when the receipt of the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for the control of VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons that were established or established for the purpose of business and whose net turnover for the tax period stated in the personal/corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="504">The classification of a tax entity as a VDS took place after the submission of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time for 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">A tax entity ceased to be referred to as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax periods from the end of the period on which it submitted the tax return on the basis of which it was classified as a VDS, its net turnover for the tax period fell below the stated limit.</seg>
<seg id="506">A tax entity was not allowed to be removed from the VDS register without carrying out a tax audit of at least one tax for one tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were audited at least every five years until the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax entity must be carried out at least every two years and the chosen subsequent procedure must eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="509">The audit of the FÚ is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator usually chooses several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The VDS were audited by specialised audit departments, which are set up at 13 FUs in total, or by the staff of the audit departments of the locally competent FUs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The specialised audit departments carry out tax audits within the remit set by the Director of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities operating in unusual and specific fields of business;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities where carrying out a tax audit is technically and extremely time-consuming;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with a branched territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities connected in chains and networks where there is a suspicion of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified enticement of excessive deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax audits carried out by specialised audit departments of the FUs and the results of these audits are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, which consists in the establishment of a specialised Tax Office with nationwide coverage for selected tax entities (i.a. for legal entities set up for the purpose of business which have a turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Inspection of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT inspections of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax inspections in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • the regulations on tax inspections (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">The German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory control provisions are enshrined in sections 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax Control on Site. These articles enshrine in particular the rules on the admissibility of tax control on site (i.e. on the premises of an undertaking), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules on the allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of the control notice, the control principles, the obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and the prerequisites for carrying out the final examination and communication of the control report.</seg>
<seg id="526">Tax control on site is carried out by the responsible tax authorities (section 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Governance Act According to section 5.1, point 1, in conjunction with section 19 of the Act, participation in tax controls on site by the tax authorities is compulsory for the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The authorities involved agree with each other on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it chooses be subject to an inspection at a time it determines.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case, it may declare the rules for the conduct and content of the inspection at the premises of those companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Tax inspection regulations Under Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German abbreviation BpO 2000) have been approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament in which the governments of the Länder are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative regulations apply to the on-the-spot check carried out by the tax authorities of the Länder and by the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">The undertakings are classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large undertakings are subject to subsequent inspection (Article 4.2 of the BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">Under Article 33.1 of the BpO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in the BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, the following guidelines set out an additional methodology for the tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Uniform manual for special VAT controls in Germany ;</seg>
<seg id="539">• USLO manual, which sets out the methodology for using data on intra-Community business relations kept in the VIES system;</seg>
<seg id="540">• ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• Work aids for various and special objects.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different thresholds depending on the type of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The data is published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to be inspected - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular inspection intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">As a general rule, inspections of large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Inspections are usually announced, including VAT inspections.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that during the inspection, inspections are carried out definitively mainly on income tax, excise tax and VAT - i.e. inspections of all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT inspections can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangements of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by inspections usually varies between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 foresees a control period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes of the company are subject to inspection.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of VDS inspections carried out, but focused on management issues in order to obtain an overview of how the tax administrations manage the issue of VAT inspections at VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from the tax administrations on the areas they consider essential for managing this issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses are available to the management of the tax administrations regarding the VAT inspection at VDS?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against VAT fraud and VAT control in general?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such a distinction with the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between control designed to fight VAT fraud and general VAT control.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT controls (in relation to the time period of the audited transactions)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: The records of the timeliness of the questioning with relevance for intra-community acquisitions of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, the information recorded in the ADIS system also includes data of the type of time the questioning took.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors only contain information on the average time of the last inspection (information on the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This data does not provide an overview of the selected inspection periods with regard to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT inspectors focus on the most recent tax assessment period; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the statistics produced at federal level for special VAT inspection units do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• There are any statistics or records on the nature of the tax revenues additionally generated, broken down e.g. according to the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where a tax entity has unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of outstanding additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of additional tax assessed broken down by type of tax, by the number of tax entities audited and by the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigations, complaints procedures) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Time data and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics on general debts are also kept broken down by type of tax, but not by the declared tax or the tax determined by the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not distinguish between the above criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Moreover, the majority of tax administrations visited do not distinguish between these differences either.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are inspection areas registered which generate high additional revenues?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administration has the right to select tax payers for verification on the basis of criteria which can be linked to the selected indicators in the special sections of the ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">It follows that the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must record their increased tax (VAT) liability if it exceeds a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the increased tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- The VDS claim an unjustified right to deduct input tax on supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity pursuant to Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which have been used for representation pursuant to Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements laid down in Section 73(1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- The VDS did not declare output VAT pursuant to Section 21(1) of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It has been established that there are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">It follows that the uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings relating to VAT are not separately registered by the Länder insofar as they result from the tax inspections of the VDS.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder have to enter their increased tax (VAT) liability if it exceeds a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of the control areas from which a high "return" results and draw the consequences for the management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they launch nationwide audits focusing on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">The uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection units do not provide data on the audit areas from which a high "return" results.</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the process of analysis as well as on case management in terms of materiality.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax offices provide special information, but its use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">The differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of data from the tax inspections carried out as well as data from the financial statements - balance sheet and profit and loss statements.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same is true of VAT control analysis and management in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">This makes it more difficult to carry out these tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, the philosophy of Germany places more emphasis on the selection of individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="612">Therefore, the risk management components will be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">Both SAIs agree that the Member States should be able to ensure adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help to reduce the shortfall in VAT revenues.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the revenue from VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will also improve.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel controls of VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">Both SAIs got to know each other better the systems in place in the following areas: • intra-community transactions; • VAT risk management, especially with regard to the selection of transactions with a propensity to risk; • assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; and • VAT control of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to the mutual cooperation, differences in the strategies for detecting cases of VAT fraud as well as differences in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration were revealed in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="621">Control findings have been compared and best practices have been identified on the basis of them.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to start a discussion on approaches and strategies within the Member States, among them at the level of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communiqué</seg>
<seg id="625">The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
