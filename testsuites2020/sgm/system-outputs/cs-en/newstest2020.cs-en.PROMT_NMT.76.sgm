<seg id="1">Report on the results of parallel checks on the administration of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted material informs about the progress and results of the parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic Control Authority, which focused on the administration of Value Added Tax Exchange System (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so revenues from value added tax affect not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the progress of tax administrations in examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of VIES enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of value added tax payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by such payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mismatch between data in the VIES system and data in the VAT return filed by the payer should alert the tax administrator to suspicious cases and allow detection of tax evasion or fraud.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefit of the parallel checks was not only the exchange of information on the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax, but in particular the examination of the use of the VIES system in checking the application of the right to value added tax in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The knowledge gained in the implementation of parallel controls is beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in the implementation of further parallel checks in cooperation with the audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the results of parallel checks on the administration of value added tax for the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of control: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of tax authorities' procedures for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and the performance of VIES tasks for the exchange of information between EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic ("SAO, Czech Republic") and the Czech Audit Office of the Republic ("SAO SR") concluded on 12.9.2005 the Surveillance Cooperation Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of the parallel control actions "Value Added Tax Administration," included in the SAO Control Plan for 2005 under No. 05/19 and "Control of the Tax Procedure control and enforcement of VAT on value added and tasks under the VIES system on exchange of funds by Member States, " included in the SAO's audit plan under No 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel control actions were coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The result of the joint coordinated control was developed within the meaning of European Enforcement Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent specified by the Treaty and drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The purpose of the coordinated inspection was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between the taxpayers of value added tax from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic") and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Slovak Republic").</seg>
<seg id="20">Both parties contractually undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the Value Added Tax Information Exchange System (VIES) and data on requests received and sent to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Czech Republic, the control was carried out by the state budget department and the territorial unions of central Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: The Financial Office in Mladá Split, Tax Office in Cologne, Tax Office in Teplice, Tax Office in Karlovy Vary, Tax Office in Tábor, Financial Office Brno III, Tax Office in Znojmo, Tax Office in Zlín, Tax Office in Šumperk, Tax Office in Ostrava I, Tax Office for Prague 7 and Tax Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">The control on the territory of the SR was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with Exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 9 selected tax offices: Tax department Bratislava I, Tax department Komárno, Tax department Trenčín, Tax department Prievidza, Tax department Prievidza</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of checks:</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of the parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of the financial and tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") after the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the Single Internal Market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "the EU") and to examine the use of the electronic information system VIES, in particular when checking the application of the VAT exemption claim.</seg>
<seg id="27">The controlled period of coordinated control was the period from 1.5.2004 to 30.6.2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions In EU Member States, an electronic VIES system is introduced to enable tax administrations to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and to verify in the country of destination whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.</seg>
<seg id="29">VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The examination identified differences of national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and SR in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">The aggregated reports shall indicate the delivery values of the goods to other EU Member States, the values of the services provided shall not be included in the summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Data from summary reports filed by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they compare with data on deliveries of goods to other EU Member States listed in VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">The tax authorities transmit data from summary reports to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="34">In SR, data from summary reports filed by Slovak payers at tax offices are only transferred to electronic form and processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of SR (Customs).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of supplies of goods and the value of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which allows to compare the values listed in the aggregated reports with the value of supplies of goods according to the VAT return and to identify any differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, the values of the goods and services supplied to other EU Member States are aggregated on the common line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">Consequently, in SR, the system does not allow to automatically identify differences between the values of delivery of goods according to tax returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate reporting of the value of supplies of goods in VAT tax returns enables the data comparison results to be used to check the VAT exemption for supplies to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">The received data from the summary reports filed by payers in other EU Member States are processed into Customs and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods indicated by the payers from the Czech Republic or SR in the VAT tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences will be examined.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which quantified differences between the values of delivery and acquisition of goods must be examined by the tax administrators and transmits the list of these cases to the local tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="42">This ensures that, for the most significant derogations, it will be checked whether the VAT was declared at the correct level when the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="43">The audit also highlighted some problems in the VAT management system due to the different reporting of intracommunity transactions (i.e. delivery and acquisition of goods by payers from different EU Member States):</seg>
<seg id="44">Summary reports are made in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and dispatching data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reducing the period for which summary reports are submitted to one month, together with reducing the time limit for processing, would allow earlier access to VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="46">The tax authorities could thus more effectively verify whether VAT was declared at the correct level in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the same time, the submission of VAT returns and summary declarations for the same tax period (month) would allow for a faster verification of whether the payer has reported in both the aggregated report and the VAT return the same value of the delivery of goods to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="48">Differences between the delivery values reported by EU payers and the acquisition values reported by payers from the Czech Republic and SR were due, among other things, to different reporting of intracommunity and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="49">These included, for example, the presentation of advances received in summary reports or the reporting of intracommunity deliveries in the supplier's summary report in a different quarter than intracommunity acquisitions in the purchaser's VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">A harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the national tax administrations more effective.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also aimed at examining selected intracommunity transactions between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">Together, 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, where there were doubts about their implementation or suspected tax evasion on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR have identified among others the following:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities have declared in their VAT returns, for the purpose of unduly obtaining excessive VAT deduction, intracommunity transactions which have not actually taken place;</seg>
<seg id="55">tax entities reported intracommunity deliveries in the context of carousel transactions that deliberately reduced the value of supplies multiple times in order to draw excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">suppliers reported in their VAT returns and summary reports intracommunity supplies of exempt goods to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not grant tax on acquired goods;</seg>
<seg id="57">suppliers have made intracommunitary supplies of VAT-exempt goods to tax entities which have not been registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="58">In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been taxed in the supplier's country;</seg>
<seg id="59">suppliers reported intracommunity supplies in their VAT returns at a higher value than the intracommunity acquisition declared by the purchasers, and in some cases VAT was declared incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="60">The knowledge gained in the control action showed that the VIES system provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrations should pay particular attention to the rigorous examination of the differences between data reported by VAT payers and data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax procedures.</seg>
<seg id="62">Issue of value added tax after Czech and Slovak accession to the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On 1.5.2004 the Czech Republic and SR became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">Internal borders and border controls on intra-EU movements of goods have been abolished after EU accession.</seg>
<seg id="66">The VAT administrator was by 30 April 2004 the competent financial and tax office, with the exception of imports of goods and occasional bus services in the country where the tax administrator was the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In connection with the adoption of the new Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter "Act No. 235/2004 Coll.") and Act No. 222/2004 Z. z., on value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 222/2004 Z. z. ") the VAT administration transferred from customs offices to financial and tax offices when purchasing goods and services (formerly imported) from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="68">By delivering the goods in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of goods as owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">The delivery of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the delivery of goods that have actually been shipped or transported to another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="70">According to the provisions of Section 64 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. this is an exempt taxable transaction with a right to deduct VAT when the goods are delivered to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="71">For the delivery of goods in SR according to the provisions of Section 8 of Act No 222/2004 Z. z. considers the supply of tangible property to change ownership.</seg>
<seg id="72">The supply of goods shall also be deemed to involve the transfer of goods owned by a taxable person from the country to another Member State where such goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.</seg>
<seg id="73">According to the provisions of Section 43 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z. the supply of goods from the country to another Member State shall be exempt from VAT where the purchaser is a person identified for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="74">By acquiring goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic according to the provisions of Section 16 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of goods dispatched or transported to the purchaser by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Czech payer purchases goods at a price excluding VAT and is obliged in the Czech Republic to declare VAT according to the provisions of Section 25 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., and in fulfilment of the conditions laid down in Section 73 of this Act he is entitled to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">The acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic from another EU Member State is in the Slovak Republic according to the provisions of Section 11 of Law No. 222/2004 Z. z. the acquisition of the right to dispose as an owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported by the purchaser by the supplier or the purchaser, or for their account, to the territory of another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="77">The tax liability in the SR is incurred by the payer when acquiring goods from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of Act No. 222/2004 Z.z.</seg>
<seg id="78">According to the provisions of Section 49 of Act No 222/2004 Z, the payer can. z. deduct VAT if the tax is applied to the acquisition of goods domestically from another Member State in accordance with the provisions of Sections 11 and 11a of this Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">Triangular business is understood according to Section 17 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., or Section 45 of Act No. 222/2004 Z. z. a transaction concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States, the subject of which is the supply of the same goods between the three.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intracommunity transactions mean the supply and acquisition of goods between VAT payers from different EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total volumes of intracommunity transactions between the Czech Republic and SR are shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="82">VIES</seg>
<seg id="83">In order to control the application of the VAT exemption right to intracommunity supplies of goods, a system of exchange of VAT information has been established within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes an electronic VIES system that allows EU tax administrations to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and vice versa whether the purchaser has properly declared and taxed the goods acquired.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each Member State shall develop its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">National systems work on a common principle and are interconnected through the EU Common Communication Network (CCN); see diagram below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was connected to the automated tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "ADIS"), in SR to the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "APV DIS").</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by financial and tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in the administration of taxes and charges.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU Member State receives information on tax entities that it would not be able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation is to combat tax evasion and tax losses.</seg>
<seg id="93">Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State, within its internal organisational structure, establishes a central unit in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the administration of VAT, the Central Liaison Office.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance - Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration (hereinafter referred to as "MF Customs") has been established, performs the tasks resulting from international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The function of the Customs Office in SR is carried out by the Tax Directorate of SR, Department of International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as "DR Customs").</seg>
<seg id="96">These departments inter alia communicate with EU foreign administrations in particular in the field of information exchange within the VIES system, exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of the EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, verification of tax identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as "VAT creditors") in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">In order to verify an intracommunity transaction or to obtain other information related to a particular tax entity, the financial and tax authorities send requests for information to the EU via the MF Customs and DR Customs.</seg>
<seg id="98">Through these requests, they receive information from the requested Member States that they can use to correct the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests for information are sent mostly in electronic form between EU Member State Customs using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was focused mainly on the examination of selected intracommunity transactions between the two countries and on the level of use of information obtained through international cooperation by financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">The SAO, the Czech Republic requested the SAO to examine in 30 cases commercial transactions between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">SAO SR requested the SAO, Czech Republic to examine in 10 cases commercial transactions between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">The examination of intracommunity transactions revealed:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, the Czech Republic requested the SAO SR to examine the tax administration procedure, to which a reply to the request for information was sent.</seg>
<seg id="107">The Slovak Tax Office requested the delivery of goods (footwear) in the third quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer totalling SK 2,847 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="108">The Tax Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer indicated the acquisition of goods of this value only in an additional VAT return and delivered the same goods to Slovak tax entities worth CZK 2,550 by the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="109">On the basis of international cooperation between the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the local tax authority fully recognised the Slovak supplier as entitled to an excessive deduction of VAT incurred, inter alia, on the basis of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">This tax office did not provide information about the suspected reexportation to the local tax authorities of the relevant customers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="111">This will give rise to further examination of commercial activities in connection with possible carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">Through the SCAC form the Czech tax administrator requested an examination of the delivery of the technology line to SR totalling CZK 4,850 in the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax procedure carried out in SR showed that only part of the technological line was supplied. The components totalling CZK 3,395 thousand were not delivered.</seg>
<seg id="115">The SAO SR found during the examination of this case that the VAT on the taxable transactions made was declared by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850 in the VAT return (hereinafter referred to as "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">The SAO, Czech Republic also found that the Czech taxpayer reported excessive VAT deduction of CZK 655 thousand for that quarter in its DAP, resulting from the application of the VAT deduction on the purchase of this technology line from another domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="117">On the basis of the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities established a business relationship for the purpose of unduly obtaining an excess VAT deduction, questioned the taxable transactions and did not recognise the Czech taxpayer's part of the right to deduct CZK 647 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">In 2004, the Slovak tax administrator applied to the Czech taxpayer by means of the SCAC form for verification of the supply of goods (copying machines) in the value of SK 24,246 in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="120">In November 2002, the Slovak payer purchased these goods from another tax entity worth Sk. 29,667 and subsequently sold them to a Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity applied excessive VAT deduction for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="122">The tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax entity does not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not submit the DAP for the 4 quarter of 2002 or for the subsequent period.</seg>
<seg id="123">SAO SR found that the Slovak tax administration did not recognise, on the basis of the result of the tax check, an overcompensation of SK 5,541 000 applied in DAP for the month 11/2002 and established a tax liability of SK 1,750 000.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, the tax entity was not granted an exemption from VAT on exports of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an order from the MF Customs to verify the value of the goods acquired for Q3 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire from SR goods (diluent) worth 3,767 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="128">This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, DAP did not file and the VAT for the months 7 to 12/2004 was calculated from the official authority of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator requested a SCAC form to verify whether the supplies of goods from SR to the Czech Republic took place, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In reply, the Slovak local tax office sent a copy of the invoice, consignment notes and an invitation to pay the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">SAO SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with a right to deduct VAT on this supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administrator evaluated the response to the request for information received from the SR as evidence that the company acquired goods from another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the basis of further investigation, the tax authority in the Czech Republic will request a review of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">The Slovak company supplied goods (woodpecker products) to an American company, which stored these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of this free zone was indicated on the invoices as the consignee of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, for example, an American company purchased from a Slovak payer a wooden tile worth USD 57,600 (at a unit price of USD 100/unit), which it placed in a free zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, the company transferred the property rights to the goods to a Swiss company worth USD 14,400 (unit price USD 25/unit) and the goods were exported back to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the area of the free zone on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax administrator initiated tax checks on the supplier of goods for suspected carousel transactions in the various tax years 2004 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="141">Examination of transactions was requested by the Czech local tax administrators using several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">The individual replies gradually created a picture of business and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in carousel business.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO SR, found that these trade relations deliberately resulted in a gradual multiple depreciation of the value of goods.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the information obtained, the Tax Directorate of SR concluded that in this case carousel trade is free pricing (i.e. the import of underserved goods and its overvaluation by domestic companies located in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a breach of the VAT Act in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="145">In the current legislation, the excessive deduction of VAT to export companies cannot be avoided as they fulfil all the conditions of the Act on VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">Registration for VAT was cancelled at the date of 12.7.2005.</seg>
<seg id="148">On 27.10.2005, on the basis of a voluntary application for VAT registration, the entity became again a taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Czech taxpayer entered in DAP for the month of 8/2005 (i.e. the period in which he was not a VAT payer) the value of the acquisition of goods from SR amounting to CZK 1,174 thousand and claimed the VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to the delivery of goods by the Slovak payer amounting to Sk 1,530 thousand, which the Slovak payer indicated in the DAP as the delivery of goods to another EU Member State with a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax administrator requested to verify the delivery by means of the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier did not demonstrate how the goods delivered to the Czech Republic were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the Czech taxpayer does not cooperate with the tax administrator and does not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the local tax administrator for the purpose of examining the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">The Slovak payer entered in the summary report for Q3 2004 the delivery of goods worth 956 thousand Sk to the tax entity from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="156">The Czech subject's DIČ was flawed by the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="157">Verification in the payer database revealed that such VAT was never allocated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to the invoices issued by the Slovak payer, the Company carried out electrical assembly works on real estate in the Czech Republic. It was not the delivery of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced without VAT as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax administrator requested that these facts be verified using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="161">The SAO, Czech Republic found out by inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the tax entity listed on the invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not grant tax on the received services from the Slovak entity and did not grant tax on the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">Neither local investigations nor tax checks have been carried out on the Czech entity, its current whereabouts are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity had become a VAT payer by law.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax check for the 1 to 4 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">The Slovak payer entered in the summary report for Q3 2004 the delivery of goods worth 1,055 thousand Sk to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, electrical assembly works were carried out on real estate in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="168">It was not the delivery of goods from SR to the Czech Republic, but the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax administrator requested that these facts be verified using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="170">The SAO, Czech Republic found out by inquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of delivery and that a local investigation was carried out to verify the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in Q3 2004.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that in this case it was not actually the acquisition of goods, but the acquisition of services, which was also reported by the Czech entity in the proper DAP.</seg>
<seg id="172">The Tax Office also found that the Czech entity did not deduct VAT in the correct amount for the third quarter of 2004 due to poor VAT calculation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tax entity shall submit an additional DAP.</seg>
<seg id="174">By enquiry with the local tax office, the SAO discovered that the Slovak payer had erroneously indicated the provision of the service in the summary report and would be subject to a tax check for the first to fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">The Czech tax entity voluntarily registered as a VAT payer from 10. 3. 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For the first quarter of 2004, DAP submitted a high turnover in both input and output.</seg>
<seg id="178">The local tax administrator initiated the tax procedure, the body did not cooperate with the tax administrator, so due to suspicion of involvement in the carousel trade a VAT of CZK 0 was charged.</seg>
<seg id="179">Another DAP was no longer filed by this payer.</seg>
<seg id="180">Due to non-compliance with the statutory obligations, his VAT registration was cancelled on 4.1.2005.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to VIES data, this entity was to acquire goods worth SK 7,846 thousand from the Slovak payer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="182">In order to verify the execution of these transactions, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The SAO SR found out by inquiry with the local tax office that the Czech company executive denied in witness testimony the execution of the examined transactions and questioned the authenticity of its signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">On the basis of a tax proceeding in the Slovak Republic, the intracommunitary supply to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was called into question.</seg>
<seg id="185">The payer will not be recognised as entitled to VAT exemption and will be charged VAT on the above amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire goods from SR in the first quarter of 2005 (working clothes) totalling SK 39,970 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="188">In this quarter, the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only in DAP for the month of 3/2005, totalling CZK 11,292 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="189">The local tax administrator carried out local investigations with the entity for the purpose of examining the data in this DAP.</seg>
<seg id="190">As the Company did not submit any documents or otherwise substantiate the taxable transactions, the tax administrator charged it CZK 0 on 9 June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="191">Due to doubts regarding the acquisition of goods, the tax administrator sent two requests for information to the Slovak Republic in May 2005.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the reply to the requests for information, the tax administrator in SR had doubts about the implementation of business cases as well as about the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent an initiative to DR CLO to carry out simultaneous checks with the Czech tax administration, which would be carried out on stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated inspection, the local tax administrator carried out further inquiries in the Czech Republic concerning the Czech entity and at the same time an investigation was carried out by the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of being involved in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions in goods (working clothes) were carried out between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak payer No. 1 supplied goods to Czech payer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No. 3, who delivered them back to SR payer No. 4 (see scheme No. 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">(A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech payer No. 2 was to acquire goods (working garments) worth CZK 4,847 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the Slovak payer No. 1 and 17,050 thousand in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the local tax administrator sent a request for information to SR on 25. 5. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="203">In reply, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the implementation of business cases and about the payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">On 8. 6. 2005, a request for information was received from the MF Customs Office of the Slovak Republic concerning goods worth 16,575 thousand Sk, which was to be delivered by Slovak payer No. 1 to Czech payer No. 2 in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak party requested to verify whether the Czech payer No. 2 actually accepted the goods, admitted in DAP and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">The official record produced by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that the Czech payer No. 2 no longer resides at an address registered in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although they were VAT payers with a monthly tax period, DAP submitted for the quarterly tax period.</seg>
<seg id="208">In view of this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not calculate VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The taxable transaction between the Slovak payer No. 1 and the Czech payer No. 2 mentioned in the application of SK 16,575 could not be verified in view of the above.</seg>

<seg id="212">Czech payer No. 3, engaged in the purchase and sale of passenger cars, submitted DAP for the tax period 1 and 2/2005, in which he reported delivery of goods (working clothes) to Slovak payer No. 4 totalling T CZK 21,935.</seg>
<seg id="213">These work clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No. 3 from Czech payer No. 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The local tax office sent a request for information to the Slovak Republic, in particular to verify whether the Slovak payer No. 4 acquired goods worth CZK 1,025 thousand from the Czech payer No. 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935 thousand in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="215">The reply to this request for information received from the SR showed that in DAP 12/2004 the Slovak payer No 4 reported zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in DAP 1 and 2/2005 the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State only amounted to SK 1,193 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="216">Slovak taxpayer No 4 did not respond to the call for tax documents for the tax period from 10/2004 to 3/2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The local investigation carried out in the SR revealed that the company was not present at the address listed in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">The reply further stated that this payer fulfils all the characteristics of the so-called "lost company" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent an initiative to DR CLO to carry out simultaneous checks with the Czech tax administration, which would be carried out on interested tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or disprove the existence of goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be charged according to the outcome of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case is also dealt with by the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="223">Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="224">In preparation of the parallel control actions, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, Czech Republic with representatives of the SAO SR took place in the first half of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">Participants of this meeting were familiar with the VAT legislation in both countries and the integration of the electronic VIES system into national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The negotiations resulted in a specification of the extent of cooperation and the conditions for sampling.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that cooperation will focus on the following areas: (a) verification of the validity and accuracy of VAT creditors in the Czech Republic and SR in intracommunity supplies; b) examination of data on intracommunity acquisitions specified in the DAP payer in the Czech Republic using information from summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of SR payers contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia on business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="228">It was also agreed that the collection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out following the volume of intracommunity supplies between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and SR via the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intracommunitary transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure for processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic during intracommunity delivery and acquisition of goods shows the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intracommunitary supply</seg>
<seg id="232">If the VAT payer makes an intracommunity delivery, he is obliged to lodge an SH by the 25th day following the end of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">The payer in the Czech Republic gives summary information in SH about the supplies of goods to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">The taxpayer in the SR is obliged to enter into the SH the value of the exempt goods delivered from the country to other EU Member States for the period of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">Data on the value of the delivered goods are given in the SH in the Czech and Slovak currencies, broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their tax credits, under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Service data shall not be entered in SH.</seg>
<seg id="237">If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has given incorrect data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="238">If a payer in the SR finds that the information provided in the SH was incomplete or incorrect, he shall submit a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for submission of the SH, after the expiry of that period he shall submit an additional SH.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system allows the exchange of information on the registration data of VAT registered payers in EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="240">Payers from the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic can verify whether the customer's tax account is registered in the EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="241">Data from filed SHS are grouped on the MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The total value of all deliveries is created for each purchaser's tax receipt and the performance code of all its Czech and Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">The data from the L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intracommunity transactions between the Czech Republic and SR (from L1QD files) is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system in another Member State detects erroneous purchaser's tax rates in the sent files, it will generate a so-called  report that contains all the wrong TACs indicating the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This message is subsequently sent to the MF CLO or DR CLO.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect TP, the TP is not registered or has never been allocated in that country, the purchaser with a specific TP was not a VAT payer in that quarter, the registration for VAT of the purchaser was terminated during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the Czech Republic, the MF transmits data from received reports to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="249">If the incorrect EU tax rate is used in one of the SH lines sent or subsequent SH, the ADIS system generates the so-called "VAT ID Notification of Doubt" at the competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office will verify whether the delivery to a VAT-registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification into the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the SR, DR Customs will process all the messages O_MCTL in the VIES system and send them electronically to the local tax authorities together with the identification of the tax payers who have reported erroneous taxes in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax authorities subsequently invite the payer to submit an additional SH and the tax office will verify the delivery of the goods to the payer when reporting the invalid TP in the filed SH.</seg>
<seg id="253">The following table shows the number of incorrect taxes relating to intracommunity transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="254">Out of a total of 41,728 Czech taxpayers, listed in the SH of Slovak payers in the period from Q2 2004 to Q1 2005, 929 were incorrect TAC, i.e. 2.23%.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number 62,997 DIČ Slovak payers listed in the SH of Czech payers in the same period, 416 were incorrect TAC, i.e. 0.66%.</seg>
<seg id="256">When reporting intracommunity transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, Czech taxpayers reported on average fewer incorrect VAT payments in their SH.</seg>
<seg id="257">When examining the activities of the financial and tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations.</seg>
<seg id="258">For example:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in the 4 quarter of 2004 when asked by the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, a report was subsequently generated O_MCTL due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">The investigation revealed that the termination of the marketing authorisation did not take place until 1.1.2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- SAO SR further found that 6 tax entities submitted SHS in which the incorrect TTC was indicated, but the reports O_MCTL did not include these TTs.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the SR, filed by the SH shall be transferred to the tax authorities in electronic form and data from which shall be sent to the DR Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="263">After the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, DR CUSTOMS will send to the relevant tax authorities the so-called breakdown of errors in SH filed by tax entities for the respective quarters.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO has compared data on the incidence of erroneous data in the SH to 26.7.2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and to 2.2.2006 (i.e. data processed after the completion of the inspection).</seg>
<seg id="265">The data comparison shall include the following table.</seg>
<seg id="266">From the above data, it is apparent that the SAO SR control not only affected the reduction of the number of SHs with an erroneous TP (by an average of SH 199 per quarter), but also the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH (by an average of 431 errors per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the Czech Republic, the value of intracommunity deliveries listed by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intracommunity deliveries indicated by this payer in the quarterly SH.</seg>
<seg id="268">ADIS automatically indicates differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="270">SAO, Czech Republic found that audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the SH and DAP values was CZK 537,231.</seg>
<seg id="272">As of Q3 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values listed in SH and DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intracommunity supplies according to SH as a match and set it in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For payers with a large volume of intracommunity deliveries for one quarter, 0,5% of the value represents a significant amount, so tax administrations should not set the SH and DAP's compliance in these cases without clarifying the reasons for the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">Eg. The tax administrator set a match for the value difference of CZK 1,561 without examination.</seg>
<seg id="275">The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH was filed by payers for each calendar quarter within 25 days after the end of this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">Tax administrators were unable to compare the intracommunity delivery values specified in these DAPs with the SH values for the first two months of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax administrators found out about any inconsistency of data in the DAP and SH only when the tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was charged. returned.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intracommunitary acquisition</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intracommunity transactions carried out within EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="281">In the Czech Republic, received data from SH filed by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) are processed by MF Customs.</seg>
<seg id="282">During the processing the data are calculated at the minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the value of the acquisition indicated by the Czech payers in the DAP for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The value of the acquisition of goods reported by payers in the DAP should be within the minimum and maximum converted value of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">If the value reported in the DAP is lower than the L1min value, a so-called verification order is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="285">Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a reminder of problematic tax entities and are forwarded to locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="286">The number of verification orders concerning audited financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities in 33 cases did not investigate irregularities in intracommunity acquisitions, to which the orders for verification were submitted.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the SH values of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases was at least CZK 148,319 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, the Czech Republic selected 533 files of tax entities for which the audited tax authorities received an order of verification from the MF Customs.</seg>
<seg id="290">The check identified the following most common causes of differences between the values specified in the purchaser's DAP and the supplier's SH: on the purchaser's side (Czech payer) in 263 cases, the purchaser did not indicate the acquisition of goods in the proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer declared the acquisition of goods in a different tax period than the one in which he was liable to tax, in 6 cases the purchaser entered the value of the goods in the wrong DAP line, on the supplier's side (EU payer) in 88 cases, EU payers included in their SH the values of the services provided to the Czech payer, of these, 54 were SR payers, in 39 cases suppliers have included in the SH the supply of goods in a different tax period than the Czech Republic purchasers in their DAP, in 22 cases, suppliers reported incorrect Czech payer's VAT in SH, In 16 cases, suppliers reported incorrect delivery values in SH, in 12 cases suppliers have included in the SH the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1.5. 2004, In 5 cases, suppliers have included in the SH the value of the advance received.</seg>
<seg id="291">On the part of SR payers, the value of the services provided was most often incorrectly included in SH.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases have been identified in audited financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="293">Eg. when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974 thousand was created by the fact that the Slovak payer introduced the 1 of the provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic) to SH for the 2005 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of the received advances in SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers reported in SH received advances from Czech payers, resulting in an order to verify the difference of CZK 3,580 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="295">Orders to verify acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In cases where subsequent changes in SH data occur in EU Member States, such as the change of the customer of goods in the Czech Republic or the increased value of the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Since the VIES does not automatically alert those changes, the local tax administrator does not need to know the goods purchaser without any other suggestion of the facts relevant for the correct determination of the tax liability of the goods acquired and there is a high likelihood of VAT evasion.</seg>
<seg id="298">The audit of the SAO, Czech Republic found that this situation occurred for example in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">Slovak payer in SH for Q2 2004 reported the value of delivery of goods for Czech payer amounting to 1,504 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 1.2.2005, the Tax Office sent a request for information to the local Czech payer because the Czech payer granted the purchase of goods totalling only CZK 425 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer submitted an additional SH on 1.3.2005 in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand Sk and by increasing the value of the goods delivered to another Czech payer from 194 thousand Sk to 1,160 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak payers reported in their SH for the second quarter of 2004 intracommunity delivery to Czech payers totalling SK 10,240 thousand (i.e. CZK 8,183 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech buyers did not report intracommunity acquisitions at DAP.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of an international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer who was not mentioned in the SH filed by Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the first quarter of 2005, Slovak payers increased the value of intracommunity deliveries for this Czech payer by a total of SK 10,240 thousand during the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="306">In view of the above, the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in DAP for Q2 2004, even if the actual purchaser did not comply with the obligation to declare intracommunity acquisitions for this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, Czech Republic found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the above mentioned Czech payer was additionally charged VAT for the tax years 5 and 6/2004 amounting to CZK 3,640 thousand and 3,305 thousand CZK for the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="308">It is clear from the above that tax administrations have had to examine not only differences arising from errors in the purchaser's DAP, but also differences due to different reporting of intracommunity and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="309">The harmonisation of the reporting conditions for this data would lead to a more efficient control activity of the tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In the SR, the APV DIS system allows to compare data on the value of the goods acquired through the VIES system from other EU Member States with data contained in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method used to compare the data is called the "MIN-MAX method."</seg>
<seg id="313">This method will convert the value of supplies of goods listed in SH to payers from other EU Member States at a minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">The MIN-MAX interval will be created, which is used for comparison with the value of acquisition of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.</seg>
<seg id="315">DR CUSTOMS shall send information to the tax administrations on the intracommunity acquisition values specified in the DAP and the EU VIES delivery values.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator decides which persons registered for VAT will be checked for the difference, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of data provided by DR CLO, the SAO has selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods from audited tax offices, of which 25 payers have acquired goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between the acquisition values obtained from the VIES system and those declared in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="318">The audit carried out by the SAO SR confirmed the fact that the tax administrations did not rigorously investigate the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data contained in the Slovak purchasers "DAP.</seg>
<seg id="319">As part of the audit, the SAO requested the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations on specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">During the audit of the SAO SR at the tax offices, 31 local investigations were completed.</seg>
<seg id="321">For Slovak companies with significant differences in MIN-MAX values in the acquisition of goods from EU Member States, the following facts were identified:</seg>
<seg id="322">In DAP 2004 Q4, the Slovak payer did not indicate the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The Tax Office found that the company from the Czech Republic reported this payer in SH for the fourth quarter of 2004 by mistake, while delivering goods worth CZK 19,184 thousand to another Slovak payer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, the Slovak company was to acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria worth MIN 682,692 thousand Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company submitted DAP for the given periods, in which it indicated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU amounting only to SK 480,599.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers to SH and DAP did not indicate intracommunity deliveries according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.</seg>
<seg id="328">In view of other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU countries, the tax administrator will request verification of the value of the goods delivered by means of SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not mention the acquisition of goods from EU Member States in DAP.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11 286 thousand Sk and MAX 11 845 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="331">A local investigation was carried out by the Tax Office and the inspection showed that no goods from EU Member States were acquired by the tax entity in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO SR recommended that the tax office request a verification of the supply of goods from EU Member States by means of a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="333">VIES recorded the delivery of goods for a Slovak customer worth MIN 557 thousand Sk and MAX 565 thousand Sk.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the DAP for the tax period from 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not declare any acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier from the Czech Republic on 10. 12. 2004 for material consumed in the repair of the hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO SR recommended that a tax check be carried out on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="337">During the audit of the SAO SR in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not terminate local investigations.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax check on tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax checks will be submitted by the tax authorities after their implementation by the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="340">These were, for example, the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="341">The Slovak purchaser did not provide any tax in DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the acquisition of goods from EU Member States and did not grant any tax for the tax period from 10 to 12/2004 and claimed an excess VAT deduction totalling SK 1,236 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out a local investigation which revealed that the tax entity acquired EUR 683 000 worth of goods from the Czech Republic (approximately SK 27,080 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="343">These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to a customs office in the town of Split, where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Slovak customer payer in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for EUR 683 000, which he did not mention in the DAP.</seg>
<seg id="345">For the tax entity, the tax administration carries out a tax check.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the acquisition data in the Slovak payer's DAP for Q3 2004 to Q1 2005 and the delivery data reported by EU Member State payers for each quarter totalled SK 4,800 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office found that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers from the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold them to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">The invoices were accompanied by export single declarations.</seg>
<seg id="349">The acquisition of goods in DAP was not indicated by the tax entity. According to the Company Executive, the goods in transit were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The taxpayer submitted no VAT records to the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">A tax check was initiated on the payer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International exchange of information level L3</seg>
<seg id="353">The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by locally competent tax administrations, which send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "JHA") or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as "SPI") relating to a particular tax entity or transaction via the MF to the CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="354">DR CUSTOMS to another EU Member State. The aim of the JHA is, for example, to demonstrate the execution of the transaction in the context of intracommunity transactions, examination of a certain TAC, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">The SPI is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">The maximum period for replying to the JHA was set out in Article 2 (1) of the basic Regulation. 8 of this Regulation for 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for admissibility of applications are laid down in the Commission Decision of 15.11.2004 of the European Communities, which provides that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the Ryanair must cover commercial transactions worth at least EUR 1,500 net of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">The requested authority may refuse to respond to a commercial transaction worth less than EUR 15,000 net of VAT if the RU relates to a transaction worth less than EUR 10.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure for handling incoming JORs by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of internal time limits set for processing at individual organisational levels, illustrates the following diagram.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the SR, the deadline for the discharge of the JHA by the tax authorities was set at 2 months so that the three-month period under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 could be respected.</seg>
<seg id="362">From 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005, the MF accepted a total of 29 JHA and 3 SPI.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of the 29 JHA received, 26 (i.e. 89.7%) were settled within a period of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were settled after that deadline.</seg>
<seg id="364">In the same period, DR CUSTOMS from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 JHA and 7 SPI.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of the 71 accepted JHA, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were settled within a specified period of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were settled after that period (for the other 2 cases it was not possible to determine the time limit of discharge from the submitted materials).</seg>

<seg id="368">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States have been examined, in particular in monitoring the application of the VAT exemption claim.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intracommunitary transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="371">By examining the selected transactions, it was found that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries detected cases of companies carrying out fictitious intracommunitarian commercial transactions in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not grant VAT on received supplies of goods at the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">The examination also identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">The audit also highlighted problems caused by different reporting of data on intracommunity supplies and acquisitions of goods in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="374">A harmonisation of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would make the control activities of the national tax administrations more effective.</seg>
<seg id="375">By examining the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system, it was found that the financial or tax authorities did not make sufficient use of all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="376">It was also found that the VIES system did not in all cases provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and the validity of the registration of tax entities for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="377">SAO SR compared data on the incidence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with data processed after the completion of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="378">It was clear from the comparison of these data that the SAO SR control had an effect not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with the erroneously mentioned TS, but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="379">In the event of irregularities in the reported SAO data, the SAO requested the tax authorities to carry out local investigations and, where appropriate, to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such an option under the applicable legislation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="381">The knowledge gained by the control action showed that VIES provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Given that there remains scope for tax evasion in this area, there is a need for increased attention to be paid to intracommunity transactions when administering VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">This information material gives an overview of the progress and results of the parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the General Audit Office of the Republic of Slovenia, which were focused on the area of value added management and excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Offices of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement in the control activity concluded in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of parallel control actions was selected in view of the fact that indirect taxes contribute significantly to the revenues of the national budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The design of the value added tax, enabling the excess deduction to be recovered, provides room for tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High rates of excise duties, especially on tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively throughout the European Union, a working group of VAT Working Groups has been set up by the supreme audit institutions of the Member States of the European Union, with the highest audit authorities of both countries actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of the audits can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in the joint effort to identify problems in the management of indirect taxes in order to limit the scope for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience and knowledge gained will be used in the framework of planned controls on indirect taxes, mainly aimed at involving the tax administrators of both countries in the VIES system, which can control the movement of goods between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on the results of the control of the administration of value added tax and excise duties for 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Control of the tax administrator's procedures for the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="18">On 11.2. 2004, a Contract for cooperation in control activities was concluded between the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the Czech Audit Office of the Republic (SAO SR). The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implementation of the parallel control actions "Value Added Tax and Excise Duty," included in the SAO's control plan for 2004 under No 04/07, and "Audit of the SAO's practice of the tax administrator in relation to the collection, control and enforcement of value added tax and other taxes," included in the SAO's control activity plan under No. 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooperation consisted of the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the Treaty and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the contract, both parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs database and from the files of tax entities maintained by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties could not obtain when controlling the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the relevant state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic"), the control was carried out by the state budget department and the territorial unions of southern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited persons were the Directorate-General of Customs and the 12 selected tax offices: Tax Office for Prague 1, Tax Office for Prague 3, Tax Office in České Budějovice, Tax Office in Frýdk-Místek, Tax Office in Hodonín, Tax Office in Jihlava, Tax Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, Tax Office in Kroměříz, Financial Office in Písko</seg>
<seg id="24">The inspection on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter "SR") was carried out by the SAO Section of Tax and Customs in cooperation with Exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:</seg>
<seg id="25">Tax department Bratislava for selected tax entities, Tax department Bratislava III, Tax department Trnava, Tax department Pu-breeding, Tax department Banská Bystrica I, Tax department Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax department Žilina I, Tax department Žilina II, Tax department Košice I and</seg>
<seg id="26">Control objective</seg>
<seg id="27">The aim of the audits was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of the financial and/or tax offices and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duties, focusing on the collection of these taxes in the import and export of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of SR and their subsequent verification in tax returns on the relevant financial and tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Recapitulation of control results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="32">Within the framework of international cooperation of the SAO, the SAO has transferred from the customs database of the Czech Republic 22,206 items of the Uniform Customs Declarations (hereinafter referred to as the "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and, conversely, the SAO has transmitted to the SAO from the customs database SR 30,221.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison was made between the printed JCD items from the Czech Customs Database and the SR Customs Database.</seg>
<seg id="34">Out of 5,883 selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic, 43% of related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 12 343 selected JCD items from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD items were assigned.</seg>
<seg id="36">Based on the unassigned items of the JCD, the financial and/or tax offices included a selection of files of tax entities for which the reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="37">Based on the exchange of information from the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and the financial and tax authorities, the implementation of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was verified in the territory of the other State.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SAO and the SAO SR carried out a joint pilot inspection at the border crossing point Old Hrozenkov - Drietoma, where both parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not identify deficiencies in the record of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">International cooperation enabled the examination of trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and highlighted weaknesses in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="42">In the field of international cooperation, the SAO and SAO control focused on imports and exports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, or other types of goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the basis of a review of the tax records of selected financial and tax authorities, the SAO requested verification of the realization of exports of goods reported at 40 JCD totalling CZK 15,301,093 and the SAO SR to verify exports at a statistical value of SK 56,989.</seg>
<seg id="44">The SAO and the SAO have identified, inter alia, the following:</seg>
<seg id="45">- commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the SR,</seg>
<seg id="46">- error in entering data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,</seg>
<seg id="47">- for certain exports from the Czech Republic, the corresponding imports to the SR have not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="48">In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of undue application of value added tax deductions,</seg>
<seg id="49">- tax entities have failed to comply with certain obligations laid down by law in the reporting of imports and exports in value added tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="50">- weaknesses have been identified in the activities of the financial and tax offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duties and in their cooperation with the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of value added tax and excise duties, international trade will continue to need to be addressed in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrations in the administration of value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">The basis for effective control of excise duties is control of the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and mutual exchange of information on import and export of goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Description of the situation in the field of value added tax and excise duties</seg>
<seg id="55">Value Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value added tax (VAT) was levied by the financial and/or tax authorities on taxable transactions effected domestically and by the customs authorities on importation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">The tax revenues were due to the difference between the tax liability collected and the excess VAT deductions recovered.</seg>
<seg id="58">VAT revenues at customs offices were given by the amount of their tax collected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The tax collected by the customs authorities, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, was reflected in the tax deductions applied to the financial and tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most financial and tax authorities, excessive VAT deductions exceeded tax obligations.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the flagship taxes in terms of revenue of the state budget, as it accounted for approximately 31% of the tax revenue of the Czech state budget in 2003 and approximately 42% of the tax revenue of the state budget of SR.</seg>
<seg id="62">The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic reached CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="63">The tax and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions refunded totalled CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">The total VAT collection in Slovakia totalled SK 83.8 billion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tax and customs authorities collected SK $187.0 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions were reimbursed totalling SK $103.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise duties</seg>
<seg id="67">The collection of excise duties (SPD) was carried out by the relevant financial and/or tax authorities and the customs authorities when importing products subject to SPD.</seg>
<seg id="68">SpD's share of state budget tax revenues in the Czech Republic was approximately 16% in 2003 and about 19% in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="69">The total collection of SPD collected in the Czech Republic by the financial and customs authorities in 2003 amounted to CZK 85.6 billion and in the Slovak Republic amounted to Sk 38.0 billion.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="71">Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR took place in two stages.</seg>
<seg id="72">The first stage included a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In the second stage, the results of this comparison were used to verify the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Preparation of the control action</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel checks of VAT and SPD was presented at a working meeting of representatives of SAO and SAO SR in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">A coordination meeting was held in November 2003, where the selection of commodities - the types of goods which posed a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax rules - was agreed, inter alia: - alcohol and spirits, tariff items Nos 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff items No.2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff subheadings No 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings No 8525,20,91,8525,20,99,8529,90,40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out: (a) from unassigned items found by comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and SR, (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports on a regular or one-off basis in large volumes, (c) based on findings from controls carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first stage, the JCD item assignment mechanism registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR was tested on the sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Subsequently, part of the exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other distillates denatured, of any alcoholic strength,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; distillates, liqueurs and other spirit drinks,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with cut-off ends), cigarillos and cigarettes of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essence),</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmitters containing reception equipment: For cellular network (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmitters containing reception equipment: Other,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.</seg>
<seg id="89">Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">The JCD entries from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were assigned to each other on the basis of the conformity of the individual paragraphs of the JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration mark of the vehicle carrying the cargo, date of crossing the national border, tariff entry, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and graphs.</seg>
<seg id="92">Inter alia, the fact that commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides made it difficult to assign individual imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="93">For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared in one export JCD were declared in the Slovak Republic for several import JCDs, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.</seg>
<seg id="94">Other factors that affected the success of the assignment were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial and tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority was given to certain tax entities that made imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which could not be identified in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, some tax entities were collected to verify the transactions reported in the VAT tax returns for which data on imports and exports between the Czech Republic and SR were found in both databases.</seg>
<seg id="98">Pilot control at the border crossing point Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma</seg>
<seg id="99">The border customs crossing for pilot inspection was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR.</seg>
<seg id="100">On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and SR, the use of checkpoints has been introduced at border crossing points between the Czech Republic and SR since 1.6.1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movements of commercial goods in the customs area and to create conditions for cross-comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The joint pilot inspection was carried out between 8.3.2004 and 26.3.2004 and aimed at verifying this customs control system.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure for the use of checkpoints at the Old Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing point:</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Weighing the vehicle, issuing the check sheet and giving it to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Weaning of the vehicle in the indicated sector in the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs discussion in the check-in hall by the Police of the Czech Republic, the Police of Slovakia, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="107">The check-in process was confirmed by individual components by stamping on the checklist.</seg>
<seg id="108">3) Attachment of the vehicle to the physical inspection area.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the certificate of inspection, JCD, or other documents to a customs official, as appropriate - checking the execution of all the prescribed acts and documents.</seg>
<seg id="110">Carrying out physical checks by the relevant constituents.</seg>
<seg id="111">Release of the vehicle from the customs compartment.</seg>
<seg id="112">Pozru: When the goods were imported into the Czech Republic, weighted vehicles were carried out directly by the staff of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="113">When the goods were imported into the SR, the weighted vehicles were carried out by staff of the authorised legal person.</seg>
<seg id="114">The vehicles were registered in computer records after weighing.</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Control sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="117">The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of Czech exports in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the export control sample is set out in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">Check sheets and their registration Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="120">When exporting from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, control sheets were issued and registered by the Slovak Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="121">The customs administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these checklists in the electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">Of the 453 items of the JCD, SAO SR tracked 256 cases of imports into the SR according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 items of the JCD were identified by the SAO SR in cooperation with the staff of the Drietoma Border Customs Crossing Point.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from SR to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">When exporting from SR to the Czech Republic, checklists were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">Out of a total of 339 items of JCD of the selected SAO control sample in cooperation with the staff of the border customs crossing point, Staré Hrozenkov assigned the corresponding registration numbers of the checkpoints to 295 items of JCD.</seg>
<seg id="126">The other 44 cases were identified in their register by the Drietoma Border Customs Crossing Point workers and confirmed the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="127">The audit of the SAO and SAO SR did not identify deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the border crossing point of Stará Hrozenkov-Drietoma.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4 Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the basis of customs administrations and financial and tax offices in the territory of the other state.</seg>
<seg id="130">For selected tax entities:</seg>
<seg id="131">- whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,</seg>

<seg id="151">The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO SR has identified in the customs database SR 13 JCD (50 items) the statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="153">The SLOVAK customs database failed to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCDs (9 items) totalling CZK 399,776.</seg>
<seg id="154">The competent tax authority in the SR verified these imports with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="155">The tax entity listed on the JCD as an importer in the SR stated in the local investigation that imports declared on the Czech export JCD were not realised.</seg>
<seg id="156">The SAO SR therefore requested the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax check on VAT and corporate tax for the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</seg>
<seg id="157">6. According to the Customs Database of the Czech Republic, the company involved in importing and selling cigarettes exported tobacco stickers with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="158">No exports were recorded in the 2002 and 2003 VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="159">The SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598 for verification.</seg>
<seg id="160">To 4 export JCDs (4 items) totalling CZK 2,246,860, the SAO SR identified in the customs database SR 7 JCD (7 items) a statistical value of SK 2,919,514.</seg>
<seg id="161">The export JCD (1 item) totalling CZK 224,738 could not be assigned to the corresponding imports in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="162">7. The software company did not declare exports of goods in the VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="163">According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630,198.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SAO selected 9 JCDs (9 items) for verification in the total statistical value of CZK 755,588.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the customs database of SR SAO SR, 8 JCDs (8 items) identified a statistical value of 915 601 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="166">The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68 286 could not be assigned corresponding imports in the SR customs database.</seg>
<seg id="167">In these cases, the customs database SR failed to identify the corresponding imports to 6 JCDs at a statistical value of CZK 692,800.</seg>
<seg id="168">Of which:</seg>
<seg id="169">- on 2 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the customs database of SR failed to identify the corresponding import JCD (see paragraphs 6 and 7).</seg>
<seg id="170">Due to a certain error in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify certain registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or an error in the tax identification number ("TIER").</seg>
<seg id="171">It is therefore not possible to state with certainty that these exports did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="172">- on 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were not proven at a statistical value of CZK 399,776 (see paragraph 5).</seg>
<seg id="173">In such cases, suspicion of fictitious export of goods for the purpose of undue application of the VAT deduction is justified.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services under the control of selected financial and tax authorities</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Control sample</seg>
<seg id="176">In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax authorities on imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the files of the tax entities were collected at the audited financial and tax offices in accordance with the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1st tax entities were collected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: (a) with the highest import volume, (b) with the highest amount of VAT, (c) with the highest export volume,</seg>
<seg id="178">Tax entities were collected from the financial and/or tax offices according to the amount: (a) VAT deductions applied on importation, (b) excessive VAT deductions applied, (c) the right to refund the SPD, (d) the VAT exemption applied on export,</seg>
<seg id="179">3 tax entities where the tax check has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="180">Sampling was carried out irrespective of the country of destination, focusing on risk commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risk commodities in 2002 and 2003 is given in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Control of the selected sample at the financial offices</seg>
<seg id="184">The SAO focused on:</seg>
<seg id="185">- the procedure of the financial authorities to verify the accuracy of VAT declared,</seg>
<seg id="186">- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,</seg>
<seg id="187">- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax offices with a view to comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the classification of goods or services, etc. comparison of data on the JCD and accompanying invoices with data in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- a comparison of VAT return data on transactions effected and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at the tax offices or in the customs database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- the method of verifying the right to VAT exemption when goods or services are exported abroad,</seg>
<seg id="190">- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services provided declared in VAT returns with the data from the customs database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The JCD database at the tax authorities contained only records of those imports and exports for which tax entities were obliged to place imports or exports on the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audited financial offices examined the files of tax entities which showed total imports totalling CZK 60,396,379 thousand in VAT returns in the years 2002 and 2003 and corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="193">In addition, the records of tax entities reporting exports totalling CZK 47,33,111 were checked in the 2002 and 2003 tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="194">Tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were examined, according to the Czech Customs Database in 2002 and 2003 imports into the Czech Republic from the Slovak Republic totalling CZK 3,759,352 thousand, VAT of CZK 767,607 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="195">The differences found between the records in the JCD database at the tax offices and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:</seg>
<seg id="196">- JCD items missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly by the Directorate-General of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">- for JCD items missing from the database of financial authorities, it has been verified that they are not cancelled documents,</seg>
<seg id="198">- for items of the JCD for which different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the financial authorities, they were requested by the Directorate-General of Customs of the Czech Republic to the relevant JCD in writing, including the invoices attached.</seg>
<seg id="199">The examination revealed that the JCD database at the tax offices did not contain, for example, records of import JCD totalling CZK 3,622 thousand and export JCD records totalling CZK 9,359 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences detected</seg>
<seg id="201">By comparing the JCD database at the tax authorities and the accumulated tax liabilities for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns of the selected sample, the following differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="202">Differences in values were mainly due to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- A time shift between the realization of imports and the application of the right to deduct VAT charged on imports of goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The taxpayer could claim a deduction for the importation of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax period during which the goods were placed under the relevant procedure or, in the case of temporary importation, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax period during which the scheme was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time shift between the realisation of exports and the moment when the tax entity received the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The taxpayer was obliged to provide information on exports made exempt from the obligation to apply the output tax on the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods left the country, provided that it also had the tax document which was the JCD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Failure to fulfil the obligations of tax entities to report imports and exports in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, tax entities did not provide correct data on imports and exports on VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="209">As tax entities did not have to attach the JCD lists to the VAT returns submitted, it was difficult to check the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">In the audited period, import or export duties and VAT were repaid or remitted at the discretion of the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="212">Tax entities were obliged by law to reduce the previously claimed VAT deduction entitlement by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office in the tax return for the period during which the tax was refunded.</seg>
<seg id="213">No legislation provided for the sending of information on changes in customs duty and VAT to tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="214">Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with considerable time delays and only from certain customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One audited tax authority did not receive this information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the tax office did not receive information on the changes in the amount of customs duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the information needed to check compliance with the legal obligation on tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002, the customs authorities refunded more than 319 million VAT. CZK and in 2003 in the amount of over 398 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="218">The results of the audit highlighted persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax administrations, some systemic errors in the cooperation of tax authorities with customs authorities and the failure to fulfil certain obligations of taxpayers filing VAT and SPD tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="219">When administering VAT and SPD, weaknesses were identified in particular in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="220">a) when VAT registrations were cancelled, the fulfilment of the payers' obligation to pay VAT on commercial assets registered or to be registered at the date of the cancellation of the registration for which the payer applied the tax deduction was only rarely verified,</seg>
<seg id="221">b) the tax authorities did not consistently use the possibility of tax checks or local investigations.</seg>
<seg id="222">This has in some cases underestimated the legitimacy of the right to deduct VAT,</seg>
<seg id="223">(c) the official records and oral protocols did not contain all the necessary data to demonstrate the legitimacy of the excessive VAT deductions applied,</seg>
<seg id="224">d) the tax authorities did not adequately verify imports and exports declared in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Control findings in SR</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Check of selected sample at tax offices</seg>
<seg id="227">For the selected sample, the SAO has verified or the tax office has carried out a tax check for the 2002 and 2003 tax years.</seg>
<seg id="228">After analysing tax returns and refund requests for selected tax entities of the SAO SR, the Tax Office requested that the relevant JCDs attest to imports and exports, invoices and proof of payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="229">Subsequently, SAO SR checked whether the submitted JCDs were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and fulfilled the decisive facts and legal conditions by applying the deduction of the entry tax on imports, the refund of the excess VAT deduction, the application of the export tax exemption and the refund of the SPD.</seg>
<seg id="230">SAO SR verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between SR and CR in 10 audited tax offices in the structure according to the JCD headings and the sum of statistical values listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="231">Total imports at a statistical value of 856,2 million were checked. SK, representing 5,11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into the SROV.</seg>
<seg id="232">Exports of selected commodities were checked at a total statistical value of 176 million. Sk, which represents 6.87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from SR to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white equipment, packaging equipment and software) from the EU States to the Slovak Republic were checked for a total statistical value of 532.8 million. Sk.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The SAO SR found irregularities at the tax offices between data recorded in the SR customs database and data reported in specific VAT returns, such as:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 tax entities (natural persons) indicated in their tax returns imports of goods totalling Sk 1 589 261, on the basis of which they claimed the refund of excessive VAT deductions.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the local investigations carried out at the initiative of the SAO SR, the tax authorities were unable to prove to the tax office the legitimacy of the application of the entry tax by the relevant evidence of the importation and payment of VAT,</seg>
<seg id="238">- the tax entity (s. r. o.) in the tax return for the tax year January 2003 declared the taxable transactions received in the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods in the value of 18 006 041 Sk and applied an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="239">The 2003 VAT returns show that the difference between the purchase and export volumes of Sk 59 161 535 incurred in January 2003 was not offset throughout 2003.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the abovementioned cases, the SAO SR requested the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax check on the excessive VAT deductions applied.</seg>
<seg id="241">- in another case, the tax entity (s. r. o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 indicated in the VAT returns the export of goods totalling 87 199 Sk.</seg>
<seg id="242">The verification in the SR customs database revealed that the tax entity carried out exports at a statistical value of Sk 296 747 during that period.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Tax Office carried out multiple local investigations at the company's head office, finding that the company manager (a UK citizen) had travelled and that the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">At the time of auditing the SAO, the tax administrator filed a complaint with the law enforcement authorities on suspicion of a non-tax offence.</seg>
<seg id="245">On the basis of the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO notes that the main problems in the administration and control of VAT and SPD occurred mainly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- not making use of the possibility of carrying out VAT tax checks on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases where excessive VAT deductions are applied,</seg>
<seg id="247">- the tax control protocols did not contain an inventory of the audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- JCD when importing and exporting goods,</seg>
<seg id="249">- insufficient verification of reported imports and exports of goods in tax returns,</seg>
<seg id="250">- lengthy management of tax administrations in the issuing of decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, as well as the termination of the right to sanction,</seg>
<seg id="251">- non-compliance with the legal conditions for granting deferrals,</seg>
<seg id="252">- the non-offsetting of VAT arrears within the time limit for the refund of the excess VAT deduction,</seg>
<seg id="253">- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="254">Based on the audit of the SAO's deficiencies, the competent tax authorities requested VAT to be reviewed, focusing on the justification of the excessive VAT deductions applied to 14 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the deficiencies identified, which the SAO will monitor and control.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="257">International cooperation enabled the examination of trade transactions between trading partners from both countries and highlighted weaknesses in the registration of imports and exports.</seg>
<seg id="258">The checks also resulted in the identification of persistent deficiencies in the fulfilment of the obligations of VAT and SPD payers, in the activities of the financial and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and efficiency of tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="259">The lessons learned also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the customs database of the Czech Republic. In the SR, there is no similar system of transmission of information on imports and exports of goods between the customs and tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="260">The procedure for verifying the performance of VAT and SPD administration was not identical due to different legislation and conditions in the territory of both States.</seg>
<seg id="261">The SAO verified the necessary data from the information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the supporting documents available at the audited financial offices. SAO SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="262">If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel VAT and SPD checks carried out assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period prior to accession to the European Union and highlighted the need for further cooperation in this area.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will be further deepened in the control of the activities of the financial and tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">This declaration must be made by all VAT payers who have delivered goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrations are obliged to enter data from summary reports into the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES), to which tax administrations from the Member States of the European Union have access.</seg>
<seg id="268">The financial and/or tax authorities are then able to compare these data with those given in the tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="269">This system is also used to verify the validity of VAT registrants, to verify the lawfulness of the VAT exemption applied when goods are delivered to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.</seg>
<seg id="270">The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="271">The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outputs of the forthcoming control actions, which will focus, among other things, on screening the VIES system to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intracommunity supplies."</seg>
<seg id="272">Given the importance of VAT and SPD for budgetary revenues, control activities need to be focused primarily on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to limit the scope for tax evasion in indirect taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of inspections at asylum facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State property and funds intended to safeguard the activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Control Action No. 04/23 "State Property and Funds for Securing the Activities of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of the Interior"</seg>
<seg id="4">Control Action No 15/2004 "Control of the economy with assets and financial provisions intended for asylum and temporary refuge in the Slovak Republic"</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is one of the phenomena of a global nature and has become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its main cause is the escape of citizens from the country of origin or last permanent residence from persecution, in particular for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">They aim to gain asylum and integration into society, especially in one of Europe's advanced democratic countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The large group is also composed of foreigners whose reasons for migration are unfavourable economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">The adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, by which the governments of the signatory countries undertook to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation, has already produced concrete principles for helping refugees.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republics ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue after the division in 1993 by continuing to implement the adopted international documents and confirmed their binding in the framework of national legislation by means of a legal act.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both republics have enshrined asylum in their constitutional laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the International Audit Office of the Republic were focused on the asylum process and related issues, the results of which are contained in the joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Offices of both countries was carried out on the basis of the "Surveillance Cooperation Treaty" ("the Treaty") concluded in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Treaty, both Parties undertook to provide each other with information on the legislation governing asylum procedures in the State of the other Party, selected statistics on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as on asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aim of the parallel control action was to identify the same problem lines and highlight the implications for the area of population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cooperation consisted of the alignment of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information to the extent provided for by the Treaty and the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.</seg>
<seg id="20">The first joint meeting, which took place between 5.4 and 7.4.2004, established the same categories of controlled issues and control procedures for the preparation of control actions.</seg>
<seg id="21">The second meeting, which took place between 28.6 and 30.6. 2004, clarified the common points for the control action programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The third joint meeting, which took place during the control action from 8.11 to 10.11.2004, exchanged experiences from ongoing inspections.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of outputs from the checks have been specified and the structure and content of the joint final report drawn up at the last joint meeting on 14 February to 17 February 2005 have been provisionally established.</seg>
<seg id="24">The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Czech Republic, inspectors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial unions carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="26">The audited persons were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MV") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Slovak Republic carried out the control of the defence section, the army and the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="28">The audited body was the Migration Department of the Ministry of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Ministry of Education").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (the audited period).</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, statistics for a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of control results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Evaluation of control activities</seg>
<seg id="33">The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The mutual exchange of experience between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Czech Audit Office of the Czech Republic took place during the preparation and implementation of the control actions.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange enabled a more thorough evaluation of the evidence submitted, analysing the causes of the detected differences in securing the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="36">This made it possible to concentrate on the critical problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ultimately, this positively affected the quality of the performance of the control activity.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of control results</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents ("the EU") has been the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the preparedness of both countries to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The adoption of legislation on this issue is continuing after both countries have joined the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants is on a steadily growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security for asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.</seg>
<seg id="44">The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="45">The amount of expenditure drawn from the national budget of both countries is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the granting or granting of asylum and also by the state of health of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the parties to asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, food, healthcare and basic material and hygiene supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the same time, leisure activities are organised and conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="50">Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, in the Czech Republic and integration centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost per day depends on the Centre's occupancy and equipment and is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is in principle stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic, it is projected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to create conditions for applicants, which are expected to continue to apply the Dublin Convention for years to come.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, the highest proportion of approved budgetary expenditure was spent on security of services. The decisive expenditure of this item was expenditure on accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work carried out and premiums contributed significantly to the overall expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Expenditure on wages, salaries and premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services contributed decisively to the absorption of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of state property.</seg>
<seg id="60">These were weaknesses in particular in the use of State budget resources contrary to the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act when current expenditure covered actions having the character of technical evaluation of long-term tangible assets.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Accounting Act in the area of inventory and non-compliance with the accounting curriculum was also violated.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies in the handling of state property were also identified when it was left for use by another person without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in land registry data violated the Land Registry Act and leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person entitled to waste management violated the Waste Act.</seg>
<seg id="64">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings in the provision of disproportionately high reserves for the consumption of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in public procurement and the management of State property were also identified when its records were not adequately secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system was ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation governing the way financial control is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="66">The submitted written dossier did not identify deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite some deficiencies identified, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic have positively assessed the procedure of the SUZ and the MU in providing services for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the knowledge gained during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's Supervisory Authority note that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational units of both countries have managed the tasks associated with the care of asylum seekers at the appropriate level.</seg>
<seg id="69">The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The results of the audit were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the relevant organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that positive methodological experience from control be used in other joint control actions within the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (the Refugee Status Convention followed by the 1967 New York Protocol).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and Amending Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective in the Czech Republic since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act was amended five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process and the adoption of further amendments will be linked to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the time of the Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, asylum was part of the third pillar of the EU and asylum documents were binding political documents.</seg>
<seg id="79">The adoption of this law already sought to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the shift of asylum from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when asylum law became part of Community law from 1.5. 1999 on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift has created the need to create appropriate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in the appropriate legal obligation.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic entered the EU and their transposition period at the time of Supreme Audit Office inspection, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="84">After their implementation into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission how it transposed.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and determining the obligations of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been granted temporary refuge in the Slovak Republic was laid down by Law No 283/1995 of the National Council of the Slovak Republic with effect from 1.1.1996. z., the fugitive.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No 480/2002 Z. "on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws, incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with the Council of Europe Directive 2001/55/ES from the 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for the granting of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between Member States to recruit such persons and to endure the resulting consequences.</seg>
<seg id="87">Following two amendments to Act No 480/2002 of the Asylum Act 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved in early 2005, which means further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">Its important elements are, for example, the obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course on the basis of Slovak language during their stay in the integration centre, the appointment of a guardian by the courts of unaccompanied foreigners if they are staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship in certain circumstances, as specified in the amendment to the law.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of Slovak Republic law with EU law in the field of migration and asylum process was assessed in regular reports by the European Commission on preparedness for accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002, the report drew attention to the insufficient personnel capacity of the Ministry of Education, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters relating to refugees fall within the competence of the MV.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1.1.1996, the MV established the organisational arm of the SUZ State. This was due to the separation of State Administration's enforcement of the asylum procedure, which is carried out through the MV Department of Asylum and Migration Policy, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The task of the SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to participants in asylum and asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic, they carry out decisive tasks in the field of the MA asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of aliens' applications for asylum in the I. the level of administrative management and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it develops concepts for the migration policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="98">Cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has significantly affected the results achieved in the area of asylum system development in the Slovak Republic in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="99">His financial participation in the reconstruction of the asylum housing stock was of particular benefit.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the chart.</seg>
<seg id="103">A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 the number of refugees from Chechnya increased.</seg>
<seg id="104">For an overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic, see Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="105">A total of 394 cases were granted asylum in the audited period, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">A total of 22,731 cases were not granted asylum in the audited period and 22,636 cases were terminated.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of parties to the 1 January proceedings shall comprise both those to whom the decision has not yet been taken and those to whom the decision has not been transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="108">It also includes persons who have been forgiven for missing the time limit for lodging an appeal, or who have been annulled and have not yet been issued with a new decision.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers is on a steadily growing trend.</seg>
<seg id="110">If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, it was already 10,358 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="111">A significant increase in the number of applicants occurred in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 persons applied for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">The results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the audited period are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="113">A total of 49 asylums were granted in the audited period and did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">The asylum procedure was terminated in a total of 23,088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">A large proportion of applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without authorisation, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before closing.</seg>
<seg id="117">In 2002, it accounted for more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and by more than 94% in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="118">The length of stay of one applicant in one of the asylum facilities, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The MÚ's findings also show that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are seeking better living conditions, i.e. economic migration, which is not supported by documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic also applied.</seg>
<seg id="120">In such cases, the asylum system is used for a purpose by the applicant.</seg>
<seg id="121">An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is not grounds for granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such a request should be in accordance with the provisions of § 12 clause. 1 font. a) Act No 480/2002 Z. z., on asylum, assessed as manifestly unfounded and should be decided within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">Internationally recognised principles to identify economic migrants are not yet established to distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and to speed up the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is a transit country from the point of view of international migration and the destination countries of migration are and remain Western European States.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement designating the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents the submission of multiple special purpose asylum applications in several EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="127">Applicants shall return to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic is part of the EU's external borders, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to establish conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until a decision on granting or not granting asylum is taken.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Use of funds</seg>
<seg id="130">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and national legislative provisions based thereon.</seg>
<seg id="131">The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision granting asylum and their health status.</seg>
<seg id="133">The increasing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the increased use of statutory benefits for applicants, such as expenditure on food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.</seg>
<seg id="134">The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic during the audited period the meals were 58 CZK per person per day, 12 CZK per person per day and 6 CZK per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="136">The cost per asylum seeker per day was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">In addition to pocket money, asylum seekers staying in residential centres with separate cooking and applicants staying privately outside asylum facilities may be granted a contribution of up to a minimum of life.</seg>
<seg id="138">Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, inter alia, grants the municipalities a right in Section 84 of the Municipality to pay the costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility in its territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and during the audited period amounted to CZK 7 per person per stay day.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil per month in the audited period provided that in the given month the student attended the school for a minimum of 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period, the meals were 70 Sk per person per day, the allowance was 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="143">The cost per asylum seeker per stay day averaged 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">The municipalities in whose territory the asylum facility is located comply with Law No 480/2002 Z. from., on asylum, an allowance is granted for the partial reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">The municipalities have so far only partially used the possibility to apply for a contribution of Sk 1,500 per bed and calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">National legislation in both countries for issuing asylum decisions provides for a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure while allowing, where justified, an extension of that period.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for the extension of the asylum procedure, which affects the amount of expenditure of the state budget, is the lodging of appeals against the decision not to grant asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the asylum application (17.61%).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum procedures opened in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.</seg>
<seg id="151">Within two years of the opening of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic, according to MÚ data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the statutory possibility of extending the time limit by bringing an appeal to court.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and at the time of the auditing the proceedings were not terminated in court.</seg>
<seg id="154">A certain benefit in the shortening of asylum procedures is expected from the establishment of joint workplaces of the Ministry of Education and Labour of the Police Corps in reception centres in Adam-Gbeloch, Opatovský Nový Vsi and Liptovské Vlachoch, which was acceded to at the time of the inspection from the 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="155">This foresees simplifying procedures and shortening the time limits for proceedings between the two elements of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created appropriate conditions for the provision of services to participants in asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="158">Asylum facilities provide asylum seekers with accommodation, catering, healthcare, pocket and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during their stay.</seg>
<seg id="159">At the same time, leisure courses are organized and conditions for cultural and sporting activities are created for applicants.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">The SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible for managing the state property in the reception centre of Vyšní Loti, the reception and residence centre of Červý Újchod, the residential centres of Bělá-Jezová, the Stop near Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the buildings of integration</seg>
<seg id="162">At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">The SUZ also provides for the operation of asylum facilities in Strážž pod Ralskem, Seči, Bruntál, Zbyšov and Kasava, which are operated by a legal person pursuant to § 80 para. 3 Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of reception centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of the accommodation centres is 1,977 seats.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed establishments that asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception operations referred to in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="166">A breach of the obligation to reside in a reception centre shall be regarded as an offence.</seg>
<seg id="167">Residential centres where asylum seekers arrive from reception centres shall be used to accommodate asylum seekers until a decision on their application for asylum has become legally effective.</seg>
<seg id="168">Under certain conditions, asylum seekers have the option of leaving or staying in private residences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Asylum seekers shall have the right to free accommodation, provision of meals, other services and allowances in the reception and residence centres in which they are declared to be resident, provided that they have endured the operations necessary to establish their financial and property circumstances, and such conditions are such that they cannot be fairly required to partially reimburse those services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration centres shall be used for the temporary accommodation of persons granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are accommodated in the Centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until they manage to provide adequate housing or secure it themselves under the state integration programme.</seg>
<seg id="172">In the integration centre, clients pay for all accommodation costs and cater individually.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons with granted refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">To compare asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best indicator of the cost per physical stay day.</seg>
<seg id="176">It is based on the actual number of people who have actually been provided with the services provided by the asylum facility every day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and chart, the SUZ-operated facilities are identified as owned and operated by legal entities pursuant to Section 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as contractual.</seg>
<seg id="178">The costs per stay day in the SUZ's own asylum facility are decreasing with the increasing full capacity of these facilities. The reason is that the fixed costs of running the premises are allocated to more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The volume of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers increases directly in proportion with the increasing number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis capacity were accommodated in their own asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="181">In part of 2003, exceptional accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds in total) was used to address the capacity crisis of asylum facilities caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">This capacity was ensured by leasing 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.</seg>
<seg id="183">The expenditure per applicant per stay day was then lower in these years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, the long-term maintenance of high capacity of these facilities is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="185">The risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the need for more accommodation should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, it is not possible to perform some repairs, maintenance and investments in fully occupied accommodation capacity.</seg>
<seg id="187">The form of asylum facilities operated on a contractual basis enables the adoption of operational solutions in the field of asylum facility capacities where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Asylum facilities are reception centres and residence centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The Ministry of Education has reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and a residence centre Brezová pod Bradlom.</seg>
<seg id="191">The total capacity of reception centres is 470 seats and the residence centre is 100 seats.</seg>
<seg id="192">An increasing number of asylum seekers were dealt with by the Ministry of Education by setting up a residence centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Bratislava Technical University with flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 seats.</seg>
<seg id="193">According to the concluded contract, the leaseholder also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the Centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this way, the MEA addressed the lack of its own staff.</seg>
<seg id="195">The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in leased premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.</seg>
<seg id="196">Reception centres had an average occupancy of between 57% and 62% during the audited period, with an average occupancy of between 33% and 50% in residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="197">Occupancy varied according to the season and was highest in the last months of the year when he applied for asylum for many more applicants compared to other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 seats will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovský Nový Vsi and Vlachoch.</seg>
<seg id="199">Following the completion of the Humennom Centre in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Costs of asylum facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the cost of operating asylum facilities are given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body providing the premises and security of the facilities, including the related activities, is one way of securing at reasonable cost the tasks arising from the residence of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of State funds and assets</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of management</seg>
<seg id="205">In the Czech Republic, the approved budget expenditure of the SUZ was increased by CZK 103,077 by thirteen budgetary measures in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of which CZK 89,979 thousand (87.29%) were assigned funds. Most of it was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538 thousand) and to provide health care to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002, the SUZ's expenditure was increased by CZK 88,362 thousand by 20 budgetary measures.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of which CZK 62,282 thousand (70.48%) were dedicated funds, most of which (CZK 53,200 thousand) were intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003, the SUZ's expenditure was increased by CZK 88,078 thousand by 14 budgetary measures.</seg>
<seg id="210">Of these, 82,000 thousand CZK (93.09%) were assigned funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">The amount of CZK 51,000 was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000 to deal with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000 for the program of humanitarian evacuations of disabled people in the Republic of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">For an overview of the use of selected SUZ expenditure during the audited period, see Table 5.</seg>
<seg id="213">It is clear from the above overview that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="214">The amount of expenditure incurred for the purchase of services ranged from 37,07% to 38,23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">The aggravating expenditure under this heading was expenditure on accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, expenditure on medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing security at individual asylum facilities.</seg>
<seg id="216">Expenditure on salaries, payments for work and premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) contributed significantly to the SUZ's total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, material purchases (around 14%) contributed significantly to the SUZ's total expenditure, with food purchases (7.61%? 9,83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the Ministry of Migration Policy and the asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures addressing legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">The draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part was characterised, in particular, in 2001 and 2002, by an imbalance between the requirements of the Ministry of Education, which were based on the increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs of their legal entitlements, and the resources provided, in particular, in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter addressed disproportions during the year with several budgetary measures increasing the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by up to 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">For an overview of the expenditure collected by the Ministry of Education during the audited period, see Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Expenditure on wages, salaries and premiums, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51%, and expenditure on materials and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure, contributed decisively to the absorption of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="223">Over 10% were expenditure on security services and between 3.92% and 7.20% were expenditure on food purchases.</seg>
<seg id="224">Another significant part was expenditure on accommodation and catering services, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">A relatively low proportion, ranging from 1,03% to 6,25%, was capital expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2. Deficiencies identified</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and assets.</seg>
<seg id="228">These were weaknesses in particular in the following areas: (a) the use of State budget appropriations contrary to the purpose for which they were intended by the State Budget Act when current expenditure was covered by actions having the character of technical appreciation of long-term tangible assets; b) violation of the Accounting Act in the area of inventories and non-compliance with the indicative accounting curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic, minor shortcomings were also identified in the handling of State property, when it was left for use to another person without an appropriate contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to land registry data violated the Land Registry Act; the Waste Act has been violated by leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not authorised to dispose of the waste.</seg>
<seg id="230">In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings in the provision of disproportionately high reserves for the consumption of electricity and natural gas, deficiencies in public procurement and the management of State property were also identified when its records were not adequately secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">At 1 July 2002 the SUZ introduced an internal control system within the meaning of Act No. 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, interim and subsequent checks.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, an internal audit system was introduced and an internal auditor of the SUZ appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Each year, the SUZ is issued with a plan of financial, social and operational technical controls aimed at a comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and assets in individual asylum facilities managed by the SUZ.</seg>
<seg id="235">42 management inspections were carried out in 2002 and 54 were carried out in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in respect of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations ensures the Ministry's controls.</seg>
<seg id="237">Within the audited period, the tasks of the asylum policy section were not checked.</seg>
<seg id="238">The internal control system of the Ministry of Education is primarily focused on the implementation of preliminary and ongoing financial control according to Act No. 502/2001 Z. z., about checking and auditing.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of financial control is also governed by the internal rules of the Director of the Ministry of Education.</seg>
<seg id="240">The substantive orientations of the control activities as part of the management of the various departments were set out in the annual plan of the Ministry of Education.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint report on parallel checks on expenditure on construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be difficult to imagine.</seg>
<seg id="4">High-quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the living standards of Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and costs is an important task for government.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a very demanding task both in organisational and technical terms and in financial terms.</seg>
<seg id="7">European efforts at sustainable mobility often and hard to find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Construction of transport infrastructure, even with the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, is financially demanding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Considered procedures and government decisions in the preparation and acquisition of transport buildings can generate significant savings in public financial resources that can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the roles of the audit institutions is to actively look for shortcomings that have led to lower-than-achievable cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">Audit institutions should not only highlight the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures to improve the situation, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Short Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">The two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SRN and the Czech Republic) of the Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as the "BRH") and the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO") carried out parallel checks in 2005 and 2006 on expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 v</seg>
<seg id="14">Motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks to the cooperation with the SAO, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough check on the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the basis of close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained for comparative purposes the necessary data on the amount of German costs of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the construction process, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, during the procurement process, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "MSD") committed errors that led to the extension of the competition period and the shortening of the construction period.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, however, MSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint control work, the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 were compared based on the conversion per m2 of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per m2 of area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges over 100 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delay in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, the inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">The BRH and the SAO now have a database of bridge and tunnel prices that they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the construction of bridges, the two audit institutions recommend: the standardisation of bridge structures and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where biased reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">Among the main features of the cooperation was its team spirit and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the parallel inspection, the auditors participated in their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report reports on the progress and results of parallel checks on funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The controls focused on the cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parallel checks were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the number 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of this amount, €64 million of European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to the parallel checks carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH inspected the preparation and construction of motorway A 17 in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of motorway A 17 amounted to approximately € 670 million, of which € 277 million will be co-financed by the European Funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the trans-European transport corridor IV. Dresden - Central and Southern Eastern Europe - Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="42">Highway D 8 runs from Prague via Ústí nad Labem to the state border.</seg>
<seg id="43">Motorway A 17 runs from the Czech Republic/Germany national border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">Border sections of both motorways were under construction at the time of inspection.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the German side, the motorway is finished up to Dresden, while on the Czech side the D 8 motorway is not finished, because section 0805, 16.4 km across the Czech Central Mountain between Řehlovice and Lovosice, is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the plan, section 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the forecasts carried out in the Czech Republic in 2001, the traffic intensity of 22,940 vehicles per day should be on the border section No. 0807 of highway D 8 in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts, in 2010 the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech highway D 8 at the common state border by building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Both States are involved in the construction of the bridge, so monitoring the construction of the bridge was an important aspect of the parallel checks carried out by the two audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and SAO</seg>
<seg id="53">Since mid- 2005, the two highest audit institutions have discussed close cooperation in the control of the construction of the highway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both parties had serious reasons for such cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">GERMANY contributes financially to the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Its planning and construction is based on MSD.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SAO did not have at its disposal the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO needed to ensure the effectiveness of expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of travel on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Following preparatory negotiations, the Agreement on Coordinated Highway Control D 8/A 17 was signed by the Presidents of the two Supreme Audit Institutions on 4 January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint working meetings of the BRH and SAO auditors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="65">The negotiations dealt with current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from border bridge inspections and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">The ongoing exchange of information was an important feature of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="67">While BRH carried out most of the work on the comparison of technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and procurement procedures, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for monitoring the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">The applicable regulatory standards for control in government differ in the way control actions are concluded in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="69">For these reasons, the two Supreme Audit Institutions have drawn their own audit conclusions on their findings obtained during their checks.</seg>
<seg id="70">This report reflects the results achieved during the parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will end with the signing of the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of a border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the 2000 Treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a deadline for completion of the border bridge construction as far as possible in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">The two parties then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">As an investor, MSD was active.</seg>
<seg id="76">GERMANY contributes financially to the construction of the bridge from 42.13%.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, the MSD proposed that the border bridge should have a biased reinforced concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, MSD agreed to a related steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">This Decision was justified by the reduction of the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent ecological benefit of such a solution to the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">Moreover, the comparative calculations carried out by MSD indicated that the coupled steel-concrete construction should be a less expensive option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was a mistake in the calculations.</seg>
<seg id="82">They indicated that the new coupled steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">It's actually 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">During the award of the border bridge contract, the MSD made serious errors.</seg>
<seg id="85">It did not prepare the contract documentation to adequately describe the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for the benchmarking of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error led to a subjective and problematic evaluation by the Bid Assessment and Evaluation Board and the Director-General.</seg>
<seg id="87">The unsuccessful bidder contested the results of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">A subsequent investigation by the Competition Authority resulted in the contract for the award of the construction contract being signed later than originally envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="89">This meant that the 2004 summer construction season was wasted after the evaluation of the bids and that the construction period was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="90">The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The offered procedure included double mounting of the bridge superstructure, change in the construction of the pillars and establishment and equipment of the assembly premises.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the construction company was unable to obtain the originally designed type of steel at the necessary time.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel - at a cost of roughly €4 million, which had to be fully reimbursed by MSD - made it possible to shorten the period for the implementation of anti-corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to reduce the total period of construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other financing adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="95">The reduced period of time reserved for construction work led to an increase in the price of approximately €5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">The net cost is currently around €25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as at October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices</seg>
<seg id="98">The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Furthermore, tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).</seg>
<seg id="101">There are no similar tunnels on Highway A 17.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the check, it was important to identify the relevant prices accurately.</seg>
<seg id="103">The two supreme audit institutions set the following principles for comparing the prices of bridges: to be based on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to changes); not to take into account prices for special bridge bases; convert prices in CZK to € according to the European Central Bank rate applicable to 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = €1).</seg>
<seg id="104">On D 8 i A 17 there are bridges of various structures (steel-concrete, biased reinforced concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.</seg>
<seg id="105">In order to ensure homogeneity of the structures examined, bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">By far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border were concrete bridges (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused primarily on this group of bridges, since the number of sets allowed the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">Checks found that the prices per m of 2 concrete bridges on D 8 i A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="110">For German bridges, the price dependence was stronger than for Czech bridges (see graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges were identified on A 17 and four on D 8, whose price is significantly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">To find these bridges, a method was used to detect atypical values in a set of numbers, and a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the bridge's price on its size (for determining atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upwards).</seg>
<seg id="113">However, information on the atypically high price of those bridges should only be considered as an indicator of which bridges need to be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price should be analysed in each identified case.</seg>
<seg id="115">One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures or environmental protection requirements or other acceptable grounds.</seg>
<seg id="116">Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the bridge's price on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis about lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labour costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to the German Republic.</seg>
<seg id="118">However, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">During the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this situation were identified:</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the contract contest.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic many bridges are awarded as part of the contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic there is more variability in bridge construction than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision shall be taken at the time when the MSD translates the request for a territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="129">Although MSD selects types of bridges from several variants at this time, economics plays a smaller role in decision making.</seg>
<seg id="130">The general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be made on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction market in both countries, which would however go beyond this control action.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels, the prices of tunnels on D 8 were found to be twice as high as those in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, the comparison of the main construction and technical parameters of the tunnels on D 8 with the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the Czech Republic in the field of tunnel construction.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, a small number of tunnels did not make it possible to draw generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Efficiency and efficiency of construction of the Dresden motorway - Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">A separate Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">The government approved the concept of the development of the motorway network in the same year.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 motorway should be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No. 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains should have been acquired earlier than the border section No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic acquires motorway D 8 within the framework of programme funding.</seg>
<seg id="142">The programme No. 327 220 "Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - state border of the Czech Republic/Germany" set two objectives for the construction of the motorway D 8:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem - a national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the links between Prague and Berlin in the framework of IV. the trans-European transport corridor Berlin - Istanbul - an international objective.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, construction of the section running through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and construction of the border section No. 0807 in June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It must be added here that the completion date is not identical to the commissioning date.</seg>
<seg id="149">The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.</seg>
<seg id="150">Environmental activists have challenged this decision with lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="151">There is no final decision on the actions.</seg>
<seg id="152">Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed several years later than mentioned in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion of section 0805 for 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective - to improve the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The MSD made an estimate of capital expenditure on the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains in 1999 - 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The estimate in this capital expenditure of the included investment costs is about €639 million combined for both sections 0805 and 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Economic assessment results (EIRR = internal rate of return)</seg>
<seg id="158">All considered motorways and speed roads opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="160">All considered motorways and speed roads opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="162">All considered motorways and speed roads opened, both sections of D 8 opened in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be open at the original date.</seg>
<seg id="166">This will reduce the above mentioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The cost of both sections, excluding VAT, as at 31 December 2005, was €897 million, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the level of costs with which the 2001 economic analysis was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="168">However, there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on a different, more costly route, which would affect the aforementioned economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="169">The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable with a traffic intensity of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the problem of roadside routes for the missing section across the Czech Central Mountains foresees a traffic intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="171">In the case of higher loads of roadways for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The above-mentioned decrease in revenues and cost increases means that the EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 was to have had will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="173">Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.</seg>
<seg id="174">Also during the construction of the A 17 motorway there was a similar excess of costs as in the case of these two sections on D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment of the federal road development plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany envisaged a cost of about €320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost-benefit ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, however, costs have soared to about €670 million and the cost-benefit ratio has fallen by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition to the parallel checks carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of motorway A 17 in 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">In doing so, the BRH found that the competent approval authority had requested an off-road tunnel for Section A 17, which was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the control operation, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Administration for Road Construction that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">This resulted in savings of around €10 million and €0.15 million in annual operating costs alone.</seg>
<seg id="182">When assessing the first section A 17, BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not survey the rock floor conditions in the Dölzschen rocks because the site was difficult to access.</seg>
<seg id="185">This was done only after the tunnel strike machine hit the rock.</seg>
<seg id="186">Tests showed that the rocks inside were more stale than anticipated during the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="187">Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injection and stone protection nets had to be taken, requiring around €3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Directorate of Roads and Motorways had to bear the costs not only of other extraordinary operations, such as the safety measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also of measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.</seg>
<seg id="189">Expenditure of this kind includes costs related to interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), additional training of drilling staff (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods due to exceeding the duration of the project (€7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">The cost overruns thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.</seg>
<seg id="191">On the basis of lessons learned from these and other controlled projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter guidance in its supervision of road construction work.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Federal Ministry should give the Directorate of Roads and Motorways the necessary incentive to implement quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, commissioning and progress of the border bridge construction.</seg>
<seg id="195">The two Supreme Audit Institutions have built a database of bridges and tunnels prices on which to rely on future controls.</seg>
<seg id="196">The SAO found that the main building-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are not different from the parameters of A 17.</seg>
<seg id="197">The auditors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience which can be used for further inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated control of funding for projects implemented under the Operational Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The emerging community of the people of Europe is driving cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let this Community give an opening statement on this joint report of the two supreme audit institutions of the neighbouring countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral, often a remnant of the darker parts of Europe's history.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover different border regions: some cover coastal areas, others inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programmes are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries. "</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last seven years and are allocated a total of EUR 5.7 billion from the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The programmes include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling paths and bridges, investment in cross-border waste management systems, healthcare facilities, research centres, flood prevention measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, employment advice, creation of thematic networks and cluster</seg>
<seg id="12">Support from the programme is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly to decide which projects will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself is over.</seg>
<seg id="15">The funding shall be provided on condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four features: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of the project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The main attributes of the partnership include: joint selection of the lead partner, joint preparation of the project and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assumption of overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, total payments of support are received by the lead partner and their transfer to the relevant project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Eligible projects carried out on the territory of regions and regions adjacent to the common border may be supported.</seg>
<seg id="19">OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Polish Republic 2007-2013 (OPPS CR-POL).</seg>
<seg id="21">€ 258 187 467 has been allocated for the implementation of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The total amount included a contribution from the European Funds (ERDF) totalling € 219 459 344 (85%), which must be exhausted by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial data on the use of EU funds from the Operational Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Polish Republic 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The Agreement on Cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the Presidents of both offices on 27 February 2013 following previous mutual meetings at the Heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia held in Lovasbereny, Hungary in September ary 2012.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim of the cooperation was to check whether the implementation of the operational programme is in accordance with the legislation and binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system is reliable, whether the objectives of the operational programme are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the support provided.</seg>
<seg id="26">This cooperation took the form of a parallel check whereby, on the basis of their statutory mandate, the audit authorities independently examined topics the content of which had been discussed together in advance.</seg>
<seg id="27">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="28">The audit carried out also included elements of the performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">Selected topics were examined on a sample of projects by project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The checks carried out resulted in audit findings published in the usual manner by both offices.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the basis of the two audit conclusions set out in the Annex, this joint report was established.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint control sample included six projects (Annex 1) falling within aid area 1.1 - Enhancing transport accessibility and aid area 2.2 - Support for tourism development.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the start of the audit, the use of funds from these two support areas represented more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to the beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the whole OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="34">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to checking the joint sample of six projects, the SAO inspected another 13 projects and NIK checked two more (all in the area of aid 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The funds paid to the beneficiaries of the ERDF aid, which were controlled by the SAO and NIK, totalled €25,362,174 (SAO) and €8,450,784 (NIK).</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited amount represented 41% of all funds paid to aid beneficiaries in aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS</seg>
<seg id="39">Both checks independently carried out by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of OPPS CR-POL, which includes the operation of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">The audited persons who were part of the management and control system have taken steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and the non-use of ERDF funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the set objectives, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the social evaluation of the implementation of the projects.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THE INSPECTION</seg>
<seg id="44">AND. Evaluation of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach enabled the control of the management and control system of OPPS CR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry of Local Development of the Czech Republic), the national coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development POL) and the controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Province).</seg>
<seg id="46">At the same time, the coordinated audit enabled the evaluation of the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the evaluation of the management system, the control focused on the activities carried out in connection with the setting up and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in relation to setting the objectives of the programme and monitoring progress made, evaluation activities and annual reports, assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, by drawing on the Programme's resources and fulfilling the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies; in addition to the control activities of the managing authority, the setting of the performance of the activities and the output from the audits of the delegated audit body and the reporting and monitoring system of irregularities and their compliance, coordination of tasks and cooperation between the institutions involved in OPPS CR-POL has also been examined.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the drawing up of control plans at the site of project implementation have been examined and the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators has been assessed.</seg>
<seg id="49">The verification of the control system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot checks, which allowed the authorisation of, for example, the supply of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, and the consistency of the disbursement of such funds and associated activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="50">Significant shortcomings were identified by the SAO's audit of the publication of correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.</seg>
<seg id="51">The evaluation and approval of projects identified a risk of lack of transparency in this process.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other deficiencies were identified in the monitoring indicator settings and in the irregularity reporting system settings.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities identified by NIK concerning the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to infringements of applicable laws and rules were not assessed as significant.</seg>
<seg id="55">These irregularities only affected individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the irregularities identified, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project results</seg>
<seg id="58">The check did not show a contradiction between the indicators and objectives set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">All audited projects achieved expected results, financed activities were implemented and indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.</seg>
<seg id="60">The audit conclusions are consistent with the outcome of the survey of social evaluation of the implementation of the projects described in the text below.</seg>
<seg id="61">An important aspect to which the SAO and NIK have paid attention in their conclusions is the limited possibility of an objective evaluation of the achievement of the projected results of each project, taking into account the objectives of each project and the objectives of the entire operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">On the initiative of the Supreme Chamber of Auditors, an opinion poll was conducted in summer 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.</seg>
<seg id="63">The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nyse (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey concerned in particular the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of the projects, including investments made.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents per project is set out in Annex 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The assessment of the survey responses indicated that the overall societal evaluation of the projects was good and amounted to 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both with respect to the objectives and with respect to the other parameters set out in the project applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and renewed contacts between residents of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall assessment of responses indicated a distinction between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were in line with the views of the participants of the panel discussions (target groups) carried out in the context of the NIK check on the Polish side, who pointed out the need to implement the projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and fulfilment of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Evaluation of the legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">The compatibility of the project's substantive and timely implementation with the timetable and content of the project application has been examined for the beneficiaries, further verify the achievement of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, handling of possible project revenues, fulfilment of the obligation to separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the ban on funding for projects from other EU sources, implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions; the implementation of mandatory publicity on, in particular, the dissemination of awareness of sources of funding for EU projects; compliance with the eligibility conditions for project expenditure, selection of suppliers and verification of the performance delivered on the basis of the procurement awarded.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial value of the shortcomings of the qualifying SAO and NIK as expenditure ineligible for EU funding was found at €85,094.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, this amount did not exceed the determined level of materiality related to the total audited amount for the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the observed irregularities, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="78">In most cases, the obligations arising from the conditions of the aid to the beneficiary were properly fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Funds for the implementation of controlled projects have been spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nevertheless, seven of the eight aid beneficiaries audited by NIK were found to have irregularities in the fulfilment of material and financial obligations.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of a non-systemic nature and concerned in particular inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breaches of public procurement rules, which did not have an impact on the choice of contractor or the supply of contractually agreed works.</seg>
<seg id="82">In only one of the NIK-controlled projects, the identified irregularity related to non-compliance with reporting obligations can be assessed as an ineligible expenditure of PLN 43,003 (of which EUR 8,231 financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other hand, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2,098 053 in three of the 19 projects audited (of which €76,863 was financed by the ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">The irregularities included the failure to deliver the material and work paid for or the expense of modernising the property owned by a person who was not linked to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system in particular with a view to the consistent establishment of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">In general, it is also necessary to endeavour to identify indicators at programme level as well as projects that allow more reliable verification of the implementation of the impacts identified.</seg>
<seg id="88">The notes and recommendations resulting from the checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in the SAO and NIK separate audit conclusions on CDs.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNIQUÉ</seg>

<seg id="1">Public works procurement and prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel control carried out by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the State is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">The EU has set limits in its rules, beyond which the contracting authority must meet certain requirements to guarantee a wide and unrestricted competitive environment across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="8">EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.</seg>
<seg id="10">For public contracts that are below EU value limits, regulation of their procurement remains the responsibility of individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with a consequent high potential for harm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and unfair favouritism (prevention of corruption).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel checks on procurement procedures and the prevention of corruption in land and transport structures.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cooperation was also focused on European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The controls included the award of contracts below European thresholds in order to affect the area of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report, inter alia addressed to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Control areas and controlled institutions</seg>
<seg id="18">The evaluation of BRH is based on the blanket checks of the above mentioned areas carried out by the German construction administrations responsible for federal transport and land construction between 2011 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, highway construction and large-scale building projects have been evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The BRH also included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The SAO's evaluation is based on inspections carried out between 2008 and 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, the award of federal public contracts is mostly carried out by regional construction administrations.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the field of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of the state institution for road and railway construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the field of civil engineering, public procurement is carried out by the beneficiaries of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of external experts are also used in the various stages of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">The evaluation should take into account differences in public procurement legislation and the specificity of the construction market in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and sub-legal standards.</seg>
<seg id="29">Procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and by the relevant administrative acts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details concerning the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called procurement manuals of the federal government, in which the requirements are developed or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation concerning contracts with a value above and below European limits.</seg>
<seg id="33">The procurement law has undergone substantial changes in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new rules have strengthened transparency in procurement procedures, opened up room for greater competition and reduced opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fundamental aspects of procurement law in both countries</seg>
<seg id="36">As regards European procurement procedures, open and restricted procedures must be applied in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts under the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedure), but these are practically identical to the above mentioned conditions for European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates are invited on a European scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).</seg>
<seg id="39">In open procedures and in a call for competition, any candidate may submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercial specific parts and dividing it into sub-contracts.</seg>
<seg id="42">The award of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the procedure as many candidates as possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two characteristics of German procurement law represent over time tested instruments for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330 000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic it is necessary to apply the conditions of European procedures even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">The exception is a simplified sub-standard procedure where the contracting authority may use less demanding procedures.</seg>
<seg id="47">In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which a contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between open procedures and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="49">85 000 construction companies are registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1 900 have 20 or more employees.</seg>
<seg id="50">Total volume of contracting authorities' public works contracts and share of each type of procedure in both countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction work in Germany amounted to 7,675 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">CZK, of which CZK 1,138 billion (15%) was the share of public contracts, which included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities in addition to those awarded by the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of projects of federal road and land structures (without construction of railways and water structures) reached CZK 212.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the composition of federal land works and transport construction contracts was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public calls; 12.7% narrower management and closer challenges;</seg>
<seg id="55">6,6% negotiated procedures and direct procurement; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="56">The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached CZK 118.6 billion in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of construction work.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 it amounted to CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total volume.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedures; 14.3% restricted driving; 9,5% of the negotiated procedure; 8,4% simplified procedures for sub-prime contracts; 2,7% other proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="59">These data include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">These figures show that: parallel checks in both countries focused on a substantial part of the public procurement procedures; the prevention of corruption, which must still be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open meaning. procurement procedures are of key importance.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the main results</seg>
<seg id="62">The SAO and the BRH carried out parallel checks on the award of European works contracts with an emphasis on preventing corruption in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">The checks focused on the comparison of legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">Key findings are also presented:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national rights of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">The prevention of corruption is not only the aim of the EU Directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in terms of focus and detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, the essential requirement to be met by the procurement documents is to include all the information necessary for the preparation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specifications shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements limiting competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The procurement documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic the problem is the insufficient definition of the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, dividing contracts into parts where possible is required in order to promote a competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the findings of BRH, this requirement is respected in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">Audits of the SAO have shown that in the Czech Republic very large public works in the field of road construction are awarded without being divided into parts, or divided into parts, but only on very significant volumes. This can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These market potential constraints may result in significant cost increases and risk unserious price behaviour and inadmissible conventions.</seg>
<seg id="75">The legislation in both countries allows contracting entities, under certain conditions, to award additional works if the need arises only after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The requirements for the correct identification of the type of procurement procedure are met in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the Czech Republic, according to the applicable regulations, contracting entities may arbitrarily designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="78">The German rules on procurement and budgetary law give priority to open procedures for both European tenders and national tenders, known as public calls for competition.</seg>
<seg id="79">Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit a tender and also reduce the risk of corruption by making it difficult to negotiate prices illegally between candidates.</seg>
<seg id="80">At the same time, the best results are achieved in terms of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of large contracts whose estimated total price is above or above the EU thresholds, the audited contracting entities have always issued a European procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="82">Proper determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role in determining the type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases are used for objective pricing of public works in which values are based on completed construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="84">This is a sufficiently objective tool.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the field of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">When awarding a works contract under European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish the preliminary information and the notice of initiation in order to strengthen competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.</seg>
<seg id="88">In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">When selecting candidates to participate in a restricted procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and shall be published sufficiently in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should alternate as frequently as possible the candidates who are invited to participate in the procedure when selecting suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany there are some very detailed requirements for preventing the risks of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, contracting authorities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.</seg>
<seg id="97">Any agreements between those interested parties and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must be prevented to the extent possible from limiting competition in the form of illegal agreements.</seg>
<seg id="98">In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited German contracting authorities did not meet the above requirement in several cases (point 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="101">Labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements are designed to limit the scope for handling and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">Inspections in both countries identified only a few cases of irregularities (section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">The assessment and evaluation of tenders is procedurally regulated in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">The relevant German measures are more comprehensive but have not always been respected by the audited contracting entities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For example, contracting entities transmitted their tenders to third parties for consultation without prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="106">The tenders were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">The intended award of the contract must be subject to legal protection of enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.</seg>
<seg id="108">This legal protection rule is also designed to prevent corruptive action.</seg>
<seg id="109">The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.</seg>
<seg id="110">Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The tender documentation for the audited contracting entities in both countries was not always complete or fully credible.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of several procurement procedures, transparency requirements applied at European level have not always been adequately complied with in the minutes of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="113">In addition, some of the deficiencies identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.</seg>
<seg id="114">Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (point 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Summary of the guiding principles of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a directive on the coordination of public works procurement procedures to ensure free competition in the EU, supplies and services to ensure the free movement of goods and services and the Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures for the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (Review Procedures Directive), the two Directives being transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">The general procurement principles of the EU include in particular: the requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.</seg>
<seg id="119">in addition, the EU procurement principles include the Directive on the coordination of procurement procedures includes provisions relating to construction projects whose total expected value is or exceeds €5 million.</seg>
<seg id="120">These provisions affect: the contents of the procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the completion of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; qualification requirements which may be required of candidates; criteria for selecting the most appropriate tender.</seg>
<seg id="121">Legal protection of tenderers is governed by the Review Procedures Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the event of a potential breach of the procurement law, tenderers may have the decision of the contracting authority reviewed in accordance with the examination procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both countries have transposed EU requirements into national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="124">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="125">The importance of preventing corruption</seg>
<seg id="126">In either country, there is no legal definition of what corruption actually means.</seg>
<seg id="127">Corruption is generally seen as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for its own benefit.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, this means that such abuse is prompted by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption can hinder competition and cause serious economic losses.</seg>
<seg id="130">Overall corruption-related damage is estimated to account for 5% of world economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the EU, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">Where a contracting authority is involved in the contract, conventions limiting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may undermine confidence in the integrity, capacity and overall work of the public administration.</seg>
<seg id="133">Therefore, prevention of corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practice and practices must be monitored in particular in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to take adequate measures to prevent it.</seg>
<seg id="135">The adoption of preventive measures and the implementation of effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">The award of works contracts is generally regarded as particularly vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which is particularly relevant to active and passive bribery, the reception and offering of significant benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">The German Federal Government issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the Federal Administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the entire procurement process beyond risk analysis: the preference for open procurement; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, other measures preventing corruption have become part of the procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system for monitoring procurement for the construction of federal roads.</seg>
<seg id="142">With this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private projection offices can be fully recorded and analysed in order to identify any irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, and a level of labour or civil law is also considered.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and prohibition of any discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in this area were set out by the Government in the "Government Strategy against Corruption 2011 to 2012," updated for 2013 and 2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Part of these measures has been incorporated into the Act on Public Procurement and Successive Implementing Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the thresholds for small-scale contracts; the obligation to notify the contracting authority ex ante, including the reasons for the contract; a prohibition on limiting the number of shortlisted tenderers and abolishing the general possibility of limiting the number of applicants by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; the obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="148">Results of the checks relating to the subsequent stages of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Procurement documents</seg>
<seg id="150">The tender documents shall contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.</seg>
<seg id="151">The documentation shall in particular enable the tender price to be processed.</seg>
<seg id="152">In order to do so, candidates must not be exposed to risks which they could not reckon with.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents contain specifications in particular, as well as requirements for proving the qualifications of tenderers and criteria for the selection of the most advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="155">In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">The specifications must minimise competition and all interested parties must have equal access to them.</seg>
<seg id="157">The specification must be neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Requirements for specific products are permitted on a very limited scale in the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="159">The basic principle of corruption prevention is that the procurement documents do not contain requirements that might restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, the documentation should avoid confusion or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">The basic principle is that specifications are generally given without reference to a particular product or brand.</seg>
<seg id="165">Specifications shall specify the required supplies and services and specify in detail the number of units of work and supply.</seg>
<seg id="166">In normal cases, prices should be indicated by units of works or supplies (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Defining the work required in terms of its functionality is only permissible in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="168">In principle, the rule is that specifications need to be drawn up completely and unambiguously.</seg>
<seg id="169">They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include works and supplies the necessity of which is not entirely obvious.</seg>
<seg id="170">Payment in the form of lump sums or according to the time worked should be avoided wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These parts of the procurement documents shall exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must allow each tenderer to prepare his offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender shall not be published until the procurement documents are complete.</seg>
<seg id="174">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation for contracting entities to award construction contracts in parts.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts, provided that the nature of the subject-matter of such a contract so permits.</seg>
<seg id="177">Germany requires the application of the rule to divide works into parts, either quantitatively (partial supplies) or according to specific aspects (specialised parts of the contract).</seg>
<seg id="178">This enables small and medium-sized entities to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixation difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is usually considered most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, procurement documents must contain evaluation criteria for national and European procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="181">This should inform the tenderer in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner of the criteria on which the tender will be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to include evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European calls for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national procurement procedures, evaluation criteria must only be included in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">If the procurement documents are prepared by authorized independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion of any information that would help identify specific interested companies, architects or designers.</seg>
<seg id="185">The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages without the knowledge of the contracting authority through contacts with these independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish tender documents and make them accessible for screening.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the only contact point for construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.</seg>
<seg id="189">In the case of large construction projects, after the conclusion of the original contract, there will almost always be a need for additional work or modification of existing works.</seg>
<seg id="190">The legislation of both countries makes it possible to award a multi-work contract within a certain limit to the same supplier without the need to publish and implement a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of multipliers under European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="192">Moreover, multi-machinery must be necessary and have the character of a specific component of the main contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied for the award of multipliers.</seg>
<seg id="194">This may lead to a risk of a greater time lag in the execution of the contract and the possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.</seg>
<seg id="195">Where a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision preventing suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multipliers.</seg>
<seg id="196">Calculations shall be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">In addition to multipliers, there may be minor works during construction, i.e. works that were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="198">In the Czech Republic it is not possible to compensate for each other.</seg>
<seg id="199">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In isolated cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards but were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, the specifications included particulars requiring a particular trademark, e.g. for a system of resistance of public inscriptions, for preventing water penetration or for noise cladding, although this was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Quantitative specifications divided into items</seg>
<seg id="206">The BRH has not, even in one case, recorded a check of the procurement procedures for non-compliance with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services in accordance with the quantitative specifications broken down into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the audited cases, tendering documents were fully prepared prior to the call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="209">However, in various cases the documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure, taking into account changes in items or in the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="210">In isolated cases, the procurement documents contained works and supplies that were insecure.</seg>
<seg id="211">One procurement document for demolition works contained almost exclusively such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Division of contract and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="213">In many cases, the required justification for not dividing deliveries into parts has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="214">For the award criteria, BRH did not find any shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of names of authorized independent experts</seg>
<seg id="216">Many documents listed interested authorized experts.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names were given on the opening pages of documents or on plans or annexed opinions.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact the explicitly appointed architect with their procurement questions.</seg>
<seg id="219">In the case of land construction projects, these cases were found primarily in the procurement documents, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the processing of the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="220">The contracting authorities indicated that they did not have sufficient personnel capacity to carry out detailed screening of the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="221">SAO</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house with 12 flats, there was a reference directly to specific manufacturers and product brands.</seg>
<seg id="224">The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar product types or justify requiring the delivery of specific products.</seg>
<seg id="225">For the construction of the facilities of the university, the procurement documents included references to specific companies and specific product labels.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overall list of specifications and sub-specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">In the case of the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority has not clearly defined the quantity and type of work, supplies or services required in the statement of dimensions in the procurement documents and has established only the cubic metre space for each building as a unit of measurement.</seg>
<seg id="228">Completeness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender documents for the restricted procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">This was due to changes in project documentation caused by the expansion of the scope of the contract and the change in technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">For the construction of social buildings, the procurement documentation had defects that forced the creation of multipliers (there was no precise focus, insufficient technical surveys were carried out, drawings were missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">The procurement documents for the construction of the large library listed interior elements only descriptively, without specifying qualitative product requirements.</seg>
<seg id="233">The supply of equipment for the interior of the building was provided by subcontractors who acquired some extra and very expensive equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Parts and criteria for the award of the contract</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award a contract in parts.</seg>
<seg id="236">The analysis of three large road structures during the construction of the road circuit showed that when they were awarded in open procedure in parts (separately after selected buildings), savings of up to 790 million could be achieved. CZK from the achieved price of public contracts 15,508 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, when six buildings were awarded as a separate part of the contract, a saving of 62.5 million could be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">CZK 25% of the contracted price and a saving of CZK 287.8 million could be achieved when awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract. CZK, i.e. also 25%.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the construction of the roads in the procurement documents, the contracting authority established qualifying criteria that restricted the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the procurement conditions of an open procedure for a supplier for one construction of a motorway, the contracting authority requested, inter alia, the practice of a supplier consisting in the implementation of at least three road constructions with a financial volume of every more than 700 miles. CZK, completed or operational during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="241">There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that fulfil the condition of completion of construction over 700 miles. CZK in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="242">The public contract for the supply of another highway construction in open procedure included six separate buildings for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of construction work in the last three years of EUR 12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="243">Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. €2.5 billion out of €3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.</seg>
<seg id="244">For 46 contracts for a total of CZK 13.2 billion there were only two or even one bidder.</seg>
<seg id="245">The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential could lead to a large increase in costs.</seg>
<seg id="246">Multiplication area</seg>
<seg id="247">In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the supply of multi-works during the construction of the road circuit and did not award any of the procedures specified in the Act.</seg>
<seg id="248">The value of the pre-approved multipliers in one case was 1 591.4 million. CZK excluding VAT (increase by 21%) and in the latter case CZK 4,135,8 million. CZK excluding VAT (increase by 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The main cause of the multiplication was the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.</seg>
<seg id="250">In the case of the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include in the procurement documents certain works and supplies, the necessity of which was already known for the completion and approval of the construction when the contract was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="251">For these works and deliveries he concluded additions to the contract for the work with the contractor with an increase in the price, in the negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of the work exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of the Palace of Justice, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="253">During the construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by 50,5 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="254">Unit prices of additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than comparable works carried out by the same supplier.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic are 355.0 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre of the four-lane motorway is 260.0 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests that buying a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summary</seg>
<seg id="260">The legal provisions relating to procurement documents are almost identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of European law.</seg>
<seg id="261">The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow candidates to calculate costs and prepare their bids.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and protects the contracting authority against the need to enter multi-machinery.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions on procurement documents are complemented by other rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and handling.</seg>
<seg id="265">Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing procurement criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">In both countries, specification requirements are generally met.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, in some cases deficiencies have been identified which could lead to a reduction in competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">At the same time, the rule in force in Germany requiring the subdivision of large construction projects into parts seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-volume projects without partial award or division into large-volume parts can limit the range of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="270">As a result of the strict requirement for references of tenderers, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of tenderers for road works, the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small range of tenderers does not give small and medium-sized firms a chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of tenderers also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal conventions.</seg>
<seg id="272">As regards the award and reimbursement of additional multi-work or modified work contracts, regulatory approaches in both countries differ.</seg>
<seg id="273">Where the value of additional work under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, multi-works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="277">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the multipliers must be entered on the basis of a new procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dividing work into parts avoids limiting competition as well as resulting adverse consequences.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the range of potential suppliers to be admitted to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting authority may leave the range of potential suppliers unlimited or limit the range to the criteria specified.</seg>
<seg id="283">A European procurement procedure must be conducted in the case of large project works whose value exceeds or exceeds the limits set by the EU.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="285">When choosing the type of management, the contracting authority shall meet in particular the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total cost of the contract for the required works exceeds or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million ($125 million). CZK), an open or limited procurement procedure at European level is always required.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue shall be permitted.</seg>
<seg id="288">Where a construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the European procurement procedure by issuing a national procedure where the total value of the part concerned is below €1.0 million ($25 million). CZK) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the estimated value of the entire contract.</seg>
<seg id="289">Dividing a construction project or deliberately estimating its costs too low in order to avoid the essential obligation to launch a European procurement procedure is not permissible.</seg>
<seg id="290">Choosing the type of management is very important for the prevention of corruption, as restricting competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="291">Therefore, a detailed justification for the type of procedure chosen is an important part of the procurement documentation, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="295">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures for procurement procedures at national level.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are allowed only if the conditions prescribed by law are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Unlike in the Czech Republic, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and corruption prevention principles prefers open proceedings or a public invitation to participate in proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of proceedings, including restricted procedures, are admissible only exceptionally, where permitted by legislation.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such exceptions shall be justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of open procedure preference is intended to ensure that restrictions on competition are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation is limited (specific candidates selected in advance).</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="303">A correct estimate of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for a decision on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the cost of building projects, contracting entities in Germany may rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for construction types, building units, building parts and sub-works.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or works.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, the database is expected to be extended at national level.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable buildings to determine the expected costs of public works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="310">In many cases, the determination of costs is based on an estimate of the entity financing the project or is based on the value of the resources available to that entity.</seg>
<seg id="311">Standardisation measures are still at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="312">Based on the anti-corruption programme 2011-2012, the relevant ministries are to develop a database of the usual prices of standardised commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">The application of the price system to determine the expected price of a contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the establishment of the subject-matter in detail.</seg>
<seg id="314">The pricing system should serve as a set of information on works, materials and products and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Ministry of Transport has issued prescriptive prices for transport works in order to check them, which are regularly updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of the construction work preparation.</seg>
<seg id="317">Main BRH control findings</seg>
<seg id="318">Selection of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public invitation to participate, thereby complying with the requirements of the budgetary and procurement legislation.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of land construction was 59.5%.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.</seg>
<seg id="323">On the basis of information collected from more than 16 000 proceedings, the BRH has found that restricted proceedings have a clear disadvantage compared to public proceedings and public appeals, and restricted proceedings also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="325">According to the BRH study, bidding prices in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% to 10% higher than in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Regional Court of Auditors confirmed differences in the value for money obtained in public and restricted proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="327">Indeed, a study by the Ministry of Construction found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="328">Compliance with EU limits</seg>
<seg id="329">For projects whose total contract value was estimated at more than €5 million ($125 million). The audited contracting entities usually prepared procurement plans specifying which works will be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the procurement plans, the share of work awarded under European rules has always exceeded 80% of total work.</seg>
<seg id="331">There was no case of circumvention of the European management requirement in the form of an excessively low cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, in some cases the minimum share for pan-European management has not been achieved as a result of a calculation error.</seg>
<seg id="333">In the course of carrying out the work, some contracting entities have illegally modified the award plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not justify these changes in any way and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of the European procedure was subsequently respected.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a general rule, the proportion of European procedures under the project accounts was lower than that set out in the procurement plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">If the expected value of construction project contracts exceeded the European limits, contracting authorities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-parts worth more than €1 million (EUR 25 million). CZK).</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving any compelling reasons for the need to derogate from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">SAO</seg>
<seg id="339">Selection of the type of procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, equipment for a major sporting event and housing construction), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="341">The distribution decreased the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding mode or even outside the legal regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods for calculating the expected price</seg>
<seg id="343">The price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="344">They were based on the prices presented in the completed procedures, which were, however, burdened by non-economic and excessive profits for suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price standards.</seg>
<seg id="346">The Ministry of Transport is to update the standards in relation not only to past prices, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.</seg>
<seg id="347">For land construction, the expected price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or the investor estimate.</seg>
<seg id="348">The actual price then differed considerably from the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="349">The expected cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but increased by 54 million in the course of implementation. CZK, i.e. by 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, for the construction of the depositary of this library, the contractual price was 33% lower than the expected price.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased further in the course of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="352">The building of a large library was 400 miles away. CZK, i.e. by 22%. For the construction of the Palace of Justice, the actual price during the construction process increased disproportionately (by 139%) compared to the increase of functional areas (only by 12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summary</seg>
<seg id="354">Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of type of procurement procedure and on the respect of European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national arrangements of both countries are almost identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public proceedings in Germany is stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to a restricted procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public invitation to participate gives the possibility for more competitors to participate in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of tenders that guarantee the best effect of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="358">The prevention of corruption is greatly enhanced as the range of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which gives room for manipulation and price fixation between tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference for open procedures or public calls for participation.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition for contracting authorities to restrict the number of tenderers in restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="362">The restricted procedure has now come very close to an open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authority is largely satisfied with the requirement of an open procedure preference or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law in order to circumvent the requirement to select the relevant type of procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in the case of certain projects carried out in Germany, the European limits were not respected, resulting in a lack of a minimum share in pan-European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="365">A satisfactory system has not yet been put in place in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.</seg>
<seg id="366">Where appropriate, contracting authorities should, through more extensive controls, ensure that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or should create the conditions necessary to enable the expected costs to be calculated correctly.</seg>
<seg id="367">Preliminary information and notice of initiation</seg>

<seg id="381">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="383">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of contracts for which no European procedure is required.</seg>
<seg id="385">The procurement procedure may not be initiated more than one month after the pre-notification has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of preliminary information may be waived only in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="388">In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the federal government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the case of restricted proceedings without competition from participants, the notice must be published where the estimated price of the contract is equal to or greater than € 25,000 (CZK 625 000).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="392">The division of projects into smaller parts is not so frequent in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.</seg>

<seg id="397">In some open procedures, they shortened the time limit, although the number of days between sending the prior notification and sending the contract notice was less than 52 days.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other shortened proceedings, the annual deadlines for prior information have expired and should be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="399">In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the expected division of the works into several parts.</seg>

<seg id="405">It has published a notice on its platform, the use of which has been charged.</seg>
<seg id="406">However, the contracting authority did not check whether this company must comply with the requirement to send further notifications to a free Internet government portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">The sample found that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.</seg>

<seg id="410">During the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set criteria for the construction contractors to reduce the large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure in the contract contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority was unable to substantiate the method of selecting (reducing) the evaluation tenders.</seg>
<seg id="412">The number of tenders was reduced by previous legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the construction of a road circuit, the contracting authority has not defined in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documentation the values according to which it will assess the level of compliance with the qualification criteria or the number of candidates to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the restricted procedure fulfilled it, but excluded one of them with the fulfilment of the last sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="415">The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent as it did not disclose in advance what qualification data would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of calls</seg>
<seg id="417">In the case of construction modifications in former military injuries, the contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to tender in violation of the law.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations/summary</seg>
<seg id="419">A two-step information process with preliminary information and publication of a notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency requirements and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of restricted procedures, both countries increased transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">Contrary to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow all interested potential tenderers to participate.</seg>
<seg id="423">In restricted procedures, the contracting authority shall first select potential suppliers to be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="425">EU provisions allow a limit on the number of applicants in European restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, a restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure for publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently wide to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory and shall be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential candidates to be invited is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. preferences of some of them.</seg>
<seg id="430">Reducing competition to a few candidates can ease their secret agreement.</seg>
<seg id="431">This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting authorities should change the tenderers which are invited to tender.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permissible to restrict competition from a regional perspective.</seg>
<seg id="438">Contracting entities shall document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="439">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, at least three candidates are required to be invited in the event of a restricted procedure and several suitable tenderers in the case of a negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except in two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow to limit the number of candidates addressed in the case of restricted and negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, when selecting candidates, the "four-eyes principle" must be respected.</seg>
<seg id="443">While one worker proposes a list of these, another must substantially modify the proposal, for example by deleting the proposed tenderer or setting up another.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is intended to prevent a situation in which an individual can definitively determine the range of candidates participating in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="445">Where such a provision is not in place, a far-reaching unlawful agreement between participants is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of tenderers to be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="447">This also obliges authorized independent experts.</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic there is no similar measure or measure for the confidential treatment of the list of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="449">According to the German provisions, they may not designate candidates for an external company but may make proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="451">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of candidates</seg>
<seg id="454">Apart from a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of applicants has been met.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of almost 7,000 construction contracts with a value up to the national limit showed that in the case of restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited an average of 6.6 potential tenderers and an average of 4.4 tenderers in the case of direct negotiated procedures.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of suppliers and regional constraints</seg>
<seg id="457">In particular, the contracting authorities did not change the range of contacted tenderers in the area of building construction because they had good experience with those with whom they had cooperated so far.</seg>
<seg id="458">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they were to guarantee that they would reach out to tenderers whose suitability they had already ascertained in advance.</seg>
<seg id="460">Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the non-public tenderers included a larger proportion of regional tenderers than in the case of public proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting authorities explained this by the low level of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-checking principle and proposals by self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">Contracting authorities have generally ignored the obligation to amend the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="464">They argued in particular for staff shortages, time pressures or inadequate knowledge of the suitable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not show who had proposed the candidate who had been asked to participate in the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="466">The examination of some samples showed that the list of potential tenderers was established by self-employed experts and was accepted unchanged by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="467">The contracting authorities thus did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidentiality of treatment of lists of potential tenderers</seg>
<seg id="469">One contracting authority kept a list of tenderers for invitations to tender in a database to which all employees had access at any time.</seg>
<seg id="470">This allowed for manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of presumed or accepted applicants, who could then agree on a price.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">The dossier stated the reasons for the selection of tenderers in only a few cases.</seg>
<seg id="473">SAO</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection criteria for candidates</seg>
<seg id="475">During the construction of the road circuit, interested parties did not have information on what their qualifications would be evaluated and how.</seg>
<seg id="476">For the action related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the contract notice, the criteria for limiting the number of tenderers have not been established.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight tenderers met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="478">The Commission then selected the candidates by random selection method - by drawing lots, which was legal at the time.</seg>
<seg id="479">This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion already in the contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summary</seg>
<seg id="481">In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in limited procurement procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent illegal restrictions on competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by cross-checking (four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidential nature of the list of applicants and by prohibiting bidding on external companies.</seg>
<seg id="483">The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit found that part of the rules in question was not sufficiently applied and that the inadmissible restriction of the scope of the candidates was not prevented in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate these deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="486">Submission of tenders</seg>
<seg id="487">The procurement phase in which potential tenderers may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents they have received begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and/or the invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="488">Until the date of opening of the envelopes, any tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to bid for the award of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authority must comply with the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and avoid potential manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Those provisions relate in particular to organisation and control.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">The principle is that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers draw up their tenders must always be sent by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Design offices interested in management should not perform this role.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the event of confusion in the procurement documents or where further questions arise, only the contracting authority may supply information to tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="499">The design offices responsible for drawing up the procurement documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During this entire phase, any contact between the design office and the applicants must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="501">They must remain anonymous throughout the course because allowing contact with them can adversely affect the competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders sent by post or submitted directly shall be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Electronically submitted tenders shall be encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may mandate insured suppliers of external services to print and distribute documentation, while their employees must be obliged to observe confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, tenders received must be marked with the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in the original state (sealed) to the official responsible for their storage.</seg>
<seg id="507">This worker must not be involved in the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">The menus received must be locked until the envelope opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a serial number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority shall issue a report with information on the contest including the tender number and information on the preparation and receipt of the tender.</seg>

<seg id="518">Information to tenderers</seg>
<seg id="519">For the part of the procurement documents relating to questioning and obtaining information, the contracting authority has not acted under the separate planning rule from the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the project management department.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some tendering notices even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the procurement documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">In rare cases, no identical information was received by tenderers who raised questions during the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="523">Menu Labeling</seg>
<seg id="524">For contracting entities, all tenders received were marked with a stamp and a certificate of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="525">However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed professionals, thereby violating the rule of one corruption prevention structure.</seg>
<seg id="526">Custody of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="527">Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="528">For one contracting authority, tenders were temporarily placed in the open compartment of the filing office to which all employees had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another sponsor placed the mailbox in the hallway without permanent supervision, and part of the bids thrown into the mailbox stayed there overnight.</seg>
<seg id="530">The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, so it was accessible not only to employees.</seg>

<seg id="532">The SAO did not identify shortcomings in this area.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summary</seg>
<seg id="534">In both countries, rules are laid down to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices that cooperate in the procurement procedure, throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all applicants.</seg>
<seg id="536">Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are appropriate for the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of offers.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="545">The European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on opening envelopes.</seg>

<seg id="554">Offers received late may not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this phase must be recorded in writing, including the conclusions (results). The record shall include, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.</seg>

<seg id="564">The manager and, in the case of civil engineering, the registrar shall not be participants in the preparatory phase (preparation of the procurement documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and may not be members in the subsequent processing (procedure) of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="565">German regulations require that envelope opening entries include not only bid prices, but also all information on discounts and special (unusual) signs, such as damaged envelopes on receipt or late bids.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic there must be an indication of the language of the tender and the signature of the tenderer in addition to the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="567">German legislation requires all parts of the envelopes to be marked in order to avoid subsequent changes.</seg>
<seg id="568">Tenders, typically marked as perforations indicating the date, must be kept confidential (secret) after opening the envelopes and may only be made available to persons processing them further.</seg>
<seg id="569">Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="570">If a single offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.</seg>

<seg id="588">Summary</seg>
<seg id="589">In both countries, substantial parts of the envelope opening provisions are identical with respect to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, thus enabling the risk of corruption and manipulation to be substantially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more comprehensive compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="591">The marking, safe preservation and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes to the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="592">Moreover, the staff responsible for opening envelopes shall not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">Despite the detection of some irregularities, the findings confirm that the rules on opening envelopes are largely applied.</seg>
<seg id="594">Assessment and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority shall examine and evaluate tenders received within a specified time limit.</seg>
<seg id="596">It must also award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law sets out the process for assessing and evaluating tenders in several steps:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to check the suitability of the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="600">They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="601">Tenderers who have sometimes been legally convicted of bribery or defrauding must always be excluded from procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="602">Non-excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable tender and in particular examine all significantly low price offers.</seg>
<seg id="604">Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For example, tenderers may be excluded for no legitimate reason, or tenders which do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The outcome of the evaluation may be improperly influenced by the preference or disadvantage of a tenderer, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority must therefore take special measures to select the persons involved in the process and ensure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">They also need to make sure that the process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require review and evaluation of tenders in step-by-step steps.</seg>
<seg id="612">During the evaluation, the requirements for documenting the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weights as set out in the notice or tender documents shall not be amended.</seg>
<seg id="613">The criteria laid down for assessing the suitability of tenderers cannot be further applied.</seg>
<seg id="614">Further evaluation may only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view as to whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements which could encourage manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of tenders submitted by them, they shall be informed thereof without delay.</seg>
<seg id="617">Where the evaluation of tenders results in the finding of a disproportionately low bid price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation prior to the possible withdrawal of his bid.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.</seg>
<seg id="619">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, candidates must remain confidential and only beneficiaries can participate in the evaluation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may review the mathematical accuracy of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="622">Only employees who are not included in the decision-making phase of the selection of the supplier or in the implementation phase of the project may be assigned to the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="624">If external companies are entrusted with the examination and evaluation of tenders, they must be aware that the tenders are confidential and honestly respect this fact.</seg>
<seg id="625">They may only make proposals to the contracting authority for a decision.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic, tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by a commission appointed by the contracting authority to prepare a report on the draft conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="627">However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="628">If in Germany the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="629">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="630">If tenderers do not comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.</seg>
<seg id="632">If the candidate does not submit them, they must be expelled.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany it is necessary to examine not only the total price but also the unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the offer shows that the prices for parts of the overall project have been estimated to be disproportionately high or low, the tenderers must be asked for an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="635">Where they do not submit an explanation and where the contracting authority can demonstrate that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders shall be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is intended to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to each part of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of the parts are not examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="638">Valuation compensation is not a reason for excluding the offer.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a price that is disproportionately high or low.</seg>
<seg id="640">If one or more tenders differ in price by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the Czech Republic, the tender procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and tenderers have not justified these prices.</seg>
<seg id="643">If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the estimate of the contracting authority, this does not justify the refusal to award the contract to the tenderer concerned (as opposed to German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">Where there is a suspicion of conduct in Germany to restrict competition, the contracting authority shall immediately report that fact to the competent superior authority.</seg>
<seg id="645">It must decide on the way forward and if it is appropriate to inform the antitrust or law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="646">It also has to approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest bidder) whether the contract will be awarded during the contract or whether the award procedure will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not regulate this area.</seg>
<seg id="648">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Verification of suitability and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most of the procurement procedures examined complied with the relevant requirements.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of certain recommendations of potential suppliers made by self-employed persons, contracting authorities themselves have not checked the suitability of tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="653">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="654">In some cases, procurement procedures have not provided sufficient documentation as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria at the time of selection or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of interested parties and confidentiality of offers</seg>
<seg id="656">Some contracting entities used the services of unauthorised persons, such as self-employed workers or employees of building offices.</seg>
<seg id="657">They were integrated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions to be held solely by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The contracting authorities sought to justify this fact with their insufficient human resources in the sector.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to review the service offerings of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to carry out with due care the fulfilment of their obligations under the contract.</seg>
<seg id="660">As far as contracting authorities are concerned, there was generally no conclusive record of whether tenders in the custody of self-employed professionals were only available to designated persons.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and mathematical control of tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting entities have forwarded open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals, without first conducting the prescribed examination of tenders and mathematical review and without documenting the results of those screenings.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the event of any intention of manipulation, third parties could make changes to tenders which could not be identified by the contracting entity.</seg>
<seg id="664">The examination of the documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately labelled or where price and product data were missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A model check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from the predicted costs.</seg>
<seg id="667">One of the 20 procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tendering prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In many cases there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of tenders or negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there was also a lack of detailed information on, for example, unit prices of the most important invoiced items.</seg>
<seg id="670">Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as the reason for the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The contracting authorities have resisted the difficulty of identifying and demonstrating countervailing prices.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one invitation to tender made by an entity outside the scope of normal contracting authorities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="673">Data on closer cost verification or determination of reasons for derogations have not been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="674">In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping for the tenderer to which the contract would potentially be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">It was therefore not clarified whether the original cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contracting authority rated this tenderer as a "low-cost company" which was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the initial cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">The contracting authority did not cancel the procurement procedure and made the unfounded argument that the tenderer concerned could be presumed not to have based its pricing on disproportionately high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspected irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found in one contracting entity and were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing an identical price calculation, prompting the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The checks did not show any substantial shortcomings in the application of other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">SAO</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">For many construction events, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of the contracting authority specified in the procurement terms or did not demonstrate the qualifications to the extent required, or, conversely, one contracting authority was unable to substantiate or explain the reason for the withdrawal of the candidate who met the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">For the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, individual evaluation criteria of the procurement procedure for the contractor of the construction were established, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="688">For the railway infrastructure development action, the weighting of the award evaluation criteria was not established at the start of the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">For the road repair project, the evaluation of the "shortening of construction time" criterion was not performed correctly.</seg>
<seg id="690">For candidates in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly indicated a reduction in construction time than indicated in their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the tenderer</seg>
<seg id="692">For the three actions linked to housing support, the contracting authority did not demonstrate on the basis of which criteria it assessed the tenders received and how it selected the most appropriate of them.</seg>
<seg id="693">The correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts linked to the construction of a road circuit with a projected price up to 500 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="694">CZK could not be verified as the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations about the price and date of delivery, but the documents about these negotiations were not prepared.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summary</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for verifying and evaluating tenders correspond to EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with regard to the specific steps of the procedure and the selection of individuals involved in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="698">Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these procurement process steps are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially with regard to the application of the cross-principle and the protection of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries, checks have been found in some cases that the essential steps of the process in verifying and evaluating tenders have not been documented at all and, if so, only partially.</seg>
<seg id="701">The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders enables manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="702">The checks showed serious deficiencies, such as the submission of tenders to third parties without proper prior examination and documenting of tenders by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of the functions associated with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and enhanced control of the measures against the increased possibility of manipulation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="704">In all cases, the audited German contracting authorities did not use the complete set of available instruments and did not deal with their own price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, weaknesses were identified in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the use of evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the procurement procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">Following the examination and evaluation of tenders, the procurement process shall be completed by the award of the contract or the cancellation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="709">In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.</seg>
<seg id="710">Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request a review where appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="712">The period of 10 days shall apply to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.</seg>
<seg id="713">The contract may not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the decision of the examination procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law reviewed by an independent court.</seg>
<seg id="715">This measure ensures that no contracting entity will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by swiftly implementing the procurement decision.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority shall document the procedure accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented information obligations for management.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">However, it cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly conducted review and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority shall conclude the contract within a specified period of time.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reason is that the tenderer is not bound by his bid after the expiry of this deadline.</seg>
<seg id="724">The contents of the contract shall not deviate from the winning bid.</seg>
<seg id="725">The unsuccessful tenderers should be informed of the result in good time, stating why their bid was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">Cancellation of the procurement procedure is only permissible if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the tenders do not conform to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Different provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the mandatory pre-contract waiting period of 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, equivalent provisions apply only to European procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before deciding on its EU provisions and the review award.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only one tender meets the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, a contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender meets the conditions laid down in the procurement documents and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Main control findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">Few irregularities were found in the completion of controlled procurement processes.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases, European procedures have been granted to letter companies prior to the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also, in several open procedures, the authorising letters contained modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new time limits.</seg>
<seg id="738">In some cases, contracting authorities have failed to meet the award deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="739">In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the tenderer offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the price originally offered.</seg>
<seg id="740">SAO</seg>
<seg id="741">During the reconstruction and construction of the university, the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tender of the selected tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="742">For some road repair and maintenance operations, the construction of the motorway and the road circuit, contracts were concluded later than laid down by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">In the case of construction modifications in former military injuries, the contracting authority has sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all tenderers only after the expiry of the legal period.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summary</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented EU rules on the closure of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Czech Public Procurement Act includes an institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limited contract time limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In the future, contracting authorities should eliminate such shortcomings when concluding the procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notifications, information obligations</seg>
<seg id="752">The procurement process with all its individual stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="753">The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.</seg>
<seg id="754">Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in line with the basic requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only sound and timely documentation on decision-making and rationale guarantees transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.</seg>
<seg id="758">Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to give detailed reasons for individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify their completion to the EU Publications Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the award date.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and the transparency requirement is fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authority must summarise the relevant information on its procurement procedures and communicate it to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics to provide an overview of the development of the single market in construction.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Same or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have fully transposed the provisions of the European Law on Documentation and Notification Obligations into their national legislation.</seg>

<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify a contract does not only apply to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those compulsory under European law, applies only to restricted procedures exceeding the threshold of EUR 25 000 (CZK 625 000) and direct procedures exceeding the threshold of EUR 15 000 (CZK 375 000), including VAT.</seg>

<seg id="777">In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority has not explained why it entered into a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain mandatory formalities.</seg>
<seg id="778">In several cases, some of the required records were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of the award of the contract</seg>

<seg id="801">Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summary evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">Parallel controls of the SAO and BRH focused on two areas that are essential for the procurement process in both the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">EU legislation provides an opportunity for international competition within the EU to create a single European market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures aimed at preventing corruption are not merely aimed at avoiding or at least reducing corruption, but at the same time at preventing financial damage and possible loss of confidence in government integrity.</seg>
<seg id="806">The findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and the BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of the two countries and the comparison of their respective provisions give an internal view of the common and different elements that can assist both countries in the further development and application of this law.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="809">In both countries there is thus an important common basis for public procurement and for meeting the essential requirements in the field of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="810">Contracting authorities reinforce these requirements partly through very extensive measures.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has laid down provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures and procedures that are below the EU limits and is therefore governed by national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, checks have shown that contracting entities are not always fully compliant with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="813">German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate these irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, controls identified risks affecting the economy and achieving value for money.</seg>
<seg id="815">It is in particular an incomplete definition of the subject matter of the contract, which resulted in additional work, which was often awarded in violation of the law, insufficient definition of the expected price and the required qualification assumptions narrowing the possible range of tenderers and thus reducing competition in particular in the field of transport construction.</seg>
<seg id="816">Prevention of corruption</seg>
<seg id="817">Joint controls were not intended to detect cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">The reason was that both the BRH and the SAO did not have the tools to do so.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, they can check whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">As regards the prevention of corruption, the two countries focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">In particular, the German provisions provide for wide and unrestricted competition, transparency and control as a central element in preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="822">In particular, Czech regulations aim to strengthen transparency of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been included in public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, occasionally and very precisely, ways of meeting the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and of selecting the persons included therein.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the view of the BRH, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the cross-checking principle), transparency requirements, procurement documentation and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">Therefore, BRH does not feel the need to substantially amend the current provisions that public institutions must comply with when awarding public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">Irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, contracting entities should provide further training to their employees, thereby enriching them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.</seg>
<seg id="833">A significant part of the identified weaknesses refers to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, the lack of adequate controls in delegating powers increases the risk of their abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Therefore, activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">SAO</seg>
<seg id="837">In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at government level, which significantly affect the field of public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">Audits of the SAO took place during the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely a significant change of the Act on Public Procurement and the adoption of successive implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="839">The strategy adopted and the new legislation can be effective steps to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="840">Under the new rules, for example, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the contract, the determination of the estimated value of the contract, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders, and properly document and publish everything.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">Overall, both the SAO and the BRH have a favourable opinion on how to implement EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="843">Their broad application has confirmed in practice that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency requirements form an appropriate basis for EU public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="844">The transnational model, introduced in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">Taking into account the large potential for material and intangible damage resulting from manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the obligation of the contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisational structures and procurement processes should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for correction.</seg>
<seg id="847">In comparison with the practice in Germany, it appeared that the share of open procurement procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, giving room for competition and substantially reducing the possibility of corrupt behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="848">In cases where this is permissible and appropriate for contracting entities, partial procurement may also have a positive impact on the price achieved. The higher number of applicants puts pressure on the price achieved.</seg>
<seg id="849">The organisation of the procurement procedure is also affected.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, it is provided by special state organizations, whereas in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport constructions, it is organized by central authorities themselves or through contractual organizations.</seg>
<seg id="851">Both the SAO and the BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where appropriate and to address it with their parliament and government, beyond their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions. (INTOSAI), because these principles and findings are of general importance for the effective fight against corruption and for the guarantee that public contracts are awarded in a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that value for money is achieved.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF PARALLEL CONTROLS OF EXCISE ADMINISTRATION IN SR AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint final report</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="7">The submitted joint report informs on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, focusing on the administration of excise duties in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the performance of parallel controls aimed at the administration of excise taxes, which was concluded in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The theme of parallel controls was selected on the basis of the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation in order to determine how it is applied at national level, how the system of excise tax administration is set up and how the systems in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic differ.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefit of the control actions was the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Finally, it was beneficial to find that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise tax management is very limited without the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>

<seg id="17">Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="18">on the results of parallel inspections of SPD management in SR and CR</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration is in accordance with EU law and significantly exceeds EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences were found between the excise tax treatment in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, the verification of the economic stability of applicants for authorisation and the compulsory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and certain other oils contributes to the effective administration of excise taxes; In SR, the distribution of control stamps is easier than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome to the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against excise evasion, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials, implementation of the Institute of the Fuel Distributor and registration of retailers of consumer packaging of alcohol proved to be good practice in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Excise revenue in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing environmental austerity measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, including because there is no indexation of excise duty rates in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has the effect of reducing the importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, of reducing the tax burden on excise duties in real terms.</seg>
<seg id="26">The State has supported the implementation of environmental measures in the long term, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenue, which will therefore need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or reductions in State expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure incurred in the administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been increasing in the long term, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">In SR, this efficiency is also negatively affected by expenditure on electronisation of excise tax administration (IT expenditure) and expenses incurred on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The electronisation of excise tax administration in SR did not materially reflect the reduction in the number of tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="30">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR recommend that FŘ SR reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditure was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the audited period that would reduce the staffing requirements of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The number of comparable administrative acts of the tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities is about a third lower in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic place emphasis on remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of excise taxes in the Slovak Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and, due to the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities, more costly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Electronisation of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise tax returns is fully electronized; in the Czech Republic, documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both methods of electronization support effective administration of excise taxes, which is why the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The total expenditure for the implementation of the EMCS could not be compared as FŘ SR provided expenditure data only for the upgrade of the system in 2011-2015, but the expenditure was also spent before that period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenses incurred during that period only for the EMCS upgrade were approximately 20% higher in the Slovak Republic than those incurred in the Czech Republic for both the EMCS and the system upgrade over more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when incurring comparable expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the Slovak Republic the management of excise duties is significantly more resource intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">The introduction of the Electronic System for Monitoring the Movement of Excise Products (EMCS) has made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but in the Slovak Republic to a lower extent, as significantly higher expenditure was incurred on the introduction and modernisation of the system than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">Cooperation between the two audit institutions was carried out on the basis of the Cooperation Treaty in the implementation of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties of 18.8.2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR agreed to carry out parallel checks, which will be primarily focused on the issue of excise tax administration and the results of which will allow analysis, comparison and evaluation of the findings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel checks were based.</seg>
<seg id="47">Characteristics of subject matter and objectives of parallel control:</seg>
<seg id="48">The aim of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise administrators taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and to identify weaknesses in the excise management process.</seg>
<seg id="49">In particular, the following main audit questions should be answered:</seg>
<seg id="50">Were excise administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieving comparable values of qualitative indicators when incurring comparable expenditure?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has the introduction of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) system made excise duty management more efficient and has the implementation expenses efficiently incurred?</seg>
<seg id="52">The parallel checks should have identified the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of legislation and in setting up the organisational structure.</seg>

<seg id="68">Legislation for excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">Excise legislation is divided into EU legislation (see Annex 1) and national legislation (see Annex 2).</seg>
<seg id="70">Council Directive 2008/118/ES, on the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EHS, defines excise duty and defines the basic rules for the administration and management of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This Directive allows for the imposition of consumption taxes on other products.</seg>
<seg id="72">In particular, EU legislation provides for minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for the different types of products selected, the production, storage, processing and holding of taxable products, the taxation, exemption and refund, supervision of transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation allows control procedures and institutes to be implemented at national level, provided they do not distort competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Excise legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, excise legislation is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of mineral oil taxes, alcohol taxes, taxes on tobacco products, beer taxes, taxes on wine and intermediate products and taxes on raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="77">This Act defines the forms of handling of excise products, taxpayers, authorisation procedures, conditions for the transport of products, tax returns and penalties for infringements.</seg>
<seg id="78">The Act and subsequent Decrees further regulate certain other conditions for the management of mineral oils (branding of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No. 261/2007 Coll., on the stabilization of public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are contained in special legislation. Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulates the conditions for the sale, supply, distribution of fuel and the keeping of records of fuel put into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No. 61/1997 Coll., on alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No. 307/2013 Coll., on the compulsory labelling of alcohol, and the relevant implementing provisions provide for compulsory labelling of alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for the handling of control tapes and conditions for the handling of alcohol (i.e. for the production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, taking over, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).</seg>
<seg id="83">Tax procedures not specified in special regulations are governed by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Penalties are imposed by procedures under Act No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for issuing a trade licence (concession) for the operation of the trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, preparation and sale of yeast alcohol, spirit and spirits" are regulated by Act No. 455/1991 Coll., on the Business Enterprise (Trade Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic has used the authorization to introduce control procedures and institutes for controlling the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to supervise compliance with legislation in the handling of selected products for which no excise duty has been paid, as well as in the handling of selected products for which the tax has already been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">These include monitoring the handling of specific mineral oils and raw tobacco, labelling of certain other mineral oils, labelling of tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic used the right to apply excise duty to other products and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of changes to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">On the basis of the Czech Government's Resolution of 3 October 2012 No 735, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market in spirits," in 2012-2015 in the Czech Republic there were major legislative adjustments which introduced a number of measures against tax fraud on alcohol excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="91">During the same period, there were major changes in the legislation concerning the mineral oil tax, the tobacco tax and the criminality of preparing tax cuts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal protection of tax revenues</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1.7.2016, the criminality of the preparation of the offence of "tax reduction, fee and similar compulsory payments" is introduced. The modifications made should allow police authorities to take more effective and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, such as the deployment of operational search resources.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions for the administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="95">The issue of authorisations for the treatment of excise products under the Excise Duty Act shall be subject to: reliability with effect from the 1.1.2015; indebtedness; economic stability; authorisations to operate a trade enabling the performance of an authorisation-related activity; situations where the appellant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">The aim of the legislation was in particular to address the issue of the creation of tax arrears by reducing entities authorised to handle products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="97">The economic stability condition newly allows the tax administrator to take account of the financial situation of tax entities both in the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation has been issued.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities with insufficient financial revenue to properly discharge their tax obligations from handling selected products.</seg>
<seg id="99">To assess the economic stability of the proposer, indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) have been established on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax administrator depends on the individual conditions of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Act stipulates the periodicity of the examination of the fulfilment of the economic stability condition due to the timeliness of the data - the examination takes place once a year following the deadline for submission of the income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="102">The tax administrator has the possibility to set other conditions necessary for the administration of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the holder of the authorisation does not fulfil the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the authorisation or cancel it with delay.</seg>
<seg id="104">Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of the tax security (e.g. repeat recipient).</seg>
<seg id="105">The authorisation was revoked by 10 entities, the other applicants increased the tax security, capitalised their contribution to the company or supported the current accounting data according to which they already fulfilled all the conditions for issuing the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="106">In addition to the appellant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must be met by a natural person who is a statutory body or a member, or by a natural person who is not a statutory body of the appellant or a member of the appellant, but carries on such activity (chain of legal persons in the position of statutory body or its member, so-called linked entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, more than 30 000 linked entities had been screened.</seg>
<seg id="108">Records kept under the Excise Tax Act (Sections 37 to Section 40 and Section 60 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) include information on:</seg>
<seg id="109">the type, name, code and quantity of goods produced, taken over, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment (contingent exemption scheme, importation, re-entry into the suspension scheme, export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of the event and the registration;</seg>
<seg id="111">transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, transport numbers);</seg>
<seg id="112">the registration numbers of the related documents;</seg>
<seg id="113">notification of the entry into free circulation of the alcohol in the consumer package marked with the control tape and of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="114">The record of take-over after transport must be made immediately after its termination.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of a record maintained electronically, the record must be kept or allowed to be output in xls, xlsx, ods.</seg>
<seg id="116">Alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, diagram A) from the production of raw alcohol to the labelling of the control tape to its distribution to the final seller or authorised user of exempt alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, both the customs authorities and the production facilities for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation, are subject to supervision.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify people handling liquor in consumer packaging, to reduce the treatment of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are: The records of the production, receipt, stocks and dispensation of alcohol contain information on the quantity of alcohol according to the various stages of production and processing of alcohol with the identification of the document numbers.</seg>
<seg id="121">Restrictions on the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and on the number of packages with broken control tape at the place of final sale or issue to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other packaging of a volume of max. one litre or three litres if it is a container made of glass.</seg>
<seg id="123">Spirits in larger packaging are regarded as unmarked, which are forbidden to dispose of.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of final sale to the natural person for his personal consumption may be max. one consumer package with broken control tape, or three, if fitted with a one-way valve.</seg>
<seg id="125">Compulsory registration of a person who places alcohol in consumer packaging products with at least 15% vol. of alcohol in free circulation and is: an importer of alcohol, a producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or an operator of a tax warehouse under suspension, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="126">Personal conditions - reliability, integrity and non-expression of prohibition - must be met by the applicant and the person in the position of statutory authority or responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="127">The applicant must grant bail of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approximately €3,700 to €185,000) depending on the estimated amount of control tapes collected.</seg>
<seg id="128">Technical conditions for registration are an appropriate place for marking the alcohol and equipment of the marking or tax warehouse by a camera tracking device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="129">The registration marking of the control tape is introduced for the marking of spirits of more than 0,06 litres.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the case of transport of control belts, the registration mark of the control belts shall appear on the transport documents or export declaration.</seg>
<seg id="131">The control tape for the 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code which included a four-digit registration sampling number, the application code for assignment of the control tapes and the classification code according to the level of ethanol volume concentration.</seg>
<seg id="132">The control tape from 1. 12. 2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in the consumer package expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 ° C, rounded to the whole millilitres downwards.</seg>
<seg id="133">The registration of control tapes for the marking of spirits contains daily records of the different methods of handling the control tapes according to the registration codes as well as documents on the basis of which the registration took place.</seg>
<seg id="134">In the event of the destruction, loss or theft of specific control belts, their holder shall notify the tax administrator by electronic means of the registration code of the control belts concerned and their number the following working day after the operative event.</seg>
<seg id="135">Introduction of a new substance of offences and adjustment of the level of penalties imposed for infringements in the handling of surveillance tapes.</seg>
<seg id="136">Penalties may be imposed up to or exceeding the excise duty (e.g. in the event of destruction or loss of control belts in the number exceeding 0.1% of the total quantity of the individual control tape order carried out, if the check tape is not returned within the statutory period).</seg>
<seg id="137">Limitation of handling of control tapes only to registered holders who may not refer them to another person, except to provide them to a foreign supplier for the purpose of labelling spirits in consumer packaging produced outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">The control tapes exported must be placed on consumer packaging and re-imported no later than nine months after taking over from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="139">Compulsory registration of the distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging provided the fulfilment of personal conditions similar to that of the person obliged to mark the alcohol and with the obligation to deposit up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approximately €185,000).</seg>
<seg id="140">Definition of persons for the sale or purchase of alcohol in consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="141">Beneficiaries are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or final sellers, or to sell it as a final seller.</seg>
<seg id="142">They may acquire alcohol from other registered persons, the insolvency administrator, the administrative body, the organisational units of the state or unregistered persons in the exercise of tax execution.</seg>
<seg id="143">Notices of entry into free circulation of alcohol or sales in consumer packaging shall be sent by the holders and distributors of alcohol immediately on the following day following the operative event to the tax administrator through the information system led by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or following the content in xml format.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification shall include the number of control tapes used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the percentage by volume of alcohol, the European Goods Code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or the final seller as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.</seg>
<seg id="145">Tax entities sent approximately 10.5 million in 2014 and 2015. notification.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compulsory concession (specific form of trade licence) not only for the production and treatment of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in consumer packaging by the entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or business natural person for his own internal use.</seg>
<seg id="147">Licensed trades may be exercised only after a decision has been taken by the Trade Licensing Office, subject to professional competence and other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="148">No prescribed competence is required for the sale of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="149">The tax administrator benefits from an overview of sellers and their establishments and restrictions</seg>
<seg id="150">trading on reliable entities.</seg>
<seg id="151">In the Czech Republic, for the field of production, preparation of yeast alcohol, spirits, spirits and other alcoholic beverages, sales were registered in the year 2014 approx. 94 thousand and in the year 2015 about 104 thousand concessions.</seg>
<seg id="152">During their activities outside the tax administrations, the following include: Trade authorities, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the Czech Financial Administration, the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.</seg>
<seg id="153">If it finds that there has been an infringement or breach of the prohibition, it shall immediately inform the excise administrator thereof.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, scheme B), to which mineral oils burdened by excise duty are subject, but also selected mineral oils unburdened by excise duties that have been used for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes supervision from production of mineral oil through storage, transport, marking and colouring of selected mineral oils, branding of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and in some cases to consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">Customs supervision shall include the production and handling of markers for the labelling of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="158">The marking and colouring of the selected mineral oils shall be subject to the mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (other kerosene), 2710 19 29 (other not elsewhere specified medium oils) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49, unless their marking is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">For example, benzol, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion are subject to the labelling of certain other mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="160">The marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils by branding is possible only under the permission of the tax administration.</seg>

<seg id="163">The most significant new measures since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion) whose kinematic viscosity at 40 ° C is less than 12 mm2 s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following: the flash point is less than 150 ° C, distilling at least 20 per cent of the volume including losses up to 350 ° C during the distillation test.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils have been misused as an additive to finished fuels, in particular diesel fuel, or have been directly used or sold for motor propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Entities handling monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres shall register with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="167">The personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory authority and the responsible representative shall be fulfilled for the issue of the registration, which shall be valid throughout the period 2 Except for beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.</seg>

<seg id="170">registration.</seg>
<seg id="171">As of 30 December 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, at the suggestion of the marketing authorisation holder, four registrations were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="172">The electronic record shall contain detailed information on the receipt, consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil, including document numbers, notification numbers of acquisition by the tax authorities, storage and consumption places, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption or, on sale, place of delivery and registration number of the customer.</seg>
<seg id="173">The notification of any acquisition of special mineral oil shall be made to the tax administrator between 24 and 72 hours before receipt.</seg>
<seg id="174">The identification of the trading partners, the name and nomenclature of the special mineral oil, the quantity, the purpose of consumption or the information on sale or transfer shall be notified.</seg>
<seg id="175">Notifications of the estimated quantity in the relevant year of mineral oil acquired, sold or consumed shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the calendar year concerned.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notices of use and marking, place of storage or consumption, identification details of the person to whom the special mineral oil is further sold or transferred shall be transmitted before any change.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications shall be made electronically via intelligent forms or by a data box in the PDF format.</seg>
<seg id="178">In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.</seg>
<seg id="179">Securing and forfeiture of special mineral oils or means of transport, if applicable, must be declared by the tax administrator in cases where it detects the treatment of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to fulfil his notification obligation.</seg>
<seg id="180">As in the case of non-compliance with obligations for the transport of excise products, these deficiencies cannot be remedied additionally.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of the fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are entitled to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Only persons meeting the following criteria may be registered fuel distributors:</seg>
<seg id="183">Compulsory concession of the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="184">The customs office examining whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory authority or the members of the statutory authority of the applicant - the legal person and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of reliability - shall provide an opinion on the application for the concession or, where appropriate, on the appointment of the responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="185">Where such persons fulfil the condition of reliability, the customs office shall issue an agreed opinion.</seg>
<seg id="186">A reliable person is a person of integrity, in terms of criminal property character, customs and tax law.</seg>
<seg id="187">The issue of a concession shall be subject to professional competence.</seg>
<seg id="188">Indebtedness of the same range of persons as in the case of reliability.</seg>
<seg id="189">The debtor is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will fulfil his payment obligations to the State properly and in a timely manner, i.e. he does not have arrears to the State budget and to general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">A fuel distributor shall not be prohibited by a court or administrative authority from carrying out an activity that prevents it from performing its activities.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fuel distributor shall not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="192">Deposit deposit (or bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. approximately €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 after three years of registration of the fuel distributor and fulfilment of other conditions (i.e. approximately €370,000).</seg>
<seg id="193">The distributor shall submit the fuel distribution notification to the customs office within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">Electronic notifications shall include information on individual purchases and sales of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="195">The notified data are data on business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, place of loading and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="196">The entitlement to refund of the tax on mineral oils consumed in agricultural primary production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">Refunds of excise duty on mineral oils may be claimed only in respect of an activity which appears to be related to an activity carried out on land.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015 there were approximately 64 thousand claims for refund totalling CZK 1 172 844 680 (i.e. €43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">Since 2017, the Government of the Czech Republic has also introduced the refund of excise duty on fuel to farmers with livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="200">Farmers or breeders, such as cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats, will be newly able to apply this right.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restrictions on the sale of old-rate tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term lack of budget revenue from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic, with effect from 1 December 2014, introduced restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with an old tax rate in the event of a change in the tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid using tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="205">Using a tobacco sticker means placing it on a unit package (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">For the application of the excise duty rate, the production of the tobacco product is decisive in a state intended for the final consumer, without having to be removed, delivered, dispatched or sold or sold to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="207">The alphabet letter characterising the rate of excise duty is indicated on the tobacco sticker together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, and the sticker indicates the number of packages and the quantity of tobacco to be smoked in kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="208">Tobacco sticker has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The duration of the transitional period for the sale of unit packages of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco sticker bearing the previous (old) rate of taxation has been fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month following the entry into force of the new excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">The development of tobacco sticker withdrawals in 2014 and the comparison with previous years show that tobacco product manufacturers have significantly frontloaded tobacco products with an "old" tax rate each year, thereby effectively shifting the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Raw tobacco tax</seg>
<seg id="212">As a result of the abuse of raw tobacco for the manufacture of tobacco products without the authorisation of the tax administration and the non-enforcement of excise duty, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring of the handling of raw tobacco has been introduced as a measure against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">With effect from 1.7.2015, excise duty shall be subject to raw tobacco which has not been used or delivered for the manufacture of tobacco products, delivered to another Member State or third country or for which the origin, purpose or person to whom raw tobacco has been or is to be supplied has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="214">Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="215">Measures such as surveillance of the transport and manufacture of tobacco products, labelling of unit packs with control tape and restrictions on sales at designated locations have been supplemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="216">Production facilities for processing tobacco raw materials and manufacture of tobacco products shall not be subject to customs supervision.</seg>
<seg id="217">Only registered persons may store raw tobacco for purposes other than the manufacture of tobacco, but such tobacco may not be further processed or modified.</seg>
<seg id="218">Only a person fulfilling the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory authority and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which is valid throughout the registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The conditions of registration are: (a) the authorisation to operate a trade enabling the activities of a person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) indebtedness, (d) the fact that a person storing raw tobacco has not been prohibited from carrying out his activities, (e) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) granting bail of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. approximately €740,000).</seg>
<seg id="220">The electronic record shall include the date of receipt or dispatch of raw tobacco, the document number, identification of the trading partner, the quantity and type of raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco shall be made to the tax administrator between 24 and 72 hours before receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">The details of the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the storage address, the purpose of use and the carrier data shall be reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">Notifications of the quantity foreseen for the relevant year of raw tobacco accepted or dispatched shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the calendar year concerned.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications shall be submitted electronically by the data box in the format of The ERC.</seg>
<seg id="225">The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed requirements.</seg>
<seg id="226">Legislation of excise duties in SR</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating excise duties in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation and thus complements its single tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">The various types of excise duties are taxed by the Slovak legislation, which is similar to the legislation of the surrounding countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Definition of legislation in the SR</seg>
<seg id="230">The excise legislation is provided by four laws according to the subject matter of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonisation was achieved by adopting the following excise laws: Act No 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 C. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All excise laws are rules of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject of excise duties in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No. 563/2009 Z. z., on the administration of taxes (tax code), is a rule of procedural law, regulates the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">This legal framework transposed the various provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/ES of 16 December 2008 on the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EHS and transposed the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European Community.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of amendments to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of control in the SR</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, the legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="237">In the EMCS, the transport monitoring of selected excise products under the suspension scheme was changed from a documentary administrative accompanying document to an exclusively electronic system where such transport is monitored in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">The EMCS electronic system introduced in 2015 an institute to suspend tax access to EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="239">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="240">The customs office has the possibility to suspend access precisely in the event of a justified fear of non-payment or undetermined tax on previous tax periods and its non-enforceability.</seg>
<seg id="241">This relates to the maturity of the tax, since the transport of excise goods requires the composition of the collateral, which is released by termination of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="243">A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="244">The marked gas oil, also commonly called red naphtha, was one of the mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, red diesel was used for specific legal purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The aim of the abolition of red diesel was to reduce the general government deficit, simplify the system of mineral oil taxation and reduce the administrative burden on the businesses concerned.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal change was to introduce a record keeping obligation for all service stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">Clarification of the movements of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, new tax institutes were introduced, namely the fuel distributor and the fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This amendment contributed to eliminating tax evasion for petrol and diesel and made the movement of these fuels more transparent (see Annex 4, Diagram A).</seg>
<seg id="253">As part of the fight against tax evasion, legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils have been extended.</seg>
<seg id="254">However, in the SR, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to designate an indication substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">In the fight against tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw materials, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Material Act was expanded and a new tax entity was introduced - the tobacco raw material trader.</seg>
<seg id="257">Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Furthermore, the obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products has been introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for labelling consumer packages of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">Cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco are labelled with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="261">Under the new system, the customer of the stamps must request the customs office to issue the stamps electronically by means of an information system for the collection of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="262">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state stamp printer was set up - in Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="264">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of control stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new system of printing control stamps strengthens the system of inspection of goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, through which it is easy to verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">The unique 12-digit identification number (1-2 place) shall be the checksum; the third place determines whether the code belongs to a check stamp or to a group of packages; the 4th place is the identifier of the series; 5.-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12 place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">The cigarette labelling mark shall also indicate the price of cigarettes, the indication for the excise duty rate, the number of cigarette units in the consumer package and the length of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer because the original three rules of substantive law were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The Act was drafted primarily because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxation of alcoholic beverages, solutions to their production, monitoring of movements, provision of taxes, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline the performance of tax administration, reduce administrative burdens for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="272">A new way of addressing the taxation of different types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform excise duty rate to alcoholic beverages, taking into account the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="273">For still wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of the actual alcoholic strength by volume of the finished product shall be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration of beer shall also be expressed in volume per cent of the actual alcoholic strength by volume of the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="275">A category of small-scale producer of fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty a natural person who produces sparkling fermented beverage for his own consumption and for the consumption of his household of no more than 1000 litres per marketing year.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for labelling consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under the new system, the customer of the stamps must request the customs office to issue the stamps electronically by means of an information system for the collection of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="278">This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state stamp printer was set up - in Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="280">The exercise of tax supervision over the printing of control stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, diagram B) and the elimination of control stamp falsification.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new system of printing control stamps strengthens the system of inspection of goods, because a unique identification number is generated on the stamp, through which it is easy to verify whether the goods come from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">The unique 12-digit identification number (1-2 place) shall be the checksum; the third place determines whether the code belongs to a check stamp or to a group of packages; the 4th place is the identifier of the series; 5.-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9-12 place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duties on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common law no. 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Tax on solid fuels, tax on natural gas and certain other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">By contrast, in the SR, each excise duty is regulated by a special law, except the Excise Duty on Alcoholic Beverages Act, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the Czech Republic from 1 January 2015, the issuance of an excise product authorisation under the Excise Tax Act is conditional, inter alia, on the demonstration of the economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities annually verify by conducting a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce the tax security.</seg>
<seg id="292">FŘ SR exercises tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control stamps for the labelling of alcohol and tobacco products, their liquidation in the printing works and their sale to individual customers.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law stipulates that the production of stamps is provided by the state-owned Mint Kremnica.</seg>
<seg id="294">The production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not subject to customs supervision in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco stickers and control tapes shall be taken from the printing works in charge of the territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, check strips for alcohol marking are further distributed to the respective local tax administrations according to the place of marking.</seg>
<seg id="297">The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control tapes.</seg>
<seg id="298">In SR there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products or part thereof, in the Czech Republic such an obligation is not introduced.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when tobacco stickers are taken from the mandated customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">By contrast, in the SR, the mark does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the audited period if used for agricultural plant primary production, so-called green diesel.</seg>
<seg id="302">As of 2017, this refund was extended to livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="303">Such support for farmers is not introduced in the SR (it existed in the 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).</seg>
<seg id="304">In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a deposit of 20 million was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. CZK (i.e. €740 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="305">The introduction of this measure reduced the number of fuel distributors from 1,891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">In SR, a similar institute of fuel distributors is introduced, but without the deposit required to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="307">303 distributors were registered in the SR in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">The Institute of Fuel Dealer and Fuel Consumer is established in the SR and is authorised by the local customs office.</seg>
<seg id="309">There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils as well as some other mineral oils are subject to marking; in the Slovak Republic, the labeling of mineral oils is not applied after the abolition of so-called red diesel oil.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code to verify the origin of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirituality of the spirit drink according to which the registration of the control tapes is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">The destruction, loss, and return of the control tape are recorded in the registry the following business day.</seg>
<seg id="313">The tape holder is obliged to notify the use of the tape within the same period.</seg>
<seg id="314">In SR, the check mark intended for labelling alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax authority and used to verify the authenticity of the stamp.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register contains the number of stamps collected, used and claimed.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and SR have introduced the Institute of compulsory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="317">In the SR, the registration shall be conditional on the fulfilment of conditions linked inter alia to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer alcohol of at least €100,000 or paid-up capital of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, obtaining registration is conditional, among other things, on the deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) for the benefit of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of registration.</seg>
<seg id="319">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="320">In the SR, in the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging, the tax administrator is required to be present on a permanent basis.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of a person obliged to mark alcohol with the condition of deposit in favour of the tax administrator from CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) according to the amount of control tapes removed and installation of tracking equipment with continuous access of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="322">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="323">The legislation of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic goes well beyond the minimum requirements of the EU for the subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as those identified in tax territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">Legislative changes adopted during the audited period allow tax administrations to prevent possible tax evasion to a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="325">Excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials has been introduced in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in addition to EU legislation to combat tax evasion in the form of abuse of tobacco raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="326">Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw materials are not harmonized tobacco products, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic monitor their movement.</seg>
<seg id="327">The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR may recommend that the measure be applied in other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits under the Excise Tax Act has proven to be effective because it reduces the risks of arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such screening also in the SR conditions.</seg>
<seg id="330">The distribution of control stamps is more efficient in the Slovak Republic than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with costs related to transport between the printer and the customer of control belts and tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="331">The financial administration of SR has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">However, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more effective in the Czech Republic, because the order of tobacco sticker itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">Thanks to the introduction of "fuel seller" and "fuel consumer" institutes, the financial administration in SR has a better overview of the locations of sales of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of compulsory labelling of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils with reduced tax rates or exempt ones.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014), a new control tape or stamp containing the identification code was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="336">The surveillance tape in the Czech Republic also contains the registration code, while in the Slovak Republic the new legislation waived its listing.</seg>
<seg id="337">Impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="338">The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol with a check mark or tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The SAO SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic may recommend the introduction of this control measure also in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-entity approach that does not block the financial resources of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">By contrast, the approach of the Czech Republic is rather restrictive because it introduces a bail-out that burdens the cash flow of tax entities, but reduces the risk of arrears.</seg>
<seg id="342">Evolution of excise revenue</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State in order to increase the revenue of the State budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to the individual and/or to the company (regulatory function of the tax).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the Communication from the Commission: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3 March 2010 under the flagship initiative A less resource-intensive Europe is the intention of the European Commission to improve the framework for market-based use of instruments, including by revising energy taxation to reduce energy consumption and resources.</seg>
<seg id="345">In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should seek to shift tax burdens from the labour force, inter alia, to energy and environmental taxation, as part of a greater "greening" of tax systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">Collection of tax revenues from excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and share of GDP is also monitored by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to query the OECD website.</seg>
<seg id="349">Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP decreased slightly according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">The exchange rate of the ECB European Central Bank was used to convert amounts in CZK to € at 31 December of the year concerned.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year on year against 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).</seg>
<seg id="353">This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Board of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting values of excise duty collection, excise duty rates and per capita income in € have decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">The significant reduction in the proportion of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off shortfall in excise revenue from tobacco products due to the impact of the new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The proportion of excise duties is also influenced by the growth in income tax collection, which has significantly increased due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="357">The excise duty on mineral oils (about 55.7% in 2015) is the biggest contributor to the overall collection of excise duties, but it has declined despite significant economic growth compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duties on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against tax fraud in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend of eco-efficient vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="360">A negligible share is the natural gas tax, the solid fuel tax and the electricity tax, which is due to a low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.</seg>
<seg id="361">If tariffs are not raised, their share will decline in the future in view of the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the reverberations of a large case of tax fraud involving the placing into circulation of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or poorly denatured alcohol in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such conduct and the revival of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the 2012 direct debits by €4 million.</seg>
<seg id="364">The proportion of tax on tobacco products has increased as a result of increasing rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">The basic rates of excise duties varied between 2012 and 2015 for the tobacco tax, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with the Council Directive on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="366">As a result of the CNB's monetary intervention, the real excise duty rate fell significantly in €, excluding the tobacco tax. It has risen only slightly in tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="367">There is no indexation of excise duty rates in relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, so the function of excise duties in regulating socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With economic growth in the Czech Republic and rising living standards, real excise duty rates are decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="369">7 Indexation - automatic adjustment of a certain economic variable by inflation, this adjustment occurs on the basis of a law or contract (for pensions paid by the State it is called indexation).</seg>
<seg id="370">Collection of excise duties linked to macroeconomic indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="371">The current legislation on excise duties in SR does not address the indexation of excise duty rates on consumer price developments because they are fixed.</seg>

<seg id="376">Of all the excise duties introduced in Slovakia, the excise duty on mineral oils has the largest share of the year-round tax revenues of the state budget, while it has not fallen below 52% throughout the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="377">The second largest share is the excise duty on tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="378">On average, this tax accounts for around 32% of the total excise duty collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012 and 2015, excise duty collection per capita of SR increased.</seg>
<seg id="380">This development is due to an increase in the rates of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="381">The increase in collection of excise duties per capita of SR is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.</seg>
<seg id="382">In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention in the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="383">The difference between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is approximately 2.7 and 2.8 times higher in the Czech Republic, but the collection for these selected products is only about 1/3 higher per person.</seg>
<seg id="384">This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the exchange rate of CZK versus € for foreign consumers.</seg>
<seg id="385">The tax on mineral oils also causes greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.</seg>
<seg id="386">In the case of tobacco products tax, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a significant impact.</seg>
<seg id="387">Evaluation The real rate of excise duties in the Czech Republic decreased as a result of CNB interventions.</seg>
<seg id="388">The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not increasing and there is no departure from labour taxation to taxation of consumption of selected excise products, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">However, the achieved values of the proportion of excise duties are consistently above the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The overall collection of excise duties is mainly influenced by the change in excise duty rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future drawdowns of excise duties due to environmental measures subsidised by the State in various forms will have to be compensated by other revenues or reductions in State expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="392">Due to the lack of indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, their regulatory functions are reduced and the EU's objectives of less dependent on environmentally inexpensive sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco are underpinned.</seg>
<seg id="393">Higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic reflects higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by lower total price of selected products in €.</seg>
<seg id="394">Administrative expenditure of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="395">The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and income related to excise tax administration, i.e. the amount of expenditure per 100 units of income (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="397">The efficiency of the tax administrator in the administration of the tax affects the scope and organisational arrangements of the tax administration, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronisation of individual activities.</seg>
<seg id="398">The calculation of the administrative costs of the tax administration using the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in the liner-controlled structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, in addition to other activities, excise duties are administered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate branch of the state and an accounting unit.</seg>
<seg id="400">In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, the customs authorities being the internal organisational unit, the costs and revenues are included collectively for the whole organisational unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">Therefore, with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of excise tax administration to the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs, expenditure and revenue of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some sub-controls are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.</seg>

<seg id="433">Administrative costs of excise tax administration in SR</seg>
<seg id="434">Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a difficult transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The formation of FŘ SR was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly formed departments of the merged customs and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="436">In connection with the administration of excise duties, activities related to the administration of excise duties within the organisational structure of FŘ SR have been integrated into a number of different sections and related trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="437">Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic Section of Customs and Tax FŘ SR Department of Excise Duties (Customs):</seg>
<seg id="438">excise separation - regulates and coordinates excise management activities; draw up expert opinions; submit proposals and comments on legislative amendments; issue a decision on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax entities; assign and delete registration sampling numbers;</seg>
<seg id="439">Department of Tax Supervision - regulates and coordinates activities in the field of tax supervision and tax control; exercise tax supervision;</seg>
<seg id="440">ELO and SPD Systems - regulates and coordinates the activities of mutual administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties, including the exchange of information through SEED and MVS; ensure management and updates in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;</seg>
<seg id="441">control stamp separation - regulates printing and stamp handling activities; carry out tax supervision of the disposition and disposal of printing sheets and stamps in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="442">Department of the Vice President of Financial Administration</seg>
<seg id="443">Department of Excise and Customs Remedies (Customs):</seg>
<seg id="444">excise remedies - review the decisions of the customs authorities on the basis of the ordinary and extraordinary remedies applied; the appeal procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="445">The Customs Section was established during 2012; each customs office (9 customs offices), which has territorial responsibilities determined by the higher territorial units, has been directly incorporated under it, with the exception of one customs office which has been established, inter alia, to carry out tasks in connection with the external border of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">separation of excise duties - carrying out methodological activities in relation to branches of customs offices and customs stations; for selected entities, the tax administrator performs direct acts, namely the registration (tax warehouse, authorised recipient repurposed, registered consignor), the amount of collateral, determination and refund, tax supervision and tax control; decides to waive the composition of the security; decides to waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee in the tax warehouse for alcohol;</seg>
<seg id="448">separation of laws - decision-making activities in respect of infringements of tax legislation; activities related to sound and exceptional remedies; tax enforcement proceedings;</seg>
<seg id="449">Branch Office - decides on registration (except tax warehouse, authorised recipient for re-admission, registered consignor), amount of collateral; prescribe and refund the tax; exercise tax supervision and tax control; decide on security and on the forfeiture of goods;</seg>
<seg id="450">customs office station - exercise of tax supervision over the holding and movement of excise goods; ensure the exercise of permanent tax supervision in the alcohol tax warehouse; decide on security and on the forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">Expenditure of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic on the administration of excise duties is constantly increasing, as investments in efficient tax administration and electronisation of financial administration increase with the exception of wage growth.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although excise revenues have increased, IT adjustments related to UNITAS have increased more rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="453">Wage expenditure is significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses for alcohol, which is not applied by the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">The expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the administration of excise duties increased significantly in 2015 between 2012 and 2015, mainly due to the increase in wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, excise revenue grew at about the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the wider competences of the customs administration, e.g. weighing trucks, controlling the fulfilment of obligations in connection with myth.</seg>
<seg id="457">The efficiency of administrative costs in the SR shows a slightly deteriorating trend year on year.</seg>
<seg id="458">The number of employees did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee increased.</seg>
<seg id="459">The number of employees in the Czech Republic did not change significantly, but expenditure per employee compared to the Slovak Republic grew more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="460">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor in the impaired efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be assessed as a natural development.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, maintaining considerable administrative burdens in the management of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, as confirmed by the non-decreasing number of employees in excise tax management.</seg>
<seg id="463">However, in the Slovak Republic, the administration of excise duties with lower revenues is significantly more demanding on personnel capacities.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators for excise duty management</seg>
<seg id="465">Excise duty management is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration for business, traffic supervision, control and search of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The numbers of administrative operations and managed entities are indicators of the performance of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="468">The correlation between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrations expresses the efficiency of the tax administration's activities and defines the cost of the specific activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">Authorisations and marketing authorisations are essential for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrator is obliged to carry out continuous administration for entities authorised or registered with a focus on the supervision of compliance with the laws and conditions laid down by the tax administrator, to which adequate personnel resources must be allocated.</seg>
<seg id="471">The reference indicator was the number of valid authorisations or registrations to operate at 31 December of each year.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of authorisations or registrations issued is not identical to the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the case.</seg>
<seg id="474">The administrative activities monitored are the most significant acts of the tax administration (claims of tax, administration of transport in the EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of actions concluded by a report or decision.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="476">Authorisation and registration to operate in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">It is possible to manufacture, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the permission of the tax administration to operate a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="479">If the tax warehouse operator has multiple warehouses, a permit shall be issued for each individually, including tax collateral.</seg>
<seg id="480">Tax protection is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administration (i.e. the physical presence of an official and the provision of equipment by the tax administrator's conclusions).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">The tax warehouse operator also registers for tax pursuant to Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">The authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products conditionally exempted from the import point to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to an export point in another Member State or to a recipient in another Member State (replaces the status of registered consignor pursuant to Art. Article 4 (2) 10 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels without tax, which are analogies of tax warehouse permits.</seg>
<seg id="485">The brewer produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (14,300 CZK/hl ethanol) - fruit distillates for growers. It is not a tax warehouse and the operating permit is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">The reduced rate of tax may be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of the grower intended for personal consumption for the production period (July-June).</seg>
<seg id="487">The registration of the cultivation burning held by the operators of the batch and made available by the tax authorities shall include information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">The eligible recipient for the re-admission of the selected products and the authorised recipient for the one-off acceptance of the selected products shall be entitled, under the authorisation of the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to accept or repeat the selected products under a conditional system transported from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="490">The user of selected exempt products is a legal or natural person who receives and uses, or according to Section 52a or Section 53 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll. sells to another user selected exempt products; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">Exempt products may be accepted and used only on the basis of a final authorisation, and only from the supplier specified in the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Under the authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of a use permit or user authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">Mineral oils exempt from tax may be sold without authorisation in statutory cases such as:</seg>
<seg id="494">waste oils of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if produced or produced by the user in its operation;</seg>
<seg id="495">selected mineral oils exempt from tax in unit packs of not more than 20 litres intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production and at the same time intended for sale to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="496">Exempt products may be transported with a proof of exemption.</seg>
<seg id="497">The distributor of alcohol in the consumer package is entitled to sell or otherwise transfer the alcohol put into free circulation after compulsory registration with the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="498">The storekeeper of raw tobacco is entitled to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="499">The person handling the special mineral oils is entitled to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils, which are in bulk or placed in packs exceeding 220 litres, on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down.</seg>
<seg id="500">The fuel distributor is entitled to sell fuel on the territory of the Czech Republic on the basis of the issued concession and registration of the tax administration under the specified conditions, except for the sale of fuel from the service station.</seg>
<seg id="501">The transport of the PHM must be accompanied by a tax document, a sales document or a transport document, or a distribution plan and rollovers.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent before the start of transport to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="503">The petrol station operator owns the fuel sold at the service station.</seg>
<seg id="504">Petrol stations are places where the sale or supply of PHM to a fuel tank is permitted under the permission of the building authority.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators broken down into: registered - normal sale or supply of PHM usually to fuel tanks of vehicles; with a defined approach - operating generally in different company premises (e.g. quarries, saws, agricultural farms, transport organisations, construction yards), the sale is made for the other party on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel dispensing points for the own consumption of operators only.</seg>
<seg id="506">A service station is not a construction or equipment in the form of an operating tank located in operation (e.g. on a chassis) if the fuel is issued only for own use.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to the authorisation of the tax administration and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons may purchase, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free circulation for resale under the permission of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="509">They shall be authorised even if they purchase or obtain liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative operations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">Tax control is a set of actions. The subject of the tax control is the tax liability, the claim of the tax entity or other circumstances applicable to the correct detection and determination of the tax relating to one tax proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="512">Tax control can be carried out jointly for multiple tax procedures of one tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">A repeated tax check may be carried out only under the conditions and justification laid down by law when the check is initiated.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tax control is carried out within a period of three years for the determination of the tax, the period being extended by one year under statutory conditions (e.g. submission of additional tax proceedings, initiation of criminal proceedings in connection with the tax in question) or is suspended (judicial proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">The period for determining the tax ends no later than 10 years after the expiry of the deadline for submitting an ordinary tax claim.</seg>
<seg id="516">The tax administrator is not required to carry out a tax check on each tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">The start of the tax check sets the deadlines for filing additional tax returns or additional accounts by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts the deadline for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">On the basis of its result, an official tax may be determined.</seg>
<seg id="519">The local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administrator seeks evidence and examines premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging for tax entities and other persons involved in the administration of taxes, on the spot outside the tax administration's premises (e.g. at the sales point, on the road).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and items, take samples or arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="521">On the basis of the result of the local investigation, the tax cannot be assessed separately, but the tax entity may be invited to submit an additional tax return (Section 145 para. 2 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="522">Checking traffic data in the EMCS is not a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="523">Only the registered person obliged to mark the alcohol may place the order of alcohol labelling belts at the local marking point and is carried out using intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the alcohol labelling register application.</seg>
<seg id="524">The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered quantity of control tapes and orders production.</seg>
<seg id="525">They do not oversee the production of control belts.</seg>
<seg id="526">The production is provided by the State Price Printing Company, a state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="527">The control tape customer receives the control tapes from the tax administrator of the locally applicable marking point.</seg>
<seg id="528">The order of tobacco labels for cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars and tobacco for smoking is a tax return.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco sticker corresponds to the amount of the tax liability and the purchaser of the tobacco stickers is obliged to pay their value within 60 days of their removal from the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="530">The customer is obliged to calculate in the order itself the value corresponding to the amount of tax obligation ordered tobacco stickers.</seg>
<seg id="531">This period applies only if the value of tobacco stickers is secured.</seg>
<seg id="532">The order of tobacco stickers is made on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance in writing or via a data box with the possibility of using smart forms.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco stickers is ensured by the State Price Printer, a state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorised tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemia Region (Kutná Hora Territorial Office), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, who further distributes them and further checks their transport, storage and use with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="535">Tax claims include regular tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including tobacco sticker orders, filed by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">The declaration of tax under the customs procedure on the basis of customs declarations and the declaration of the claim for refund of tax on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of business other than for the production of heat or engine propulsion, mineral oils used for agricultural primary production are not included.</seg>
<seg id="537">The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with infringements detected, which are a set of successive administrative acts. The International Exchange of Information on Tax Entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 shall take the form of: a request for administrative cooperation, replies to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, event reports, inspection reports.</seg>
<seg id="538">Transport under suspension between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax administrator of the receiving or dispatching tax warehouse or authorised beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in SR</seg>
<seg id="540">Authorisation and registration to operate in SR</seg>
<seg id="541">The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is provided primarily by the customs offices and the Excise Department of the Customs and Tax Section of FŘ SR, whose procedures for the administration of excise duties are governed by individual laws on excise taxes and the tax code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws determine not only the scope of authorisations for the CA and FŘ SR in the administration of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with the registration or payment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="543">The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, due to an increase in tax warehouse permits issued, an increase in the registration of the authorised recipient for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="544">The legislation has clarified the transport of certain bulk mineral oils as well as the notification obligation, if transported freely or in packaging of more than 150 litres, or 230 litres, as well as an extension of the list of mineral oils subject to control and transport procedure, other goods, e.g. anti-tapping products, oxidative inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, products to improve viscosity, anti-corrosive products.</seg>
<seg id="545">A mandatory indication concerning the indication of their kinematic viscosity has been introduced for lubricating oils.</seg>
<seg id="546">An approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in SR is provided in the following sections of the document.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse operator</seg>
<seg id="548">Within the national legislation of SR, when registering the tax warehouse operator in the context of all excise duties, the person wishing to operate the tax warehouse must also apply simultaneously for the registration and issuing of permits for the operation of the tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration process is the excise registration certificate, by which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the CA grants permission to operate a tax warehouse, which entitles the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="551">If the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax administrator will issue a separate permit for each tax warehouse to operate the tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The transport of an excise subject under suspension is monitored electronically via the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">A unique reference code is generated for each transport.</seg>
<seg id="554">ARC code under which the said transport can be monitored online and therefore in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">Where the tax warehouse operator is also a person authorised to distribute alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the commercial name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer package which he places in free circulation, at the latest on the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered sender</seg>
<seg id="557">The registered consignor is a special type of tax entity which cannot be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if it dispatches the excise duty subject under suspension after release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="558">Under the national legislation of the SR, when registering a registered consignor under all excise duties, a person wishing to dispatch an excise duty subject under the suspension procedure after release for free circulation for the customs procedure must simultaneously apply to the CA for registration and issuing an authorisation to send the excise duty subject under that procedure.</seg>
<seg id="559">The CA shall issue a certificate of registration for the excise duty concerned and at the same time issue an authorisation to dispatch the excise duty subject under the suspension procedure after its release for free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="560">Growing brandy</seg>
<seg id="561">The basic operation for the operation of the cultivated brandy is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in the distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development SR.</seg>
<seg id="562">However, the authorization itself from the Ministry does not entitle the holder of the permit to operate the cultivated brandy.</seg>
<seg id="563">In order for a person to operate a cultivated brandy, he must submit an application to the CA for registration and certification of registration of the producer.</seg>
<seg id="564">The CA shall issue a certificate of registration for the excise duty in question, which at the same time entitles the producer of the brandy to produce the alcohol in the growing fuel.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of the growing fuel is to provide services to growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">Cultivation brandy cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">The legislator allows for a reduced tax rate of 50% of the basic tax rate, i.e. €540/hl, to be applied to alcohol produced in the breeder's brandy.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced rate of taxation shall apply to alcohol produced in the growing fuel in quantities not exceeding 43 l and. one grower and his household per production period in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period runs from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">The production period is not the same as the calendar year and it is therefore possible to apply a reduced rate of tax to the alcohol produced more than once within one calendar year because the alcohol is produced in two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">This involves the production of alcohol outside the suspension scheme, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The breeder shall pay not only the excise duty and value added tax for the alcohol produced, but also the price for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The breeder's brandy shall issue to the farmer a removal certificate which serves not only as proof of origin and method of acquisition of the alcohol but also as proof of payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The transport of alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of consumer packaging</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who intend to import consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third State and put it into free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CA for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="577">The importer of consumer packaging shall not register for the relevant excise duty, but the CA shall issue a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.</seg>
<seg id="578">That certificate entitles the importer to import consumer packaging of alcohol or consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before issuing the stamps, they must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the amount of alcohol or cigarettes they wish to put into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of consumer packaging must put into free circulation only consumer packaging marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="581">They must therefore submit to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the control stamps exported to the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="582">On importation, the importer is required to certify by the customs office of import the number of stamps imported back from the territory of a third State.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaging, the importer shall proceed within the meaning of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">In the event of the release of consumer packaging into free circulation, the tax guarantee lodged shall be repaid to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">The importer of consumer packaging is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">Where the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol is also a person authorised to distribute alcohol, he shall notify the CA electronically of the commercial name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and the EAN barcode for each new type of consumer package which he places in free circulation, at the latest on the date of its introduction.</seg>
<seg id="587">Retailer of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free circulation and eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for the retailer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person wishing to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CA for a permit and comply with the statutory conditions (trade authorisation for commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; she has not been withdrawn from the sales permit for 10 years; is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As this is a consumer package of alcohol in free circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="591">For example, an invoice containing also the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="592">The holder of the authorisation shall keep for each establishment, for a calendar month, a record of the number of consumer packages of alcohol accepted, the number of consumer packages of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol on the last day of the month and the registration of shortages or surpluses in the number of consumer packages of alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="593">The holder of the authorisation shall only purchase or otherwise withdraw alcohol in consumer packaging from the person authorised to distribute in the course of the business.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of consumer alcohol packaging</seg>
<seg id="595">In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free circulation and eliminate tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute distributor of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person who intends to hold a distribution permit must apply to the CA for a distribution authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant must comply with the legal conditions (trade licence for commercial trade; storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer alcohol of at least €100,000 or paid-up capital of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees; has no arrears towards the customs office; has no arrears on compulsory levies; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; he has not been withdrawn from the sales permit for 10 years; is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As this is a consumer package of alcohol in free circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="599">For example, an invoice containing also the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="600">For each establishment, the holder of the distribution authorisation shall keep a register for each calendar month of the number of consumer packages of alcohol accepted, the number of consumer packages of alcohol issued, the stocks of alcohol in consumer packaging on the last day of the month and the registration of shortages or surpluses in the number of consumer packages of alcohol received and issued.</seg>
<seg id="601">The holder of the distribution authorisation shall only purchase alcohol in the consumer package from another person authorised to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="602">The person authorised to distribute shall notify the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Fuel dealer</seg>
<seg id="604">Due to the monitoring of fuels in free tax circulation as well as the elimination of tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely the fuel seller.</seg>
<seg id="605">There is no specific regulation governing service stations in the territory of SR.</seg>
<seg id="606">Therefore, the petrol stations in the SR national legislation are incorporated as fuel sellers.</seg>
<seg id="607">Person wishing to sell petrol in free circulation in the course of business activities in the tax territory, diesel or LPG for final consumption, is obliged to apply to the CA for an authorisation to sell before the sale begins and to provide proof of proof, that the storage facility is certified and equipped with an appropriate validated measuring device to measure the amount of mineral oil at intake and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the propellant seller is a tax warehouse operator, authorised consignee or registered consignor, the CA shall also automatically issue an authorisation for the sale of propellants to registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="609">The fuel dealer is obliged to keep records of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for a calendar month, among other legal obligations, and is also obliged to notify the CA of the new fuel supplier (distributor).</seg>
<seg id="610">The fuel dealer is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise remove propellants only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="611">As these are fuels in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, when delivering propellants through the autocistern, the distributor prints the so-called bottles from the measuring equipment built into the autocistern.</seg>
<seg id="613">That document shall include, in addition to the information relating to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">For example, an invoice containing the fuel distributor number allocated by the tax authority is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of propellants.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tax administrator in the territory of SR records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="616">This is primarily an attempt to avoid roadside checks during transport, which is why hauliers use secondary road roads, bypassing the toll selection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual traffic.</seg>
<seg id="617">Transports of mineral oils in converted tanks with double bottom are also carried out.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many times, illegal traffic is accompanied by a vehicle that reports possible mobile patrols to the carrier in order to change the route and avoid road control.</seg>
<seg id="619">There is also mixing of propellants with light heating oils or waste oils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Fuel distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">Due to the monitoring of fuels in free tax circulation, as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely the fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the tax territory in the course of a business activity in free circulation of petrol, diesel or LPG shall, before the start of distribution, apply to the customs office for a distribution permit and provide proof that the storage facility is certified and equipped with appropriate verified measuring equipment, as well as a list of suppliers and customers</seg>
<seg id="623">The fuel distributor is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep separate records of the purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for each establishment per calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="624">The fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise remove propellants only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="625">The fuel distributor may only sell to a fuel distributor, registered person or fuel consumer in the tax territory.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, when delivering propellants via the autocistern, the distributor prints, when pumping fuel, the fuel dealers and the fuel consumers respectively, the so-called bottles from the measuring equipment built into the autocistern.</seg>
<seg id="627">That document shall include, in addition to the information relating to the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As these are fuels in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="629">For example, an invoice containing the number of the distributor of propellants or registered persons allocated by the tax administrator is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of propellants.</seg>
<seg id="630">Fuel consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">The consumer of fuel has a special position in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases petrol, diesel or LPG in the tax territory in free circulation for his own consumption and stores such mineral oil in a storage facility of 15 000 litres or more shall notify the customs office of that fact at the latest before first being placed in storage.</seg>
<seg id="633">Consumers of fuel shall be registered by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to the legal facts, he is obliged to indicate the location of the storage facility.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, they are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">Storage equipment shall be verified and fitted with a measuring device enabling the quantity of propellants to be measured at the time of receipt and dispensing (static mark, measurement bar).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank shall comply with technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">The fuel consumer must only purchase propellants from a fuel distributor or a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As they are fuels in free tax circulation, an accompanying document is not required for transport.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, when delivering the propellants via the autocistern, the distributor prints the so-called bottles from the measuring equipment incorporated in the autocistern when pumping the propellants to the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="641">That document shall also include the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate, in addition to the quantity data.</seg>
<seg id="642">For example, an invoice containing the fuel distributor number allocated by the tax authority is sufficient to demonstrate the method of acquisition of propellants.</seg>
<seg id="643">The tax administrator in the territory of SR records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer within the business and meets the legal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">If the conditions laid down by law are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced tax rate, i.e. €2,652 per hl/percent of the volume of the actual alcoholic strength.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to up to 200 000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">Since beer is produced outside the suspension scheme, an accompanying document is not required for transport as it is in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, they are small family businesses that also operate restaurants or bars in which they offer beer of their own production for sale.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative operations in the SR</seg>
<seg id="652">This subheading approximates the exercise of excise tax administration tax supervision for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in SR.</seg>
<seg id="653">The largest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, which was due to the realisation of more transfers in the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="654">By contrast, the largest decrease was recorded in 2014, up to 4.3%, due to fewer tax checks completed and fewer tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="655">The decrease concerned legislative changes.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax checks</seg>
<seg id="657">By exercising tax control, the CA detects or verifies the facts determining the correct determination of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="658">Employees of the CA shall be shown the tax inspection mandate, which includes, inter alia, the purpose and object of the audit and the extent of the tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited tax period may be one month, but also more tax periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The scope of the controlled tax periods is determined by the CA.</seg>
<seg id="661">The tax check begins with the registration of the commencement of the tax check.</seg>
<seg id="662">The CA will confirm the receipt of the documents.</seg>
<seg id="663">The CA is obliged to return the leased documents within 30 days from the end of the tax check.</seg>
<seg id="664">The CA employee shall draw up a protocol from tax control.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax check identifies a difference in the sum to be paid, declared or claimed by the audited tax entity, the CA, together with the Protocol to the audited tax entity, shall also send an invitation to comment on the findings set out in the Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax check is terminated on the date of receipt of the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="667">The period for carrying out the tax check shall be no more than one year from the date of its initiation.</seg>
<seg id="668">The tax check for registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once until the date of termination of the right to tax, which is 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="669">FŘ SR issued an internal management act adjusting the above mentioned deadlines due to the single tax administration procedure in the territory of SR.</seg>
<seg id="670">Local investigations</seg>
<seg id="671">A local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator in which it searches for evidence, examines and identifies the facts that are needed for the purposes of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">The CA employee records the local investigation and submits the copy to the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="673">In carrying out the local investigation, the CA employee has the right to unrestricted access to land, operating buildings, rooms and places, including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">The clearing of the quantities of alcohol produced shall be established in the form of a local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="675">The facts established are the basis for the exercise of tax control.</seg>
<seg id="676">In the course of the local investigation, the CA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the matter.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FR SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and local investigations for individual excise duties subjects in order to harmonise the procedures of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="678">Permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses for alcohol</seg>
<seg id="679">With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1.5.2004, there was also a change in excise tax management.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more efficient spending of the state budget in administering alcohol excise duty, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative instruments to more effectively suppress the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in 2004 in connection with the administration of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the field of excise administration from the tax offices to the customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for a tax administrator in the tax warehouse to alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In the territory of SR, national legislation determines that it is only possible to receive, issue, produce or process alcohol in the tax warehouse in the presence of a CA employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or dispatches alcohol only in the consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="684">At the same time, the CA is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse so that the income, supply, production or processing of alcohol is not restricted.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse operator is obliged to ensure the conditions of the working environment for CA employees.</seg>
<seg id="686">Based on the contract concluded with FŘ SR, the CA pays the rental costs to the tax warehouse operator on a monthly basis.</seg>
<seg id="687">In the tax warehouse for the production, processing or storage of alcohol, the production facility for the storage of alcohol shall be so adapted as to enable the quantity of alcohol produced, the alcohol processed, the alcohol stored, including the alcohol and alcohol contained therein to be ascertained at any time.</seg>
<seg id="688">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="689">Where alcohol is not accepted, dispensed, produced or processed in a tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to ensure the presence of a customs office employee, which it is obliged to secure by closing the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">However, this option is not used very often in practice because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs employee to their advantage.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse operators use the legal option within the meaning of Act No 467/2002 Z. z., on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use the production facility for the production of alcohol at the distillery for the cultivation and also for the purpose of the distillery for distillates, which must be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Approximately 250 customs officers ensure the exercise of permanent tax supervision in alcohol storage.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issue of vouchers for the collection of alcohol control stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">The basic act for the collection of the stamps shall be to send a request to the customs office for the assignment of the registration sampling number and to issue a voucher for the collection of the check stamps for alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="695">Alcoholic beverage, which is alcohol, means goods of Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1,2% by volume.</seg>
<seg id="696">The check mark is intended for labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaging of alcohol shall be considered to be closed consumer packaging filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaging of the Combined Nomenclature codes 2207 and 2208 may be placed in free circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee and the importer of the consumer packaging, which will put it into free tax circulation, may mark consumer packaging with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="700">The check stamp contains, inter alia, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numeric character. The identification number shall include the registration sampling number (1-6 instead of the numerical character), the volume of alcohol (7-11 instead of the numerical character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer package (12-14 instead of the numerical character).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original model of check mark for alcohol:</seg>
<seg id="702">The registration number shall be assigned separately by the CA to each customer.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only a check mark, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of the consumer's packaging, the volume concentration of the alcohol in the consumer's packaging and the customer's control mark, may be used to indicate the consumer's packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new information system for stamps.</seg>
<seg id="705">The aim of the new control stamp information system was to simplify and computerise the system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution and use of labelling stamps for consumer alcohol packaging.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee, the importer of the consumer packaging and the consignee (s) of the alcohol may refer to the consumer's packaging.</seg>
<seg id="707">The purchaser of the stamps wishing to withdraw the stamps under the "new system" must request the customs office to issue the stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Through the electronic system, the customer of the control stamps is obliged to request their issue, notify the data resulting from the national legislation of SR and keep the registration of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="709">The number of control stamp items ordered shall not be less than or equal to 500 units.</seg>
<seg id="710">The tax administrator also communicates with the customers of the stamps by means of an electronic system of stamps, in particular when notifying the number of stamps that the customer of the stamps may withdraw, or when determining the date of receipt of the stamps by the customer of the stamps at the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="711">The customer of the control stamps is obliged to deposit on the account of the tax administrator the funds corresponding to the price of the control stamps which he may withdraw and the quantity of which shall be notified to him by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the check stamp takes into account the amount of refunds to the printer. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">The control stamps are entitled to print the state-owned company Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="714">FŘ SR exercises tax supervision over the handling of control stamps and their liquidation in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="715">FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when handling control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="716">FŘ SR ensures the sale of control stamps to the customer of control stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="717">Check stamps can only be withdrawn in the printing works from an employee of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issuing of vouchers for the collection of stamps for tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="719">The customer of the check stamp must ask the CA to assign a registration sampling number and issue a voucher for the purchase of the check stamp.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packaging of cigarettes may be put into free circulation only if it is marked with a check mark.</seg>
<seg id="721">It is only possible to mark consumer cigarette packaging with a stamp in a company that manufactures cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">Only the tax warehouse operator, the authorised consignee or the importer of tobacco products wishing to place tobacco products in free circulation in the tax territory may be the purchaser of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="723">For the labelling of consumer packages of cigarettes, only a check mark corresponding to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes packed, the length of cigarettes, the validity of the tax rate and the registration sampling number may be used.</seg>
<seg id="724">Consumer cigarette packaging can only be sold for final consumption at the price indicated on the stamp.</seg>
<seg id="725">At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new information system for stamps.</seg>
<seg id="726">The new control stamp information system was aimed at simplifying and informatising the system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using stamps intended for labelling consumer packages of tobacco, cigars, cigaretarillos and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">The purchaser of the stamps wishing to withdraw the stamps under the "new system" must request the customs office to issue the stamps electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Through the electronic system, the customer of the control stamps is obliged to request their issue, notify the data resulting from the national legislation of SR and keep the registration of the control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="729">The control stamps are entitled to print the state-owned company Mincovna Kremnice.</seg>
<seg id="730">FŘ SR exercises tax supervision over the handling of control stamps and their liquidation in the printing works.</seg>
<seg id="731">FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when handling control stamps.</seg>
<seg id="732">FŘ SR ensures the sale of control stamps to the customer of control stamps in the printer.</seg>
<seg id="733">Check stamps can only be withdrawn in the printing works from an employee of the Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="734">The operator of the tax warehouse or the importer of tobacco products may mark the consumer packaging of tobacco with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="735">The operator of the tax warehouse, the importer of tobacco products or the authorised consignee may mark the consumer packaging of cigars or cigarillos with a stamp.</seg>
<seg id="736">The labelling of consumer packages of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos shall be used only by means of a check stamp bearing the indication for the validity of the excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="737">It is only possible to mark consumer cigarette packaging with a stamp in the company that produced them.</seg>
<seg id="738">The number of control stamp items ordered shall not be less than or equal to 500 units.</seg>
<seg id="739">The CA shall electronically notify the customer of the control stamps within three working days at the latest of the number of control stamps which he may withdraw, the price of the control stamps and the account number of FŘ SR.</seg>
<seg id="740">The CA may reduce the number of items of control stamps ordered if circumstances arise on the basis of which it can reasonably be assumed that there may be a breach of tax legislation.</seg>
<seg id="741">FŘ SR will determine the date of receipt of the stamps by the customer of the stamps, but not later than 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="742">By means of an electronic stamp system, FŘ SR shall notify the customer of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="743">Control marks shall be issued exclusively by the Financial Directorate in the printing works, but only after receipt of the funds corresponding to their price in the relevant account indicated in the electronic notification by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="744">The customer of the stamps is obliged to keep the registration of the stamps in the electronic stamp system separately for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="745">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)</seg>
<seg id="746">Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and SPD systems department of the Excise Tax Department of FŘ SR is responsible for ensuring the exchange of information following a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent financial administration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="747">These include in particular requests for screening of excise authorities, requests for information on excise duty management and requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">The exchange of applications shall take place in electronic form within the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following actions are included in administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (request for screening, request for information on excise duty management, application for confirmation of registration in the SEED); response to the request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; an event report; inspection report.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In the Slovak Republic, tax warehouses are subject to permanent tax supervision. In the Czech Republic, this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision by a monitoring device.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are a tax warehouse, in SR they are only registered by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Institute of Registered Consignor is established in SR, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="756">In the SR, 43 l may be fired at a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in the case of cultivation burning.</seg>
<seg id="757">By contrast, in the Czech Republic, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can be applied only for 30 l and.</seg>
<seg id="758">The cultivated brandy in SR must be authorised not only by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development SR, but also by the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture authorizes the cultivation of branches.</seg>
<seg id="760">In the SR, the import of consumer packaging of alcohol is carried out in addition to the tax warehouse operator by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">The authorisation of the importer shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, no special authorisation from the tax administrator is required to import consumer packaging of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="763">In SR, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is conditional on the issuing of a tax administration permit for the seller.</seg>
<seg id="764">The retailer of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records, inter alia, of the purchase and sale.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any authorization for the final seller of consumer packaging of alcohol; the final seller does not keep any special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In SR, the fuel dealer must be authorised by the tax administrator to sell them.</seg>
<seg id="767">The national legislation in SR does not regulate any special regulation of the petrol station, all activities concerning petrol stations are regulated only in the Act on excise duty on mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the petrol station is regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administration does not issue any permit to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="769">Petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="770">In SR, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In the SR there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative operations</seg>
<seg id="775">In the SR, substantive legislation provides for the exercise of tax control by selected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is specified in an internal management act issued by FŘ SR due to the application of the uniform procedure of tax administrations in the territory of SR.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, the substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to carry out tax checks, the procedural law only provides for the possibility of carrying out checks no later than the deadline for charging the tax.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and local investigations carried out in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of FŘ SR determines in which cases and in what time the tax administration must carry out a tax check, whereas in the Czech Republic the correctness of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by local investigations.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to an increase in the number of transfers in the EMCS system and also due to an increase in the number of tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In the SR, the number of administrative operations between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by an increasing number of transactions in the EMCS system and a decrease in the number of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="781">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="782">The large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities showed different legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative acts of the tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in the individual years of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="784">In SR, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds of the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same amount of administrative transactions.</seg>
<seg id="785">It can be noted from the above that SR is more focused on the implementation of administrative acts by tax administrations, e.g. the exercise of physical tax supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote surveillance, e.g. tracking devices, immediate sending of data via web interface and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Electronisation of administrative operations</seg>
<seg id="788">Electronization of administrative operations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">Tax returns can be filed through the data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced interactive forms of tax returns, which can no longer be processed automated.</seg>
<seg id="791">The data must also be transcribed into the personal tax account of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit is to limit the error rate of filed tax returns (DAPs), which saves the tax administrator's actions related to the correction procedure erroneously filed by DAPs.</seg>
<seg id="793">GŘC is working on a new application for electronic DAP processing.</seg>
<seg id="794">In addition, through intelligent forms, it is possible to submit tax applications or business registration and notification of data changes, to apply refund claims, to comply with reporting obligations on the handling of specific mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">The handling of control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the information system ORO WebClient, which is available for registered entities for registration by the tax administrator of the specified data.</seg>
<seg id="796">Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under suspension of tax must be carried out in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Transport of selected products in free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with proof of their taxation, proof of excise duty exemption, decision of the customs office to release the selected products under customs procedure, simplified accompanying document or other decision on excise duty assessment.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is laid down by law.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">It allows the documentary form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents, which are sent via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to the data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).</seg>
<seg id="801">The JIK shall serve for the purposes of inspection by the customs authorities on the way and shall prevent repeated transport to the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">For the largest fuel warehouse operator in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, CS CR has online access to an electronic registration system in which the entity automatically deposits the issued tax documents.</seg>
<seg id="803">CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for the registration and monitoring of selected products in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should use 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.</seg>
<seg id="805">The advantage will be the user-known environment for declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to a system of global guarantees, a register of tax entities or a system of risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should allow for an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which is still operating on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">The risks of the current procedure for registering selected products in free circulation can be seen primarily in the abuse of a simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.</seg>
<seg id="809">Electronisation of administrative operations in SR</seg>
<seg id="810">When administering excise duties, the Financial Administration of the SR uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in the EMCS system under suspension of tax exemptions, control stamps, filing of tax returns and also when registering and registering tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">One-way electronic communication of tax entities with the tax administrator was also introduced in 2014, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="812">In the framework of electronic communication, the tax entity has a personal Internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration after entering the access data.</seg>
<seg id="813">Within this zone, the tax entity has access to an electronic filing office through which it submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other excise tax administration documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">However, electronic communication through the personal Internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate electronically with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="816">They are mainly taxpayers of value added tax, tax advisers representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="817">The SAO also addressed the question of the scope of electronisation of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="818">These were only fully electronic transactions, namely tax returns and electronic communications within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">If one looks away from the EMCS, the electronisation of selected comparable administrative tasks has increased, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">A fully electronised processing of the tax return is already in place in the SR from its filing to the registration of the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic the electronic processing of tax returns is not set.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, it is possible for tax entities to insert compulsory documents for individual transport in free tax circulation on the website.</seg>
<seg id="825">In the future, the announcement of transport in free tax circulation is being prepared in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="826">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="827">The system of reporting of transactions in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax surveillance, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as a good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="830">Due to good practice in the area of electronization of tax returns, the SAO SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic recommend that the electronization of tax returns be completed in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes in organisational structure and staffing in excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic have undergone major changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="834">The customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 consists of the Directorate-General of Customs and customs offices, which are the administrative offices and organisational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="835">GŘC is an entity for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive excise tax administration since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.</seg>
<seg id="837">CS CR also performs:</seg>
<seg id="838">a) check:</seg>
<seg id="839">in the field of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of road usage charges, fulfilment of the conditions for the transport of dangerous cargo, professional supervision of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and international passenger transport),</seg>
<seg id="840">the management of waste and packaging material,</seg>
<seg id="841">the safety of imported food;</seg>
<seg id="842">in the field of consumer protection and intellectual property rights,</seg>
<seg id="843">employing foreigners,</seg>
<seg id="844">b) customs administration - it is a comprehensive application of customs legislation, trade policy measures and formalities for the import and export of goods,</seg>
<seg id="845">c) the collection and recovery of monetary transactions imposed by other public authorities within the framework of the divided administration;</seg>
<seg id="846">d) the activities of the police authority (mandated by the customs authorities) in proceedings concerning offences committed by violation of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the scope of competencies (concurrency of control activities) increases the total cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are cost savings from the scale, as the public administration does not have to spend expenses on the status of control group for each subject of control separately.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden of re-checking is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="849">10 From 1. 12. 2016, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic also exercises the competence to verify the performance of obligations in the registration of sales (§ 2 para. 2 of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the registration of sales) and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the Act and the conditions of the operation of gambling including the imposition of penalties (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on gambling).</seg>
<seg id="850">Within the framework of the project Modernisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tiered structure to two-tiered one with effect from 1 January 2013, and the middle article of the procedure (customs directorates) was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="851">GŘC spent approximately 51 million on the project. CZK (i.e. approx. € 2,031,000).</seg>
<seg id="852">CS CR from 1. 1. 2013 consists of the GØC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational units of the state.</seg>
<seg id="853">Customs offices and their competence are provided for by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="854">Territorial workplaces are internal organisational units of customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">The Ministry of Finance is entitled to set up and abolish territorial workplaces and determine their substantive scope by decree.</seg>
<seg id="856">The legislation does not provide for any competence for territorial workplaces; the territorial posts shall exercise the competence of the customs office on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure in the 31.12.2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure from 1.1.2013</seg>
<seg id="859">The administration of excise duties until 31 December 2012 was carried out by the DGC, eight CDs and 58 departments of the CA (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 trade unions and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">As of 1 January 2016, the excise duties were administered by the DG and 51 departments at the CA and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight departments of the legal department of the DC and the departments of the CA providing mobile surveillance, i.e. about 60 posts.</seg>
<seg id="861">The cost of the CS CR most significantly affects wage expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="862">As a result of the reorganisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings of personnel resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the Act on the Service of Members of the Security Corps.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility to reduce the number of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to the provisions of § 42 para. 1 of Act No. 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the Security Corps, can only be discharged from the service in cases which are strictly defined.</seg>
<seg id="865">Reduction of posts as a result of organisational changes in the Security Corps is not the reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure the assignment of members of the appropriate service posts within the Corps, or to secure posts with another Security Corps (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Services of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will reassign them to the reserve for the temporarily unincorporated, in which members of the Security Corps belong according to the law 80% of the average service income.</seg>
<seg id="866">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="867">Organization of excise tax administration in SR</seg>
<seg id="868">The Government of the Slovak Republic has set itself as one of the priorities of completing tax administration reform through the UNITAS programme, which ensures additional budgetary resources by unifying tax collection, tariffs and levies and by suppressing tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, which resulted in the merger of the SR Tax Directorate and the SR Customs Directorate into the SR Financial Directorate and the creation of a financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">FŘ SR was established for 1.1.2012 by Act No 333/2011 Z. z., on government authorities in the area of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation which is located in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="871">FŘ SR, CA and Criminal Office of Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No. 199/2004 Z. z., the Customs Act and the amendment and supplementation of certain Acts, as amended, are customs authorities if they carry out duties under customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="872">Within the meaning of Law No 333/2011 Z. z., on government authorities in the area of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities, constitute the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="873">The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of SR, the Criminal Office of Financial Administration, the Competent Centre of Financial Operations, Tax Offices, Tax Office for Selected Tax Entities, Branches of Tax Offices, Contact Points of Tax Offices, Customs Offices, Customs Branch Branch</seg>
<seg id="874">The main mission of FŘ SR is the effective collection and administration of taxes and duties, i.e. also excise duties, to fulfil the income part of the state budget and protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The statutory body of FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="876">The President of the Financial Administration is responsible for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore for the activities of FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">Organization structure of FŘ SR from 1. 1. 2012 in short form</seg>
<seg id="878">In addition to branches of customs offices (38 branches) and stations of customs offices (18 stations), excise departments (9 departments) and legal departments (9 departments) provide activities and processes for the administration of excise duties in the territory of the SR.</seg>

<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">In 2015, 74 organizational departments with a total of 1,300 employees dealt with excise duties in the framework of the financial administration structure of SR, in addition to FŘ SR; these services are managed by almost 48,000 tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organisational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, approximately 60 organizational departments with a total of 1,011 employees managed by approximately 114,000 tax entities were involved in excise tax administration in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual excise tax management activities is divided into several staff-independent departments.</seg>
<seg id="888">Their mutual coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle- and top-level management.</seg>
<seg id="889">In SR, the performance of individual activities (registration, tax returns, tax control) in the field of excise tax administration is divided between the excise department and the branch of the customs office, under which the same employees of the tax administration often deal with the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="891">In SR there is approximately a third of the number of tax entities per total number of employees in excise tax administration compared to the state of the Czech Republic; the effect of more employees on the efficiency of excise duty management is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/ES of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, establishing an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products, The aim is to establish an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products to enable real-time information on transport to be obtained and to carry out the required checks; simplify the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing the system, Member States should allow economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article 3 of that Decision allows the EP and the Council to include in the EMCS the national specifications, the national databases forming part of the system and the technical or programming equipment deemed necessary by the Member State to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by the system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">The EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1.4.2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">The so-called customs module and declarant module were introduced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains a number of national functions.</seg>
<seg id="902">In addition to the Community system, the EMCS system in the Czech Republic monitors movements under suspension of taxes initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">The system ensures the automatic dispatch of the information to the tax registry after approval of the notification of receipt of the consignment intended for the authorised consignee for one-off receipt, followed by the revocation of the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="904">The system fully ensures administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including sending responses with an attachment in any format and arranging translations.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive a report on the manual cessation of exports in the ECS (only the assignment of automatically generated messages is implemented in the EU).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">The EMCS shall not permit the approval of an e-AD or an acceptance notification without the response of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (risk profile cannot be ignored).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available for tax entities free of charge, it takes the form of a web application in which the user logs in by user name and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with the CS CR.</seg>
<seg id="909">Any action against the EMCS customs module shall bear a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declaration module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The Declarant Module allows tax entities to directly record data on commenced and terminated services under the suspension scheme, so that tax entities do not have to spend money on acquiring the system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module allow data to be read and stored off-line (saving time for frequently used data), filling in beneficiary data on the basis of a SEED ID check and requiring mandatory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows for real-time blocking of excise security of the corresponding amount of taxable supplies to every shipment sent from the Czech Republic until the end of transport.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by the EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without sufficient security, the EMCS declaratory module does not allow the e-AD proposal to be sent for approval to the CA for dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each warranty has a unique number and includes the ARC transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declaratory module, where it sees the current amount of the blocked and unlocked excise guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on the deployment and use of the EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">The development of the EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight contracts with fulfilment from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924,60 (i.e. € 1,761,412,56) excluding VAT.</seg>
<seg id="919">In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. €1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">During the audited period expenses totalling CZK 14,545,454 without VAT (i.e. € 547,438,99) were incurred for the EMCS system upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade in the audited period and converted into one transport transferred to the EMCS amounts to an average of CZK 16.49 (i.e. €0.62), excluding national funds, is CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92) per transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="922">The EMCS technical support was implemented on the basis of four contracts with fulfilment from 2011 to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">The total amount of technical support totalling CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. € 281,389,77) including value added tax was invoiced by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport transferred to the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">The invoices for development and technical support concerned the national solution and developed the EVV application, which was already operated by the GŘC before the EMCS system itself.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were covered by programme funding from national sources.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of the delivery of services to other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in SR</seg>
<seg id="929">The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying administrative document - SAD, which was used before the efficiency of this system, and thus ensured better control and management of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="931">It has been introduced in the SR since 1.4.2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique reference code is generated for each transport.</seg>
<seg id="933">ARC code under which the said traffic can be monitored online, i.e. in real time.</seg>
<seg id="934">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="935">The EMCS provides for the reception and dispatch of excise goods only by tax entities authorised to use the EMCS, thereby greatly reducing the risk of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="936">The greatest development of functionalities occurred in 2011 when the EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).</seg>
<seg id="937">Expenditure on the deployment and use of the EMCS</seg>
<seg id="938">The introduction of the EMCS system was implemented as another module of SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to determine exactly the amount of costs of its initial application on the Slovak side.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The objective of the EMCS was to replace the system based on the administration of transport in paper form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The EMCS benefits from a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU from the notification of the start of transport to the end of transport, while reducing administrative costs for tax administrations and tax entities for the processing, transfer and archiving of documents is important.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing monitoring of transport in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="944">In the Czech Republic, the automatic functionality of online monitoring and guarantee of excise duty is applied.</seg>
<seg id="945">National functionality is also introduced, which monitors the riskiness of the taxpayer or transport, with the subsequent mandatory response of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="946">The SR and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of exchanges within the EU in the EMCS system.</seg>
<seg id="947">However, the expenditure incurred in the SR to upgrade this system was €744 310.01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="948">The SAO SR obtained data from FŘ SR on the upgrade of the EMCS system only for the period from 2011, even though the system had been established and operated before.</seg>
<seg id="949">Nevertheless, the expenses incurred to upgrade the EMCS system in SR were EUR 188,134,44 higher than the costs incurred to implement and upgrade the EMCS system in approximately ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="950">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="951">For the audited period, the amount of expenditure related to the upgrade of the EMCS system in SR per transport exceeds 2.3 times that of the same type in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR met the objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both audit institutions acquired a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="955">It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in the two tax systems that affect the efficiency of excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">Examples of good practice have been identified during parallel checks, which could contribute to the reduction of tax fraud, their importance as tax rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures to reduce the cost of excise duty management have also been identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons unless mutually coordinated due diligence is carried out with the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">This makes the role of supreme audit institutions indispensable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the parallel control of the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The 1977 Lima Declaration stresses that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) have the power to audit all public financing operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be controlled to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">It considers the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) to be one of the most important components of public tax revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">VI. the EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenues carried out by the SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">An important step towards optimising the control activities of the SAI is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="8">This concerns, in particular, taxes as the most subtle source of public revenue, which is most susceptible to large losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may, to a certain extent, be unable to carry out control activities without cooperation with another State's SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="10">An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the income of many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">To combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAIs carrying out checks in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">Right on VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn has developed the idea of controlling the administration of value added tax (VAT) and the VIES system in the framework of cooperation between the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">This was followed by careful preparation, where both parties first had to familiarize themselves with the legal environment and procedures for the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the basis of an analysis of this information, a selection was made of the control topics included in the control programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving effective and efficient VAT management is a long-term problem and individual countries (in particular the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We believe that the results of our control can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the results of parallel checks on the administration of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of inspection:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Administration of value added tax after the Czech Republic joins the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Control objective:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The aim of the audit action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the Single Internal Market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as "the EU") linked to the free movement of goods and services and to verify the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to value added tax exemption for intracommunitary supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intra-Community value added tax with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.</seg>
<seg id="28">System of exchange of information on value added tax Audits were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected business transactions between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic") and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany"), the use of information obtained through international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The joint final report on the results of the audit actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive No 31 for the implementation of the audit standards of INTOSAI.</seg>
<seg id="31">The controlled period was the period from 1.5.2004 to 31.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel control in the field of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Outside the main point - information exchanges based on Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 - control covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and summary reports, which are closely linked to the main point.</seg>
<seg id="35">Moreover, the check included the legal situation in the area of international bus transport of passengers and the comparison of some statistical data.</seg>
<seg id="36">A comparison of the VAT management systems of the two countries identified differences in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="38">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) for registration is the exceedance of the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is allocated to payers, which they also use in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Germany a tax number is allocated to the payers at the time of registration for VAT, which is used only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the German payer intracommunitary transactions intend to take place, he must request the assignment of a special identification number, VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">As different marketing authorisations cause problems, conditions should be settled across the EU (see. 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus transport of persons.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct VAT.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of the transport carried out on German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of the Council Directive on the common system of VAT (see. 4.2)</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the Czech Republic the payers submit VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany the payers are obliged to submit so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they have to submit an annual VAT tax return.</seg>
<seg id="49">Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns for VAT in the Czech Republic electronically would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see. 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="52">While in the Czech Republic payers submit summary reports to the tax authorities, in Germany the payers submit summary reports to the Customs Office.</seg>
<seg id="53">The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have data from the summary reports immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">The information from the summary reports is only available to the German tax authorities after their processing into Customs.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires that updated information on intracommunity transactions be made available as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the time shift between the date of the transaction and the update of the data in the VIES.</seg>
<seg id="57">This would subsequently allow timely verification of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see. 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">This would, however, require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for the submission of a summary report.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Czech Customs Office monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for received requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German Customs Office does not monitor the passage of time.</seg>
<seg id="62">Consequently, the German tax administration handled a significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the time limit.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems, BRH recommended that the German CLO carry out a permanent alert (see. 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each Member State develops its own risk management system (RMS), which has both strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and the BRH point out that effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5th).</seg>
<seg id="68">Within the cooperation, both SAIs examined selected cases of intracommunity transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thirty-one cases of commercial transactions where there were doubts as to their implementation or suspicion of VAT evasion were examined together with the Customs legislation.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation and charged the taxpayer with VAT.</seg>
<seg id="72">In these cases, the payers either wrongly claimed the VAT exemption or did not grant the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">There were cases where payers erroneously reported business transactions in aggregate reports.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result, the data in VIES were incorrect and tax administrations had to examine these cases (see. 6.).</seg>
<seg id="78">Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="79">Course of control action in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the Department of State Budget Revenue and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited persons were: The Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as "the Ministry of Finance") and 10 tax authorities - the Financial Office in Humpolec, the Tax Office in Jihlava, the Tax Office in Kadana, the Tax Office in Liberec, the Tax Office in Nymburg, the Tax Office in Otrokovice, the Tax Office Office for Prague 1, Prague 4</seg>
<seg id="82">The audit conclusion of this audit action was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Progress of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Indirect Tax Control Group and the staff of the designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">The audit was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal MF in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After the test phase, the check started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by BRH and later chosen by the SAO, BRH had to notify the control of a number of federal states.</seg>
<seg id="88">In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance and Customs, the check was carried out in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine - Vestfal, Rhine-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FA for corporations/legal entities (Munich-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Central (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-north), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn centre (Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne centre (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne South (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustine, Pirmasens, Budysin (Bautzen), Chemnitz South (Chemnitz-Süd), Dresden II (Dresden II), Freiberg, Leipzig I (Leipzig I) and Zschopau.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, negotiations took place with the Financial Office of Augsburg-city (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old city (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The report on the control findings was submitted to the MF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">Several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions took place in the run-up to the parallel control actions.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants of these meetings became acquainted with the organization of tax administrations, the legislative regulation of VAT issues and the system of VAT administration in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">At the meeting held in May 2006, the topics of the test phase were agreed.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the test phase were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">In the course of this meeting, a timetable for further work was agreed and the following themes of parallel checks were identified:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registration of payers for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International bus transport of passengers - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrations in processing requests for information and examination of selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistics on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="110">At the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with each other with the control process in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel control actions.</seg>
<seg id="111">The report on the results of parallel VAT administration checks between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a workshop in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registration of payers in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="115">According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Charges (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 337/1992 Coll."), the taxpayer, the taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person who is defined as a tax entity by law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421 865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="117">At 1 December 2005 the number of tax entities registered for VAT increased to 457,590.</seg>
<seg id="118">The taxable person who has his registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, shall become the payer from the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (Section 94 (2)). 1 Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter referred to as "Act No 235/2004 Coll.").</seg>
<seg id="119">This person is obliged to file an application within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not allow the taxable person to be registered retroactively in cases where the reason for registration is in excess of the legal limit for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with a right of deduction may become a tax payer, even if the turnover does not exceed CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) if he fulfils any of the other conditions specified in Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down by law may apply for registration for VAT on a voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="123">The registration procedure under Act No. 337/1992 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="124">The voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate the date on which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the taxpayer, i.e. the completed registration application with all the annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If it has doubts about the data, it shall invite the tax entity to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">After the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, it shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate of registration and a tax identification number ("TIC").</seg>
<seg id="128">The tax administrator shall indicate on the certificate the effective date of registration for VAT and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax period is the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">The payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and will notify the tax administrator of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="133">The allocation of the VAT in the registration certificate is always constitutive and the tax entity is obliged to indicate it in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special act (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The TS contains the code "CZ" and the stem part which forms the generic identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">The general identifier for a natural person is the birth number, or another general identifier, if so provided for by a special law, and for a legal person the identification number (provisions of § 33 para. 12 Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax entity has not fulfilled its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, the local tax administrator shall register it without delay.</seg>
<seg id="137">The result of the registration procedure is the issue of a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which is served on the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the Czech Republic, the tax entity which has obtained a business authorisation is assigned a tax at the time of its first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The same VAT is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1.1. 2005, the tax administrator may, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT registration obligation, impose a refund of up to 10% on the total revenue or income for taxable transactions, which that person has wrongly effected free of tax, for the period from the date; to which she was legally to be a registered payer, until the date, to which, by decision of the tax administration, she became a registered payer (provisions of § 98 para. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of the amount thus determined shall be regarded as payment of tax (§ 98 para. 3 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a sanction.</seg>
<seg id="142">Cancellation of registration of the VAT payer when fulfilling the statutory conditions is possible for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (§ 106 para. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">The payer shall be entitled to apply for cancellation at the earliest 1 year after the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of registration "ex officio" (§ 106 para. 7 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), if: (a) the payer has not performed without notice the reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State, which has no registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person, which performs transactions with the place of supply in the country and is the person liable to declare and pay tax on such transactions pursuant to Section 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (so-called "non-established payer"), becomes the payer on the date of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to file an application for registration with the Financial Office for Prague 1 at the latest by the date of implementation.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the application for registration, it is obliged to indicate all the taxes allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If the "non-established" payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Tax Office for Prague 1 will retroactively register it because of the Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="151">In retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires proof from tax entities that the transaction has been carried out (invoices or explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If the "non-established" tax entity requests registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable transaction is made, then the Tax Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts for the performance to take place.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of 31 December 2004, 473 "non-established" payers were registered at the Financial Office for Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005, 951 "non-established" payers were registered, including 233 from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">According to the provisions of § 106 para. 9 Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the "non-established" payer on 31 January of the following calendar year, provided that the payer has not been obliged to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="155">The audit of the SAO found that if a "non-established" payer lodges a tax return abroad for carriage of mail on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the statutory regulation at the date for filing the tax return, the tax office often does not have it available on 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where the facts relevant for the possibility of cancellation of registration to the tax office are known later than 31 January, in the Czech Republic it is not possible to cancel VAT registration in a given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of payers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§ § 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as "AO"), anyone engaged in business activities is obliged to inform the municipal/municipal office or the relevant tax office.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">This information is processed by the Municipal Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax office identifies an undertaking that has begun operations but has not registered, the competent tax authority may register the taxpayer under official authority - even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers who are tax resident and non-resident in Germany are legally obliged to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act ("UStG").</seg>
<seg id="163">This obligation does not depend on the turnover they realise.</seg>
<seg id="164">There is no voluntary registration for VAT in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">There are special tax authorities for entrepreneurs living permanently abroad.</seg>
<seg id="166">For example, for those who have their registered office in the Czech Republic, the competent Financial Office is Chemnitz-Süd.</seg>
<seg id="167">At 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs had been registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since the employment permits of employees from the 10 new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These companies do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Section 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working time and the manner in which they carry out their work.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the competent tax authority, in which he must provide information about the company and the activities it carries out.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is handled either by special departments of the tax authorities or by general-interest departments responsible for assessing taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">This form is used to assess the risk of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues the tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">The first three digits provide information about the competent tax office, the next three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the next five (or four) are for differentiation of payers, the last being always the control digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intracommunity trade, he needs a VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an intracommunity supply exempt.</seg>
<seg id="178">Customs shall assign VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="179">Customs assigns VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when the payer indicates intracommunity delivery in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">The VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.</seg>
<seg id="181">Registration of an entrepreneur may be cancelled: 1 at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business activities), after all administrative work has been carried out (assessment for all marketing years) and 2 when the tax administration realises that he no longer engages in business activities.</seg>
<seg id="182">The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT tax number.</seg>
<seg id="183">In such cases, the tax authorities are obliged to inform Customs about the abolition of the tax number so that the Customs Code can expire for VAT purposes.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in the event that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and the following year the latter is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.</seg>
<seg id="185">So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice VAT to other entrepreneurs and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur may declare that there will be no provision of § 19 para. 1 UStG apply.</seg>
<seg id="188">This confession is binding on him for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">For tax non-residents there is the possibility to appoint tax representatives (Section 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The prerequisite is that they carry out exclusively exempt business operations and are not entitled to an entry tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="192">The function of the tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign businessman who does not have to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">Invoices shall include information on representation for tax purposes.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) for registration is the exceedance of the limit laid down in the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="197">If the tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the set limit, it has the possibility to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration process is standardized in Germany, but different organisational models in the federal states may result in differences.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a tax at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">If the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same VAT in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, a tax number is allocated to the taxpayer when registering for VAT, which is used only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German payer intracommunitary transactions intend to take place, he must request the assignment of a special identification number, VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">As the SAO and the BRH have established, Germany's two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, as in the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, a two-tier system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax authority of their business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration allows the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax period, in particular an accurate estimate of VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">As different marketing authorisations cause problems, conditions should be settled across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="207">The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Credit Card).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Taxation Office will allocate the VAT at birth of the natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This VAT will be valid throughout the life of the natural person who is a German resident.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business, the competent tax authority shall apply for an economic tax credit card to be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">In the future, there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">Work on introducing an IT device to manage the TID has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="213">International bus transport of passengers</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="215">According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. with effect from 1. 5. 2004, the transport of persons between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with a right of deduction.</seg>
<seg id="216">This transport is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by businesses registered for tax in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="217">Return transport shall be regarded as a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If "non-established" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activities besides international bus services, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="219">International transport of persons was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V of the Council. Article 5 (5) 1 font. b) where:</seg>
<seg id="220">"For the purposes of Art. Article 28 (2) 3 fonts. b) Directive 77/388/EHS the Czech Republic may continue to exempt from value added tax from international passenger transport in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Art. Article 28 (2) This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="221">Description of the legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/ES of 28 November 2006, implemented under Section 3b (1) of the Treaty. 1 of the German VAT Act is the place where the carriage of passengers (i.e. transport services) takes place (i.e. where the carriage takes place).</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable provision of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.</seg>
<seg id="226">If the tax non-resident carries passengers through Germany, the part of the route which takes place in Germany also constitutes a taxable provision of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">The tax non-resident must notify the competent tax office of his intention to provide passenger transport before carrying out his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office shall register this non-resident for tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notification.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable supply of transport in the German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">On 1 March 2006, the Tax Office of Chemnitz-Süd registered 741 Czech payers who carried passengers.</seg>
<seg id="231">If passenger transport is provided to a tax resident who is a person liable for VAT, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax office itself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead, the entity obliged to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the tax non-resident is the tax resident who is the recipient of the services; this process is known as "reverse charge" and complies with Article 196 of the 2006/112/ES Council Directive.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to the notification of the tax non-resident and his VAT return, the German tax administration has several means of assessing the accuracy of the taxable provision of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="234">The mobile control groups of the customs office carry out audits of certificates of buses licensed for foreign transport, which are used for the carriage of passengers via Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit, mobile control groups shall send a control report to the competent financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group shall be entitled to request VAT from the bus driver before continuing the next transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">A non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid on the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit to be carried out in the office of the tax office or it may use the administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if a tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT charged in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may request administrative cooperation under the Council Directive.</seg>
<seg id="240">In order to review the VAT return or the fulfilment of the obligations of a non-resident, the BRH considers all such administrative cooperation to be too labour intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for the taxable provision of passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="241">In particular, the audit of the accounting of the tax non-resident incurs disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The tax administration must audit foreign accounting, which means not only the need for foreign language knowledge, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">The audit of this type is also likely to require more time than the audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger services carried out in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, a non-resident may not only accept the right to carry out checks which are the responsibility of his national tax administration, but also the right to carry out audits by other Member States in which he carries passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">Moreover, in any Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all tax obligations applicable to it in those Member States, in all languages and in all tax forms of those Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore incurs disproportionate bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between individual EU Member States or between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic with a right of deduction.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport carried out in the German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">Where such carriage is provided by a non-established payer in Germany for the first time, he shall notify the competent tax authority in advance of the provision of the carriage.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable supply of part of the shipment in the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="253">Implementation of the law is very time consuming in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office carry passengers.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the effort, the tax return, if realised, is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.</seg>
<seg id="257">In order to avoid disproportionate VAT costs, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport starts or where the provider resides.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require adaptation of the Council Directive.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="262">The payer is obliged to file a VAT return on a form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if he has not been taxed unless the law provides otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability is payable within the time limit for filing the VAT return, except for the tax charged in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., for which the maturity of the tax is determined by customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If the overcompensation results in a refundable overpayment, the payer shall return without request within 30 days of the overcompensation.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator launches a tax procedure concerning the payer's tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with the provisions of § 73 para. 11 Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the right of deduction may be claimed in an ordinary VAT return at the latest for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right of deduction may have been claimed.</seg>
<seg id="267">After the expiry of this period, the right to deduct may be further claimed within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct may have been claimed at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is only possible by filing an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1.1.2005, it is only possible to submit an additional VAT return for the period during which the right to deduct could be claimed for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="270">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if (a) the totality of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) the correction is carried out where the last known tax liability does not change, but only the data previously claimed by the taxpayer, (c) the correction of the rate and amount of the tax pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">The payer may submit an additional VAT return if it reduces the tax liability by aggregating the corrections.</seg>
<seg id="272">The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">The submission of the VAT return in electronic form can be made through the Internet or on a technical data medium.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submission via the Internet may be made as a submission with a data message bearing a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not backed by a guaranteed electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the case of submissions with a data message not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature, submission is still required in writing, i.e. delivery of the computer report to the tax administrator (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values of intracommunity supplies/acquisitions of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">Acquisition of services is recorded on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated control within the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of supplies of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with the data provided in the summary reports filed by Czech payers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The values of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through the VIES system from the aggregate reports of payers from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="281">At the tax office, the ADIS system tests the credibility of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test takes place automatically, as VAT returns cannot be measured without performing the test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The credibility test includes the calculation of the credibility criteria and the evaluation of the risk types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">According to the provisions of § 37 para. 1 Act No. 337/1992 Coll. the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on the person who fails to comply with the obligation of a non-monetary nature under this or special tax law or by decision under this Act.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system used by the FA for technical support of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities generally did not take advantage of the possibility to impose a fine on the payers for not filing a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany, we distinguish between the preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are required to submit provisional VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="291">In general, taxpayers are obliged to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which the VAT is incurred (Section 18, par. 2 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT requirement exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year or if it is a newly established undertaking, the relevant entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day of the following month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also decide to submit a monthly VAT return if a refund exceeded EUR 6,136 in the last year (§ 18 para. 2a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns need not be lodged if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The relevant amount of VAT liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT was incurred.</seg>
<seg id="296">The refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FA.</seg>
<seg id="297">There are no time limits (according to the law) for the processing of tax returns and the refund of excessive VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="298">In order to recover the tax in good time, it is possible to offer collateral for the amount to be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="299">The basic principle is to process VAT returns and refund the tax quickly.</seg>
<seg id="300">The German VAT law provides for the possibility of extending this period (§ 18 para. 6 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such an extension should be requested separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT duty a month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.</seg>
<seg id="303">This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT charge.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever an error is detected, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="305">There is no additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct the erroneous advance tax return, but only the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">Correction of the annual VAT return for the benefit or disadvantage of the payer is possible during the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.</seg>
<seg id="308">After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">The payers are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="311">Submission of an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If it is made without certification, the payer must submit the return once more on paper with personal signatures.</seg>
<seg id="313">If the payer does not submit a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In case of late filing, a penalty payment may be imposed on the payer (up to a maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).</seg>
<seg id="315">During the previous inspection, BRH found that tax authorities often did not measure this standard fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was calculated inconsistently and arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="317">The standard fine therefore fails to meet its objective of reducing the average delay, especially when submitting the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The VAT return contains separate lines relating to intracommunity delivery/acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">Acquisition of services is recorded on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions must be reported on the separate line of the tax return/VAT.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the case of VAT returns which are submitted in paper form, a copy must be made either via a scanner or by staff specially authorised to do so.</seg>
<seg id="322">Data from VAT returns submitted electronically shall be immediately available to the tax office officer.</seg>
<seg id="323">Once all the data has been entered into the system, RMS staff will go through it and select cases that meet certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="324">The selected VAT returns must be reviewed by a tax office official on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.</seg>
<seg id="325">(see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration must roughly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer must pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, taxpayers submit VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on the amount of the payer's turnover, the tax period shall be either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, the payers submit advance VAT returns, depending on the previous year's tax liability, either within 10 days of the end of the calendar quarter or months.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May of the following year, payers are obliged to file an annual tax return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly provisional) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">- if the payer corrects the admitted intracommunity transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the summary report is made;</seg>
<seg id="335">- the Federal States do not normally compare VIES data on intracommunity acquisitions of German payers before processing the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see. 4.1.3) German payers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return irrespective of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This obligation allows the German financial authority to examine the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and final accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only on the tax returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="340">Unlike the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany are obliged to submit tax returns for VAT in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="341">The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Summary reports</seg>
<seg id="343">Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="344">According to Section 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. a payer who has delivered goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Data on the value of the goods supplied are always given in the Czech currency broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT ID, under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on the services provided shall not be entered in SH.</seg>
<seg id="347">SH shall be filed by the payer with a monthly and quarterly tax period for each calendar quarter within 25 days of its closure to the locally competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="348">Correction of incorrect data is performed in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">Erroneous data referred to in the SH shall always be replaced by those specified in the subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="350">Like tax returns, SH can be filed electronically by the payer.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the payer does not submit SH or subsequent SH and had it according to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. submit, invite the tax administrator to submit it and inform the tax administrator of the consequences in the event of non-filing of SH or SH, i.e. that the tax administrator is in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for failure to comply with non-monetary obligations.</seg>
<seg id="352">The audit of the SAO found that the tax authorities generally did not take advantage of the possibility of imposing a fine on the payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">In particular, in the case of SH submissions, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations because the non-submission of SH does not affect the VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">The tax administrator is obliged under Section 102 para. 5 Act No. 235/2004 Coll. to examine the data in the SH or subsequent SH, where appropriate, to remove any ambiguities and use the data to determine the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">In case of inconsistency of data in the SH and data in the relevant (payer with monthly tax period) or the relevant (payer with quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administration should verify the accuracy of the tax liability declared in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">Incorrect data in SH will be removed by the tax entity by filing a subsequent SH itself, or it may be called upon to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">- the payer fails to demonstrate the particulars given in the SH (or subsequent SH), correcting them by submitting a subsequent SH,</seg>
<seg id="359">- the tax administrator has demonstrated that the information provided by the payer in the SH or subsequent SH is not true.</seg>
<seg id="360">The tax administrator, by inserting a correction without filing a subsequent SH by the payer, does not replace the filing of the tax entity, only adjusts the data in the VIES database to be up-to-date, complete and accurate.</seg>
<seg id="361">SH data shall be sent to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="362">They may only be dispatched and received by the national financial administration for cooperation with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is Customs (in the Czech Republic performs this function of the MF, Department of International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (Customs).</seg>
<seg id="363">is the automatic message that Customs receives from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">Contains all incorrect VAT IDs specified in sent lines of SH.</seg>
<seg id="365">If an incorrect VAT ID is used in one of the conveyed common lines of SH or subsequent SH, an entry is made in the table of incorrect VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains the so-called "VAT ID Doubts Notice."</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator checks the data and records the verification result in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer shall declare VAT and indicate the value of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">The selected cases of irregularities in the value of the goods acquired declared by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and in the value of the goods delivered, as stated by the payers from other Member States in their SH, are sent from Customs to the tax office for examination.</seg>
<seg id="370">Tax administrators are obliged to investigate irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="371">There may be three situations:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant VAT return lines is lower than the value declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator will verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The difference amount is 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself submits an additional VAT return in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether, despite this fact, it will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxpayer in the respective lines of the VAT return is higher than the value of the delivered goods declared by EU payers.</seg>
<seg id="378">It is also at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After examining the difference and clarifying the causes of its occurrence, the tax administrator shall enter the result of the verification into ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of the screening are transmitted back to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of cases sent from Customs to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005 is shown in Chart 1 (source: MF).</seg>
<seg id="382">Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted from Customs to the tax authorities for each quarter of 2005 decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">A significant decrease in numbers occurred in the 4 2005 quarter. Customs has increased the minimum threshold, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error arising from the fact that certain types of transactions may be introduced into the SH in a different way in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for irregularities in reported transaction values found at audited financial offices are set out in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Administration and processing of summary reports in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs making intracommunity deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participating in triangular transactions are obliged to submit SH every quarter of the year in which intracommunity supplies are indicated by beneficiaries (§ 18a para. 1 UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">SH must be filed by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If an extension of this period is allowed in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to SH.</seg>
<seg id="391">SH must be supplied to the Customs.</seg>
<seg id="392">They must be submitted electronically from 1 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="393">Exemptions may be allowed by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realise that incorrect data are given in SH, they are obliged to submit a corrective report within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">In the event that taxpayers do not submit an SH, Customs will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of that report.</seg>
<seg id="396">Part of this procedure is: - the first reminder - the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine/penalty payment and - penalty payment.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Tax Code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (Section 329 AO), the Customs Code measures fines in three steps, in amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">In addition, § 26a para. UStG 1 No 5 stipulates that payers act illegally if they deliberately or negligently fail to properly submit an SH, file it incomplete, submit it in a timely manner or if they do not correct or correct it late.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intracommunity supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because the processing of SH is the sole task of Customs.</seg>
<seg id="401">SH data are stored only in the CLO system.</seg>
<seg id="402">Therefore, the SH data are visually available only after processing into customs.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing SH are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">SH data shall be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">Where incorrect VAT IDs are included in the SH of German payers, Customs shall receive the O_MCTL codes from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">Customs contacts a specific entrepreneur and asks for the correct information.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the Customs Authority fails to obtain correct information, the case shall be referred to the competent tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">During the inspection, BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected VAT ID at the request of Customs.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, in cases where a payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud, the challenge, threat and assessment of three additional fines take too much time.</seg>
<seg id="411">These cases, which were eventually reported to the competent tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The tax office rejected the exemption of declared intracommunity supplies in 73% of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the tax office asked him to file a corrected SH against the Customs Authority because the tax authorities could not correct the data in the VIES themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor Customs inspected the submission of the corrected SH, so the payers often failed to comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">In view of the fact that the Customs Office does not have access to VAT return data, a comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and SH will not take place before the submission of these data to the Customs of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data obtained from other Member States shall be processed into Customs.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and subsequently submitted to the Member States concerned.</seg>
<seg id="419">This data shall be used for the purpose of checking acquisitions carried out by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="420">Once they are entered into the system, the CLO checks them on the basis of a comparison with the data from the previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is generated and sent to the competent financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="422">This procedure is applied permanently, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure subsequently checks these data with intracommunity acquisitions data.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the Czech Republic, payers who have delivered goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State submit an SH within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax office.</seg>
<seg id="427">The tax authorities shall process the SH and transmit the data to the Customs Authority.</seg>
<seg id="428">The value of the delivery of goods to another Member State, indicated by the payer in the SH, is compared at the tax offices with the value of the supply of goods to another Member State indicated by those payers in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">The results of the comparison are used in the measurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, payers who have made intracommunity deliveries are obliged to submit SH quarterly by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">SH payers are submitted to the CLO, from 1.1.2007 in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="432">The tax authorities only have information from SH after processing it into Customs.</seg>
<seg id="433">Payers from both the Czech Republic and Germany indicate only the supply of goods in the SH. The provision of services is not mentioned in the SH.</seg>
<seg id="434">Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are unable to correct erroneous lines filed by SH themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">As a result of this limited access to German VIES data, the incorrect VAT ID has not been corrected, even though the payer provided the correct VAT ID to the FA.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German Tax Administration does not compare the information on intracommunity supplies contained in the VAT return of the German payer and its SH.</seg>
<seg id="437">The differences between the data of these two statements are not normally detected before the German Customs Office provides data from VIES to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">In view of the findings of the BRH, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in the VIES.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on the delivery of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">The comparison shall be carried out by Customs separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most significant cases of irregularities are transmitted to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in payers' tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general check is only processed for payers who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="444">Moreover, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intracommunity acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control notice or if the payer is intended for inspection anyway.</seg>
<seg id="445">This procedure relieves the tax authorities of the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand, VAT fraud detection depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Combating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intracommunity acquisitions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current SH system, specifically VIES, provides financial authorities with information that may be up to six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This delay may be reduced by up to four months if the payer administers SH per month.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly submission would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, since most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit tax returns on a monthly basis - and SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.</seg>
<seg id="451">In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, SH's submission may be linked to the filing of a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, the obligation to submit SH on a monthly basis would cause more time mismatches between the reporting of intracommunity supply and intracommunity acquisition and could increase the flow of data between Customs.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006, the German Federal Government considered the general provisions of monthly SHs.</seg>
<seg id="454">Its implementation failed due to the doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">These feared that the monthly submission of VIES data to the Customs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact, if the monthly SH and monthly data transmission obligations were to be effective, a monthly update of the VIES would require a European monthly SH standard.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistics on delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">In the context of foreign trade, Germany represents the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total volumes of intracommunity transactions in goods carried out between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">Both SAIs requested data on the number of incorrect tax credits or VAT IDs contained in the reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">These differences may be due to the different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="464">While Czech Customs refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, German Customs refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of level 3 information</seg>
<seg id="466">Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="467">The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States concerning intra-community commercial transactions and the payers who have carried out such transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">International exchange of information on request takes the form of so-called information requests (hereinafter referred to as "JHA"), using standardised SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="470">The tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their JORs, or responses to the received JORs through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which ensures translation of the information provided on the standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also ensures the income of JOI from other Member States and the responses to sent to JOI, their translation into Czech and distribution to local tax administrations for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">In Art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 provides for a maximum period of 3 months from receipt of an application for the processing of the JHA.</seg>
<seg id="473">The SAO was audited by all SAO, handed over during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="474">Of the 94 RU admitted in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were settled within a specified three-month period, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were settled after that deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany until the SAO was checked.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information on the deadlines within which replies to the JHA received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic contains chart 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the 335 JHA shipped from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) reply received within the three-month deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53,4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and on 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) no response was received from Germany until the SAO was checked. (in the remaining 1 cases, it was not possible to determine from the data transmitted when the response from Germany was received).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the time limits within which the replies to the JHA sent to the Czech Republic were delivered to the Czech Republic is given in Chart 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentage of intracommunity transaction values reported in the JHA passed between the Czech Republic and Germany contains Chart 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">As can be seen from the above chart, the value of commercial transactions examined through the JHA was most frequently in the range above EUR 60 000.</seg>
<seg id="480">International exchange of information without prior request takes the form of either automatic or structured automatic exchange of information or spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax administrations from other Member States are often forwarded, without prior request, information that may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Czech Republic, all information is collected on Customs.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is transmitted electronically between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">"Automatic exchange" means, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">"Structured automatic exchange" means systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and as soon as the information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on the delivery of new means of transport by automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available to the tax administrator from the New Means of Transport Delivery Report form pursuant to Section 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and a copy of the tax document issued.</seg>
<seg id="488">The tax administrator shall complete the necessary data in a specially created template when processing the aforementioned form and forward it to the contact officer at the Financial Directorate, where the data are collected and within a specified date, i.e. no later than two months from the end of the quarter in which the information was made available, to the Customs Office for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="489">In addition, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on consignment sales that are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU operations that appear to be unauthorized and information on potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="490">That information is sent to other Member States by means of a spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany, both requests for information and spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly to the German Customs, which transmits the SCAC forms to foreign customs.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information controlled by BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of intracommunity acquisitions in another Member State and, where appropriate, to demonstrate the exemption of intracommunity supplies from Germany to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="496">If the German Customs Office receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of the goods or services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="497">In the absence of a reasonable reason for such a request, the German Customs Office shall reject any application containing an amount below that limit.</seg>
<seg id="498">In addition, the German Customs Office shall translate free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are not in German or English.</seg>
<seg id="499">In order to respond to a request for information, the Customs Office shall send the request to the Competent Tax Office with a reference to the three-month period.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no further deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German Customs Authority has technical conditions for monitoring past time limits, it lacks sufficient personnel capacity to alert the tax authorities to reply to outstanding requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax authorities shall obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">Auditors usually choose between two distinct types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months, or a so-called VAT inspection, which may cover only one recent commercial operation.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and ﬂexibilní type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has demonstrated its utility in investigating individual taxable business operations.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the context of automatic exchange without prior request, the CFN provides other Member States with information - on VAT IDs allocated to payers resident in other Member States - on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">Moreover, the CFN has undertaken to provide other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. shipping or catalogue sales in other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intracommunity acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intracommunitary supply of goods which the German payer did not declare in SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "missing trader" who made intracommunitary transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who delivered goods to potential "missing traders" or those recipients who misused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">The dispatch of JOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the local tax authorities that send the completed SCAC form to Customs.</seg>
<seg id="510">While Czech Customs uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech - English) and translates the sent information into English or German, German tax authorities follow the instruction to write JOI or spontaneous information only in German on a single-language form.</seg>
<seg id="511">German Customs does not ensure the translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">During the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 between the Czech Republic and the CFN, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration handled 74,5% of the submitted applications within a specified period of three months.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German Customs Authority draws the attention of the tax authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor past time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The result of missing notifications is a large number of delayed responses to JOI.</seg>
<seg id="515">Due to these problems, the BRH recommended regular warnings to Customs.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to the latest information, the German Customs Authority is now alerting the tax authorities to answer unfinished responses to the JHA.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Czech Republic, several departments at various organisational levels of tax administration deal with the management of VAT risks.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the MF, the following departments deal with risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">The VAT Methodology and Performance Department and the VAT Risk Management Report, which, among other things, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends of these risks at the domestic and community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">Nationally, it coordinates the functioning of the role of Credibility of VAT tax returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intracommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">Based on data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risk commodities, processes conceptually VAT risk management and cooperates with relevant EU institutions and other Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in the Management of VAT, which, inter alia, ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">Both SAIs requested data on the number of incorrect tax credits or VAT IDs contained in the reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">The data show substantial differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">These differences may be due to the different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="530">While Czech Customs refers their numbers to the calendar quarter for which the SH was submitted, German Customs refers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Department of Tax Control and Search Methodology, which, inter alia, carries out risk analysis within the framework of methodological tax control management and sets out the priorities for the targeting of tax controls in the Financial Directorate plans, prepares risk analyses in the context of tax evasion reduction, including the collection of lessons learned from tax administration and other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Search departments are set up in the Financial Directorates, which carry out, inter alia, searches for tax entities and areas that are risky from the point of view of the occurrence of tax fraud. (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), search of unregistered tax entities for risks of tax evasion (E.G. internet services, job brokering, radio and print services, etc.), analysis of chain fraud links and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">At the selected 12 financial offices, specialised control departments are set up.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional jurisdiction, tax controls outside the territorial scope of the tax authorities are carried out on the basis of mandate.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to set up a specialised tax control unit has arisen on the basis of increasing findings of new and better forms of tax evasion, which occur primarily among entities linked to chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinationals and tax entities with a large range of activities in terms of turnover size.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms to reduce VAT risks have been integrated into ADIS: - the role of the credibility of VAT returns used to evaluate the risk of tax returns filed, - the role of the Selection of tax entities to check, allowing the collection of payers to check on the basis of selected criteria, - the role of VIES through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The role of VIES allows, inter alia: - to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, - obtain from other Member States the value of the goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, - generate a set of non-SH payers - carry out a formal data check, which payers from the Czech Republic have indicated in the SH, before such data is sent to other Member States, - generate a set of payers for whom the information on the supply of goods to other Member States referred to in the VAT declarations does not match the data in the SH, - generate a set of payers for whom the value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States referred to in VAT declarations does not match that declared in the SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">Within the framework of activities to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax administrations have access to registers of government bodies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Register, Business Register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Administration and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Given the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (in particular Customs) and the tax administrations of 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups on development, neither Customs nor federal tax administrations share a fully consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At Customs level, ST I 2 ("KUSS" - Special VAT Audits and Tax Investigations Coordination) collects the findings of the tax fraud check in a specific database called the AACC.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, introduced a new database called ZAUBER for the transfer of the names of tax fraudsters "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">KUSS experience is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">In addition, several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with RMS-related responsibilities and powers.</seg>
<seg id="549">A formal check of the composition of VAT ID of other Member States in SH filed by German payers is introduced at customs level.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal check is carried out prior to the provision of SH data to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The validity of VAT IDs specified in the SH is verified on the basis of the O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT IDs, see. also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">In addition, the RMS on CUSTOMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics that typically feature in so-called carousel trading operations in order to identify potential "missing traders."</seg>
<seg id="553">The tax authorities of the Federal States are instructed to prepare these control reports and, in some cases, to report on the results of their findings to the Customs Authority.</seg>
<seg id="554">The findings of the BRH audit confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case (instead of solely targeting the company's turnover) is to be sufficiently likely.</seg>
<seg id="555">The BRH therefore proposed that the MF should take account of different characteristics in the preparation of the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should also cover other factors, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour (morale), branch (economic activities) or shareholder structure.</seg>
<seg id="557">The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the Federal States and focuses on the processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">For example, RMS generates a list of those payers who have reported intracommunity supplies in their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the Customs to monitor the full administration of SH.</seg>
<seg id="560">In addition, this type of RMS compares intracommunity acquisitions reported in the payer's annual VAT return with VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the Länder seek to avoid comparing quarterly data, since such comparisons would reveal too much non-conforming data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">- the different duration of the intracommunity transaction, in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand, and of the beneficiary on the other;</seg>
<seg id="563">- different accounting for sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting on tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing VAT return and VIES data, many Federal States have introduced elements of RMS based on VAT return data and certain other facts (such as the structure of the company name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer's payment behaviour/morality).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria has introduced a RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to programme their own rules for the allocation of potential perpetrators of tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when tax authorities process monthly VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="567">The competent tax authority therefore receives the recommendation created by the RMS before the VAT is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">As this RMS is unable to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules on the basis of feedback from the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="569">The Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Administrative District has programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="570">On the basis of these data, the RMS is able to determine the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The RMS produces once a month a list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">The competent tax authorities shall use this list as a basis for decisions on the audit of the proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After carrying out the audit, auditors must report their findings in order for the results of the list to be reflected in the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="574">The North Rhine-Westphalia Administrative Area uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rules-based fuzzy system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on the large number of data assessed for VAT returns and some other facts, this neural-fuzzy system or system of collecting potentially useful information (the data-mining system) calculates the probability that a particular taxpayer has committed tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It then compiles a monthly list of potential perpetrators of fraud.</seg>
<seg id="577">The local tax authorities shall use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for inspection and shall notify the findings of the inspection to the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of one of the three RMS in the other Länder is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="579">Given that none of the three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although the specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">As well as different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU country has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of the EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - is not a national but rather a European problem.</seg>
<seg id="586">Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in more than one State.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">The loss of VAT caused by fraud in the EU may not affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">There should therefore be a European exchange and debate on RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected control findings when verifying business transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">The SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information on selected business transactions, which were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two audit institutions jointly examined the execution of several commercial transactions for which there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way the payers from both countries reported these transactions in their VAT and SH tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In 43 cases, the SAO examined the values of intracommunity transactions with Germany, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH, on the basis of BRH warnings.</seg>
<seg id="597">At the request of the SAO, BRH examined 23 cases involving commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the Customs.</seg>
<seg id="599">The examination of the selected cases revealed, inter alia, that different marketing authorisation methods in EU Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to data in VIES, the Czech payer was to be acquired in III. quarter 2004 from a German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.</seg>
<seg id="602">As the Czech taxpayer declared the acquisition of goods only equivalent to EUR 29,869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to examine the value of the goods delivered.</seg>
<seg id="603">In reply to the JHA received from Germany, the German party stated that in the II. in 2004, the German payer supplied the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 27 381, in III. quarters of EUR 31,997 and IV. EUR 10 276 in the 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="604">The reply also showed that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28 September 2004, but the German Customs Office retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate of validity from 1 May 2004, following an additional application by the German payer for a VAT ID certificate.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German payer carried out the repair of SH.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, the Czech payer was involved in the acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="607">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer, following an investigation by the tax administrator, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States while claiming the deduction of VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, from these additional VAT returns, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine whether the values of supplies from the aforementioned German supplier were included.</seg>
<seg id="609">As requested by the SAO, BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, because he did not apply for VAT ID when registering, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within the CFN.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although in Germany it is usually not possible to assign VAT ID to the payer retroactively, in this case the German tax officer retroactively assigned VAT ID to the aforementioned German payer in 2006 at 1.5.2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German Customs Office assigns VAT ID retroactively if the German businessman has not caused a delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay caused Customs after the payer's request for VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case, Customs assigns VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracommunity supply under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="614">On the contrary, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier to report intracommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="615">Due to these different practices between Member States, the German Customs Office has retroactively allocated VAT ID in this particular case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested that the German taxpayer register for VAT be examined.</seg>
<seg id="618">The VIES indicated the date of registration of the 5.3.2005, stating on the registration certificate of the German payer issued locally by the competent German financial authority the date of the 1.10.2004.</seg>
<seg id="619">In the reply received from Germany, the German party stated that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1.10.2004, but VAT ID had been provided to it in Germany for organisational reasons up to 16.2.2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">By enquiry with the local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT check on the Czech payer for tax period III. quarters 2004 to II. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">This audit revealed that the Czech payer included CZK 9,897 (EUR 314) in the VAT return provided to the German payer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1.10.2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">For tax period III. In the quarter of 2004, the Tax Office charged the taxpayer a VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH found out that the German payer had not received VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when it informed the tax office of its business, which it had started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">In addition, the tax office retrospectively registered it for VAT on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this tax return the payer reported intracommunity acquisitions from the Czech Republic totalling EUR 160 (approximately CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. The Czech taxpayer reported in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="627">The Czech tax administrator found, when verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, that his registration was valid from 11. 11. 2004, i.e. after the delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech payer filed an additional VAT DAP, in which he reported a domestic tax base of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692).</seg>
<seg id="629">The SAO inquired with the local tax office in the Czech Republic that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted an application for the renewal of the procedure in respect of the additional VAT return and provided a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German payer had been tax-led since 1.1.2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">The reply received from Germany indicated that the VAT ID had been allocated to the German payer only 11.11.2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the request for retrial.</seg>
<seg id="633">BRH found that in this case it was not an intracommunity acquisition of goods because the German payer acquired VAT ID up to 11.11.2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German beneficiary declared the acquisition as an intracommunity acquisition and declared VAT on the acquisition when it claimed the refund of the input tax in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">However, since there would be no change in the value of VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in its VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">In addition, BRH found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in the JHA, had been changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in I. the quarter 2005 EUR 22,686 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="640">By enquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that this administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, verifying that the delivery of the goods had taken place and that the Czech payer had billed and paid the invoice for the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech payer did not acknowledge the acquisition of goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intracommunitary transactions from 21.4.2005, i.e. to the delivery to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="643">At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the certificate of registration to the German payer so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech Tax Office assessed the transaction as an acquisition of goods from a non-payer in Germany. The Czech taxpayer did not receive any additional tax from the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">BRH found that, under German law, a payer supplying goods to other Member States may not have VAT ID allocated in order to exempt intracommunity supplies from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have at his disposal the VAT ID of the purchaser from another Member State and be able to demonstrate the transport of the goods to another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">According to the German VAT Act it was therefore an intracommunitary transaction and VAT should be charged in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="648">In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German Customs refuses to reply to Ryanair concerning intracommunity transactions worth less than EUR 15,000: 5.</seg>
<seg id="650">Czech payer according to data from VIES in III. acquire EUR 12 561 worth of goods from the German payer in 2004 quarter.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator performed a tax check on the tax entity for this tax period.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the context of international administrative cooperation, he requested the German tax administration to verify the delivery of these goods through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claimed that he never traded with the said German company and his accounts did not include the acquisition of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the requirement to provide evidence - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - on the grounds that turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory justification was given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain the means of proof for determining the tax on acquired goods, it terminated the tax check without finding and the tax liability remained in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">As requested by the SAO, BRH found that the German payer acted as a "fiscal representative" (Section 22 a - e UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German payer reported these deliveries in his annual VAT return and in SH.</seg>
<seg id="658">He was recognised as entitled to the exemption of supply.</seg>
<seg id="659">Based on the BRH notice, the German Tax Office will send to the Czech Republic the supporting documents required for determining the tax on goods acquired in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="660">As mentioned in chapter 4.6.1, the responses to the JHA sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month period more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.</seg>
<seg id="661">The SAO examined the fact that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5.10.2005 concerning the verification of the value of the goods delivered for the 4 quarter. 2004</seg>
<seg id="662">The German payer reported in SH for this period of delivery of goods to the Czech payer worth EUR 86 307, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only corresponding to EUR 35 314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In reply to the JHA, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9. 5. 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing, provided for in Art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German Party stated that the application could not be processed as the German firm ceased operations at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">The Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documentation for the tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator applied to the German taxpayer via the SCAC form for a review of the delivery of cars worth EUR 1,265,554 made in III. and IV. the 2004 quarter, which showed signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that no reply was received from the SRN until the time of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="667">The SAO also found out by enquiry with the local tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT return the supply of new means of transport for the German payer worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.</seg>
<seg id="669">On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH found that the German CCP had not, for technical reasons, forwarded the abovementioned RU to the locally competent financial authority for examination.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following the warning of BRH, a check was carried out in Germany by a German purchaser which found that the acquisition of all cars was properly taxed and that the relevant cars were sold to another payer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to data from VIES, the Czech payer was to acquire in IV. quarter 2004 from a German passenger car payer worth EUR 48,500.</seg>
<seg id="672">The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="673">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">Tax returns were not filed by the Czech taxpayer even after the tax administration's calls. The tax office charged VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2.6.2005, CLO drew attention to the abovementioned delivery from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="676">As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the JOI to Germany concerning the above delivery.</seg>
<seg id="677">As the reply to the SAO was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange until the end of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="678">The Tax Office cancelled VAT registration to the Czech payer on the date of 23.8.2005 due to non-compliance with the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the RU because the audits carried out by the tax authorities on payers were not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH control:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, the Czech tax administrator applied to the German taxpayer via the SCAC form for verification of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16,991, made in III. the 2004 quarter showing signs of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In reply to the JHA, the German tax administrator stated that it had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for delivery worth EUR 16 335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH found that the check carried out by the German Financial Office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German purchaser declared the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10. In 2005 the Czech tax administrator requested a review of the delivery of cars to a German payer totalling EUR 198 167 made in IV. quarters 2004 and I. the 2005 quarter showing the hallmarks of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="686">The German tax administration sent a partial reply to ŽOI to the Czech Republic in which it confirmed the acquisition of certain cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.</seg>
<seg id="687">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that the Czech supplier had carried out several local inquiries in order to verify the excess VAT deductions, in which it did not identify their unauthorised drawdown.</seg>
<seg id="689">BRH found that the German payer had declared the acquisition of goods from other Member States totalling EUR 579 114 in that period in his VAT returns and that the check carried out by the German Financial Office on the purchaser from Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intracommunity value of the goods indicated by the recipient in the tax return and the values indicated by the supplier in his SH.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that the most common reasons for the differences were not the time shift or the indication of the incorrect value of intracommunity delivery of goods in SH:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">Czech payer had in I. According to VIES data, the 2005 quarter was acquired from a German payer with a value of EUR 35,716, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not operate at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax administrator asked the international information exchange to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="695">According to the German tax administration, the reply received from Germany indicated that the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the notified address and that the goods were taken over by the contracted carrier.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only delivered goods worth EUR 21 659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech payer sent the German payer a false receipt of payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="698">After discovering the fraudulent conduct by the Czech purchaser, the German payer managed to recover the supplied material with the help of other Czech customers, except for one item worth EUR 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">By enquiry with the local tax office in the Czech Republic, the SAO found out that the tax administrator provided the Czech taxpayer with VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of the SAO's request, BRH confirmed that the German supplier had declared the delivery of goods to the Czech payer only for a value of EUR 7,916 after the corrections.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected value of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.</seg>
<seg id="702">Thus its SH contained the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested by means of the SCAC form to verify the supply of goods and services carried out in III. quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver to the German payer a total value of EUR 396 126 and provide services worth EUR 11 885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation to verify this delivery with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="707">In reply to the JHA, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer supplied the German payer with a production line including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">Individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic entered the EU and after 1. 5. 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In III. In 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German payer took the invoices but did not recognise them and did not pay.</seg>
<seg id="712">The SAO also found that all invoices are properly registered in the Czech payer's accounts by enquiry with the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="713">In VAT returns for III. The 2005 quarter shows only the amounts documented by the Czech payer which relate to post- 1.5.2004 invoicing.</seg>
<seg id="714">BRH found that on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction concerned the delivery of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including assembly services.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this particular case, the place of work is where the production line was installed.</seg>
<seg id="716">According to the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the supplied service is obliged to pay VAT.</seg>
<seg id="717">At the same time, the recipient may claim a VAT deduction from the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no change in the value of VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to data from VIES, Czech payer A had acquired a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to examine this delivery.</seg>
<seg id="721">In reply to the JHA, the German party stated that already in 2004 the German payer C supplied the Czech payer B, which was to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational branch of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="723">Further, the reply to the request for information showed that the German payer C sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="724">This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational arm of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="725">As the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By enquiry with the tax administrator of the local payer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, the German payer C delivered in III. quarter 2004 to Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027.</seg>
<seg id="727">Payer B denied the acquisition of the goods. The local Czech tax administrator sent the Company to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.</seg>
<seg id="729">A further investigation by Payer B revealed that the Czech tax administrator did not find a machine worth EUR 88 027 in Payer B's accounting and that it could be a machine of the same type as was supplied by the organizational component of the German Payer C to Czech Payer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO also found that the Czech tax administrator of the local payer A carried out a local investigation with this payer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had at its disposal the invoice of the German payer C of 7.2.2005, on which payer A was listed as the customer of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, where the subject of leasing was a machine of the same type.</seg>
<seg id="734">The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place 9.2.2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.</seg>
<seg id="735">The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech Tax Office to determine the tax liability of payer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">BRH found that the German payer C did not deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">It was therefore not an intracommunitary supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not grant exemption from VAT to the German taxpayer C and corrected the data in its tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">German payer D supplied the machine to Czech payer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C indicated in its SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not examined during the tax check carried out by the German Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above commercial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">The SAO found that the Czech tax administration received a request for information from the German tax administrator requesting verification of intracommunity supplies from the German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this was a pretentious intracommunity supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">It was further stated in the JHA that the German payer had not undertaken any active business since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="749">According to the Czech Company Executive, the above case appeared to be a German payer's claim against the German tax administration, which was applied by the Czech payer as a partner of a German company with the German Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator does not currently have any information that the German tax administration would address the issue related to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">According to the available information it was not the delivery of goods, yet the stated value is still included in the VIES system as an intracommunitary delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not show intracommunity acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also section 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to VIES data, the German payer supplied in III. quarters 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the Czech payer of goods totalling EUR 33 205. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="754">IRING segmentISintent  EU blank</seg>
<seg id="755">As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested verification of the delivery of goods from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="756">In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German payer sent part of the goods to the Czech payer's address, the remaining goods were collected personally by the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="757">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer filed additional VAT returns for these periods before receiving a reply to the JHA.</seg>
<seg id="758">Despite this submission, differences in acquisition values were not resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax check be carried out on the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The check has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. The German payer supplied according to the data in VIES in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46,854.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, the Czech payer granted intracommunity acquisitions only equivalent to EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="762">The Czech tax administrator requested verification as part of the international exchange of information on the value of deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="763">The reply to the JHA, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total declared delivery value of EUR 31 999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="764">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that after receiving a reply from the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech accountant and agreed to discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for III with the owner of the company after examining these invoices. quarter 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would continue to proceed in such a way as to comply with the deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">German payer had in IV. supply the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 11,600 in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged partner of the German payer had set up more fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">The Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of goods to the Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="771">According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were further sold during 2005 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech payer submitted documents on the sale of goods for January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not grant or pay tax on the sale of the goods in the Czech Republic or in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in reply to the JHA.</seg>
<seg id="775">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for IV based on the investigations carried out. the 2004 quarter, in which he included the value of the acquisition of goods, inter alia, from the German payer, while claiming the right of deduction for the acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">VAT on the sale of goods in Germany did not appear in the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after the local investigation without change.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, in this case it was not the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="779">The Czech tax administrator therefore carried out an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">BRH found that the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer immediately after accepting the reply to the JHA stating that the goods had not left Germany and claimed VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="781">In addition, the competent tax authority has sent a notice to the tax office of the actual consignee to ensure that the resale of these goods is correctly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases, payers reported intracommunity transactions which were unlikely to have actually taken place:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The application was accompanied by a copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech taxpayer for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="786">A copy of the passport of the person who was said to have carried out the transport of that car was also included.</seg>
<seg id="787">An investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that the passport was stolen, the person in it did not bring any vehicle to the Czech Republic and denied any contacts with the German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Czech tax administrator never issued a VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German party.</seg>
<seg id="789">This information was provided by the Czech tax administrator in reply to the JOI together with the information that it could not confirm the acquisition of the goods - the car in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company executive was non-contact.</seg>
<seg id="791">The Czech tax administrator charged the Czech taxpayer a tax liability of CZK 0 for the February 2005 tax period.</seg>
<seg id="792">Further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question was sold to another Czech entity, which bought it through an advertisement on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that the local German tax administrator, on the basis of the Czech reply to the JHA, would not recognise the German payer as entitled to exemption from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During the inspection, the German tax office was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3000 between the value of the goods acquired declared in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was said that the Czech payer should deliver during IV. quarters 2004 to I. the 2005 quarter to the German payer of goods worth EUR 89 424.</seg>
<seg id="796">Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested verification of the supplies and their reimbursement in the context of the international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Czech tax administrator stated in reply to ŽOI that the only executive of the Czech company was removed from the Commercial Register on 8. 7. 2005 and the new executive was not registered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods appears to have been related to a partner of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech payer filed both VAT and SH tax returns, which were signed by an unauthorized person - the company's partner - after the executive was deleted from the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer confirmed to the tax administrator that the partner of the company paid the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR was deposited into the company's account.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash receipts were not issued.</seg>
<seg id="802">The SAO in the Czech Republic discovered by inquiry with the local tax office that the tax administrator recognised the Czech taxpayer as IV. the quarter 2004 entitled to VAT exemption on delivery of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for I. quarter 2005 of CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548).</seg>
<seg id="803">BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the tax return of the German purchaser because the German judge confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the earlier check did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to recover the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to data in VIES, a German payer acquired EUR 4,251,196 of goods from the Czech Republic in 2005 after acquiring EUR 43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neither in the 2004 tax return nor in the 2005 tax return did the German payer declare intracommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="807">Moreover, it did not declare adequate deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="808">As a result of these differences, the German tax office dispatched the JORs concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">For these two quarters, the Czech supplier reported intracommunity deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6.9.2006, the Company received a request from the German Party to verify whether the Czech payer had received the declared intracommunity supplies.</seg>
<seg id="811">In reply to this JOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no executive.</seg>
<seg id="812">According to materials provided by the SAO to the competent tax administrator, on 30 March 2006 a protocol was drawn up with the Czech payer's manager to initiate VAT control for IV. quarter 2004 and January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The taxpayer was also invited by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above mentioned periods, but did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the sole executive of the Czech payer was terminated as of 16.5.2006. The new executive was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has stopped filing VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of the audit of the SAO in cooperation with the BRH, he also examined several cases of intracommunity supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of prior exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">Information on the cases examined was transmitted by the two supreme audit institutions through the Customs of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. The Czech company (eCR), which is not a resident in Germany, has informed the competent tax authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to make a taxable transaction in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">As a result of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005 but has not received a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">(ECR) has accepted an order from a Danish businessman (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the supply of these wind farms by name, on the risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">Due to lack of own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following diagram shows the contractual relationship and mode of transport of wind farms:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation, the location of these transactions must be determined according to the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">- A Danish businessman (eDK) sent wind farms for assembly under his name, to his own risk and his account in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Since the assembly of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">- Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish businessman (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the payee is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination is different from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">This supply is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted the input tax in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transport.</seg>
<seg id="830">Transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">- The supply of wind power plants that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="832">- The supply of other wind farms which are produced in Germany took place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) made both intracommunity delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracommunity delivery from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not declare any intracommunity acquisition or submit SH to German Customs in its tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="835">Thus, it is possible that the Czech company reported all intracommunitary deliveries uniformly as intracommunitary deliveries from the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that (eCR) did not declare any intracommunity supply to Austria, but intracommunity delivery to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">A review of the taxation of intracommunity acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no indication of tax fraud or evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH examined the transactions in order to highlight the differences between tax returns and VIES data caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The audited cases also demonstrate that changes in legislation need time for the application of new legislation by both payers and tax authorities:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. SH for II. up to IV. In 2004 quarter, the Czech payer reported intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totalling CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).</seg>
<seg id="841">During the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intracommunity delivery to another German payer totalling CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).</seg>
<seg id="842">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech payers reported the abovementioned deliveries in SH in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">Further examination of the above-mentioned transactions, the SAO auditing group found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the legal arrangements for the supply and acquisition of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="845">While in the Czech Republic the payers reported electricity supply in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intracommunitary supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intracommunitary acquisition, but a taxable transaction with the place of execution in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">The difference in statutory regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1. 1. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. During the examination of selected intracommunity transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer reported intracommunity deliveries to the German payer totalling CZK 240 411 163 in SH for Q1-4 2005. (EUR 8,071,823) and another Czech payer reported intracommunity delivery to the German payer totalling CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050) in SH over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="848">According to the information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="849">According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1.1.2005 in the case of electricity supply, the place of supply is the place where the purchaser has his registered office, place of business or has an establishment for which the goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, Czech payers should not have reported the supply of electricity to SH in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">As both payers reported intracommunitary electricity supply in SH, the VIES data was distorted by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">Cooperation met the objectives of BRH and SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAIs acquired a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and showed that VAT governance legislation differs.</seg>
<seg id="856">Suspicious cases of intracommunity transactions were detected during parallel checks.</seg>
<seg id="857">It makes sense to examine some of them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs produced recommendations on the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="859">Monitoring of these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="860">New experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of subsequent VAT administration checks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise control between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="3">The submitted joint report informs on the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Czech Audit Office of the Republic aimed at the administration of excise duties in the period following the entry of both countries into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was carried out on the basis of a contract for cooperation in control activities concluded in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of parallel controls was selected in view of the fundamental change in the system of excise duty collection which took place in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to allow the circulation of non-taxed goods until the date of delivery for final consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8">In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows for the movement of goods under tax supervision under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system places great demands on tax administrations and envisages close synergies between Member States' competent administrations in the fight against tax fraud in this area.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise controls for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Control number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject: (Czech Republic) Administration of Excise Duties (SR) Procedure of Columns</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (SAO-CR) and the Czech Audit Office of the Republic (SAO SR) concluded the "Surveillance Cooperation Agreement" on 8 February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the contract was cooperation in parallel inspections of the "Excise Tax Administration," included in the SAO-Czech Audit Plan for 2005 under No. 05/34, and "Control of the Columns Procedure for Collective Taxes," included in the SAO SR Control Plan for 2006 under No. 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel checks were coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted of exchanging information that could not be obtained by the Contracting Parties when controlling the administration of excise duties in the territory of their State and of producing a joint final report on the outcome of the checks within the meaning of the European Implementing Directives for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards - Directive No 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Czech Republic, the control (hereinafter referred to as "the Czech Republic") was carried out by groups controlling from the state budget department and from the territorial unions of central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, southern Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia between 7 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">27 controllers were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="20">The audited persons were the Directorate-General of Customs (hereinafter referred to as the "GRC") and 11 financial offices.</seg>
<seg id="21">Within the GŘC 12 selected customs offices were checked out of a total of 54.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inspection in the Slovak Republic (hereinafter "SR") was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 in the period from 13 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">8 controllers were involved in the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="24">The aim of the parallel checks was to examine customs procedures for the administration of excise duties and compliance with relevant legislation in both countries and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">International cooperation was focused on the practice of tax administrators in supervising the transport of excise goods, in particular on the registration of initiated and terminated transactions under suspension of tax, and on the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise administrators of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="26">2. Administration of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="27">The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by the financial authorities until 31 December 2003.</seg>
<seg id="28">As of 1 January 2004, this agenda had been taken over by the customs authorities, which had so far only levied excise duty on imports.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="30">The income of the state budget from excise duties in the Czech Republic totalled CZK 82.8 billion in 2004 and excise taxes accounted for 19.5% of the state budget revenue from taxes and charges amounting to CZK 424.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2005, the income of the state budget from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the share of the state budget revenue from taxes and charges amounting to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.</seg>

<seg id="33">The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The administration of all excise duties in the SR shall be carried out by the customs authorities from 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, the administration of which they have been administering since 1 January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the meantime, tax authorities administered excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="36">Excise duty in SR is subject to mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="37">The state budget revenue from excise duties in Slovakia totalled SK 43.4 billion in 2004 and excise taxes accounted for 209.5 billion in total tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2005, the revenue of the state budget from excise duties was Sk 50 billion and the total tax revenue of Sk 222,6 billion was Sk 22,5%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Chart 1 - Comparison of Czech state budget revenues from taxes and taxes and tax revenues of SR state budget with excise revenue</seg>
<seg id="40">The legislation in both countries relies on European Union rules governing this area, in particular: - Council Directive 92/12/EHS on the general arrangements, possession, movement and monitoring of excise products ("Directive 92/12/EEC"), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as "Regulation No 2073/2004"), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the accompanying official document for the transport of excise products under suspension of excise duty ("Regulation No 2719/92"), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92 on a simplified accompanying document for the movement within the Community of excise products released for domestic consumption in the Member State of dispatch ("Regulation No 3649/92").</seg>
<seg id="41">The basic legislation regulating excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No. 353/2003 Coll., on excise taxes, as amended, (hereinafter "Act No. 353/2003 Coll.") effective from 1 January 2004.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the administration of excise duties in SR, the customs authorities are, inter alia, bound by the following generally binding legislation: - Act No 98/2004 Z. z. on the minimum tax applicable to mineraloleja as last amended (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 98/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council"). z.

<seg id="44">The conditions for the movement of excise goods under suspension are governed by Directive 92/12/EHS in Title III - Movement of goods Art. 15 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to those provisions, transport of such goods may be carried out only by an authorised warehousekeeper, which means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to produce, process, store, receive and dispatch excise products.</seg>
<seg id="46">The beneficiary in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or economic operator without the status of authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not store or dispatch such products under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="47">The authorised warehousekeeper is a tax warehouse operator in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic; the economic operator is an authorised beneficiary for repeated or one-off receipt of excise products.</seg>
<seg id="48">Under the Directive, the movement of excise products under suspension is only possible with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document shall be drawn up by the consignor in four copies before the start of transport unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch require further copies.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure for the initiation and termination of transport of goods under suspension between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="51">Transport from the Czech Republic</seg>

<seg id="67">Transport from SR</seg>
<seg id="68">Until 31 December 2005, the procedure for the transport of alcohol and tobacco products from the SR to another Member State of the European Union was adapted as follows:</seg>
<seg id="69">According to the provisions of section 26 para. 4 of Law No 105/2004 Z. z.</seg>
<seg id="70">"From the tax warehouse to the tax warehouse to the beneficiary of the tax warehouse, the sender" (the supplier ") shall be obliged to send an electronic fax machine to the competent authority in order to send a copy of the relevant document electronically to Colní split Poprad; it is compulsory to send to the columnist within three days from the date of the commencement.

"</seg>
<seg id="73">In the case of the transport of other excise products (mineral oil, wine and beer) between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 ("the audited period"), the tax entity was not obliged to notify the Poprad Customs Office or the competent Customs Office of the start of transport under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax administrator did not learn about the transport of these products until a local investigation or a tax check on the accompanying documents and accounting documents of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="75">The sender in the SR is obliged to draw up the accompanying document in four copies before the start of transport.</seg>

<seg id="89">2.3 Records of initiated and terminated debts held by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="90">A single electronic system is not set up to monitor the transport of goods under suspension between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="91">Decision 1152/2003/ES of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 establishing an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products requires the Member States and the European Commission to establish an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) from 1 July 2009 to enable excise administrators in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents which are currently used only in paper form and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under suspension and to ensuring a more efficient control of the movement of untaxed products across all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">Member States' national databases will be part of this system.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport commenced and terminated in the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Register of selected products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").</seg>
<seg id="95">All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have online access to the system.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the case of transfers carried out only in the territory of the Czech Republic, tax administrations may obtain information about the start or termination of transport immediately after registration of the accompanying document by the customs office into the EVV.</seg>
<seg id="97">The customs office shall release the VAT on the transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration by the customs office of the relevant recipient.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in the SR use a database based on SysNed application software, which ensures automation of their activities in the administration of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">By registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in SysNed application software, this information is automatically transferred to the "System for Exchange of Excise Data" (SEED) database.</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO-Czech Republic and representatives of the SAO SR, which discussed the concrete process of cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties, took place in January 2006.</seg>
<seg id="102">The two parties became acquainted with the excise legislation and the organisation of excise tax administration in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in authorizing, or starting and ending the transport of excise products under suspension and exchange of information between excise administrators of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">At the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties: - compile overall data on the quantity of excise products transported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started during the audited period, - compare data on mineral oil transport - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - code of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 under the suspension procedure initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in SR and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">During the checks, the screened periods were extended to include the months October and November 2005 and, during those months, the transport of tobacco products under suspension was subject to inspection.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of excise products transported under suspension between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of records of goods under suspension</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO-CR transmitted to the Slovak side a database of debits completed in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5,876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 were mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO SR forwarded to the Czech side a database of transfers completed in SR which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 items concerned mineral oil, 2,066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO-CR compared the data on transport listed in the records initiated in the Czech Republic with data on terminated transport registered in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the comparison are shown in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="112">The SAO-CR compared transport data in November 2004 and September 2005 with a database of the Slovak customs administration, which the SAO SR transmitted to it at the beginning of the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain data enabling reliable reconciliation of individual transport, and therefore only 63% of initiated operations were allocated.</seg>
<seg id="114">Each transport was assigned according to multiple data, e.g. sender, consignee, date of transport, quantity of shipped products.</seg>
<seg id="115">In October and November 2005, the SAO-CR compared the transport services started in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which included all data according to the accompanying documents on the basis of which 93% of the initiated transactions were unequivocally allocated.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The quantity of alcohol was in most cases indicated in litres but could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol on the basis of the database of that percentage of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">The quantity of tobacco products was indicated in pieces, in thousands and kilograms by type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">In the Czech Republic, where the termination could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or where the number of products transported did not match, the accompanying documents were checked.</seg>
<seg id="120">Documents accompanying 487 transports of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were inspected.</seg>
<seg id="121">The examination of these documents was carried out at the customs offices at which the SAO-Czech Republic carried out the inspection.</seg>
<seg id="122">For the cases authorised by the other customs authorities, the accompanying documents were requested by the DG.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech party asked the Slovak party to verify the implementation of 141 transfers, to which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide confirmed copies No. 3 of the accompanying document, or the quantity of products listed on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, data on transport registered in the Slovak database were transmitted to the Slovak party, which was not contained in the Czech Customs database.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR searched 95 million in the database of the Slovak Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="126">He requested that the remaining 46 months be verified by the local competent customs authorities, which demonstrated their termination by copies of the accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="127">The Slovak party forwarded to the Czech side copies of accompanying documents on the basis of which transport was identified in the Czech database, except for those carried out by two Czech tax entities which were not found in the Czech database.</seg>
<seg id="128">The following cases were examined:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 spirits were registered in the Slovak database in a total quantity of 276,7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax body in 2004 and 20 million spirits in a total quantity of 404,66 litres of alcohol implemented in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO-CR found that these were transports of taxed products, for which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="131">The sender informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of transport. Transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents for the transport of products under suspension;</seg>
<seg id="132">- a total of 94 million mineral oils were registered in the Slovak database, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, totalling 173 000 litres realised by the Czech taxpayer between September 2004 and December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005 the tax entity carried out the transport of 102 thousand litres of untaxed mineral oils without proper authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="134">The tax entity held a special authorisation to receive and use exempt products on the basis of which it could supply non-taxable products only to the holder of the same authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="135">He did not notify the customs office in the Czech Republic of the initiation of the procedure and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1,207,680 for the transported products.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the period July 2005 to December 2005, the tax entity transported 71 thousand litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of SR. Even in these cases, it failed to comply with the legal obligation by not notifying the customs office of initiation of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="137">The consignor in the Czech Republic may initiate the transport of products for free tax circulation in the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State without the consent of the customs office, but is obliged to inform the customs office in writing prior to the start of transport.</seg>
<seg id="138">A tax entity taking products into free circulation in another Member State is obliged to report the quantities and ensure the tax before withdrawing them.</seg>
<seg id="139">Products may only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation also permits the use of an accompanying document for transport under suspension, but it must be clearly indicated that it is a "simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax control (excise products)."</seg>
<seg id="141">The same legislation on transport and admission to free circulation of products in another Member State applies in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="142">In these cases, the tax entities transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under the suspension scheme, the 3rd and 4th of which the recipient submitted to the tax administration in SR for verification.</seg>
<seg id="143">The customs authorities in the SR registered these transport operations in the database under the suspension procedure, since the accompanying documents did not indicate that they were a simplified accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the database of the Czech customs administration with the database of the Slovak customs administration and found:</seg>
<seg id="145">- in the databases, the quantities of products transported were presented inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil in litres, hectolitres or kilograms; the alcohol is presented in litres or litres of alcohol making it more difficult to compare the quantities of goods transported,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the quantity of spirit transported in the invoices did not match the quantity recorded in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all related invoices were included in the databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- in the database of the Slovak customs administration, two transport of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic was registered in November 2004 in a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol, which were not found in the database of the Czech customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak side submitted copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="151">Until 30 June 2005, the conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the management of excise duties were regulated by Council Directive 77/799/EHS on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxes, certain excise duties and insurance premiums.</seg>
<seg id="152">Regulation No 2073/2004, laying down rules and procedures allowing the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange the information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties, entered into force on 1 July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office to ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise duty management and shall be responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the Czech Republic, the report "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as "ELO CR") was set up at the GŘC to ensure the exchange of information in the field of excise taxes between Member States of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="155">With effect from 1 May 2004, the ELO Office at Poprad carried out security tasks related to the management of systems for controlling the movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the SR.</seg>
<seg id="156">With effect from 1 July 2005, ELO's tasks shall be carried out by the Department of ELO (headquartered in Poprada) of the Department of Excise Duties of the Customs Directorate of SR (hereinafter referred to as "ELO SR").</seg>
<seg id="157">In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 (1) of the Treaty. 3 Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office shall be responsible, in particular, for - the exchange of data kept in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of movements of excise goods dispatched to other Member States or received from them by the Movement Verification System (</seg>
<seg id="158">The content, scope and functionality of the SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are modified in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - a system for the exchange of information on tax entities trading in excise goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">The system is made up of national excise tax registers and allows tax administrations in the territory of the European Union to determine whether excise products are traded by a person entitled to do so.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States only for excise purposes.</seg>
<seg id="162">The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information stored in that database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with Section 41 of Law No 98/2004 Z. z., with Section 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Z. z., with Section 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Z. z. and with Section 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised beneficiaries and tax warehouses - the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="164">Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or authorised recipient in SysNed application software, which is automatically connected to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, authorised beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, the associated data are automatically transferred to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the Slovak Customs Administration and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic was usually carried out once a month, exceptionally more than once a month during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="167">SR Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">The data are transferred to the SEED database in the Czech Republic from the national register, in which all persons entitled to dispose of excise products and issued authorisations to dispose of such products are registered.</seg>
<seg id="169">Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="170">Requests from customs authorities to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the transport of risky shipments is announced.</seg>
<seg id="172">The transport of certain excise products in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission Regulation and the transport assessed as risky by the tax administration are considered to be a risk consignment.</seg>
<seg id="173">The exchange of information is carried out in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- information - sent when the limits set are exceeded,</seg>
<seg id="175">- warning message - sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="176">When assessing the degree of risk of a consignment, ELO SR shall use the SEED database for sending the warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="177">If the data in the SEED database does not match the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the consignee of the goods or the registered office of the consignee does not match), ELO SR shall draw up a warning message to the ELO of the Member State of receipt of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="178">When drawing up the reports, ELO shall be governed by the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which shall, inter alia, determine the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measure for the preparation of information and warning reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the audited period ELO SR sent one warning message to ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, information on initiated transport of products in quantities exceeding specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving transport.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic assesses the shipment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it will prepare a so-called warning message, which it will send to the relevant Member State via the ELO of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005 ELO CR sent two warning messages to ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">The MVS - the system for controlling the movement of goods - enables the MVS, through requests, to control the individual transport of excise products as well as the control of the specified route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">The exchange of information shall take place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">The system shall be used in particular in cases where the consignor takes possession of a certified copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requests, for example, a refund of excise duty and where the particulars contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period, ELO SR sent 33 requests to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="187">ELO CR sent ELO SR 25 requests to MVS.</seg>
<seg id="188">The customs authorities in the Czech Republic most frequently examined the particulars contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantities of products received or dispatched, or whether the consignor of the products mentioned in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of excise products, unless this fact could be verified in the international SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="189">Received by the MVS in both countries, they were referred to the customs offices locally responsible for the recipients or consignors of excise products.</seg>
<seg id="190">The customs authorities examined the requested data and notified the outcome of the investigation via ELO to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. Summary</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation between the SAO-Czech Republic and the SAO SR allowed to compare the basic legislation governing excise duties in both countries, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the initiation and termination of the transport of products under suspension between the two countries, the registration of such transactions and further to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 By comparing the legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, differences were found:</seg>
<seg id="194">a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrations when starting the transport of products under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="195">Transport of products under suspension of tax may be initiated by the tax entity in the Czech Republic only with the approval of the tax administrator, which authorizes the start of transport on condition that the products transported have been provided with a guarantee of the amount of tax attributable to them.</seg>
<seg id="196">The start of the transport of products under suspension in SR is not subject to the authorisation of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, the taxpayer was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the start of transport of alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">He could start shipping mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006, the Slovak Republic gradually adopted amendments to all excise laws under which the consignor of goods under suspension of tax is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office which is locally responsible for the consignor before the start of transport;</seg>
<seg id="200">(b) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy No. 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification at the latest the following working day after the end of the transport.</seg>
<seg id="202">Certified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor no later than the following business day after receipt from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="203">The consignee in the SR is obliged to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3 certified by the tax administrator and the recipient of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">Customs authorities in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of products under suspension.</seg>
<seg id="205">The content and method of keeping this record is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="206">The customs authorities in both countries shall enter in the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="207">There is currently no single electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under suspension between Member States of the European Union, enabling excise administrators in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the transport of goods.</seg>
<seg id="208">According to Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of excise products is foreseen from 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of a contract for cooperation in control activities, the Czech Party has forwarded to the Slovak party a database of products subject to suspension started in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="210">The database contained 5,876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak party handed over to the Czech party a database of products under suspension of tax started in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="212">The database contained 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech party compared the data on the transport listed in the register started in the Czech Republic with the records of the Czech Republic terminated in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak party compared data on the transport of goods under the suspension procedure initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="215">The comparison of data was made more difficult by the fact that the quantities of goods transported were not reported uniformly in the databases.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was not possible to unambiguously assign data on each transport in both registers, a check of the accompanying documents was carried out and no breach of the suspension scheme or cases of tax evasion was detected.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the basis of the knowledge from the parallel controls, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the registers in order to improve the management of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="218">The establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/ES of the European Parliament and of the Council will allow the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under suspension of tax in the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Report on the results of follow-up</seg>
<seg id="3">Introductory word</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxation is generally a key source of public revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It therefore goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should focus their attention on this area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Examples are value added tax fraud ("VAT").</seg>
<seg id="7">In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (the "EU").</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005, participants in the VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Within this cooperation, SAIs can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is a very appropriate area for control cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic ("SAO") and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, "BRH") carried out the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The relevant report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As VAT fraud is not limited to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between the SAIs is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both SAIs therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel follow-up check.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)</seg>
<seg id="18">Control objective:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The aim of the audit action was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) The audit action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="21">The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting control findings were intended to compare with the established best practice (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited period was 2006 to 2008, in the case of factual contexts as well as the period preceding and following, until the end of the check.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions</seg>
<seg id="25">The subsequent inspection of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">During previous parallel checks, suspicious cases of intracommunity transactions were detected.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them requested further clearance.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of the audit findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations on the administration of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up exercise was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspected cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also focused on selected cases of high-risk intracommunity transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables and the implementation of VAT controls on large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When reviewing VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, auditors obtained the following control findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from the previous check</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions for the registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">In previous parallel checks, the comparison of VAT registration systems in both countries revealed differences.</seg>
<seg id="35">As different marketing authorisations cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This recommendation has been presented at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 ("Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003") called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a VAT tax identification number database.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also amended common standards for registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAI expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of this document, agreed by the EU Member States under ECOFIN, no longer contains this issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">Both SAIs regret that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant prevention tool to combat VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly summary reporting</seg>
<seg id="44">In the context of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports, thereby allowing for a more timely examination of intra-community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive No 2008/117/ES amending the 2006/112/ES Directive on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions shortens the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">In Germany, the obligation to submit summary reports on a monthly basis was not introduced within the specified deadline in accordance with applicable EU rules, while in the Czech Republic it was.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany with a view to improving the reliability of VIES data and considering linking the two VAT return schemes and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the recommendations of BRH and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing of successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAIs agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="52">Successful risk management criteria, components and approaches need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="53">If this is not the case, perpetrators of fraudulent activity will be chosen by the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">The check found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this area, the SAO inspected the EUROCANET system, which enables information to be exchanged within the EU, while BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up of selected cases of intracommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="57">During the previous control action, commercial transactions were jointly examined for which there were doubts as to their realisation or irregularities in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or summary reports by the taxpayer from both countries.</seg>
<seg id="58">Both SAIs selected nine cases for follow-up, which included intracommunity movements of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the respective countries have not been concluded by the date of completion of our previous joint control action.</seg>
<seg id="60">The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings in relation to the selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were concluded and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT credits or avoidance of input tax refunds).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Control of selected cases of risky intracommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">High-risk cases of intracommunity transactions carried out by EU payers included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="63">EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risk taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The participation of Member States in this scheme is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is inconvenient for an active participant in a system if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="67">In view of the fact that the German tax administration was not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained as to which suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as risky.</seg>
<seg id="68">The SAO identified cases of normal commercial transactions as well as suspected involvement in carousel business or VAT fraud as part of the audit action.</seg>
<seg id="69">Tax administrators have limited possibilities to control risky transactions, especially with regard to so-called missing traders, whereas mere physical examination of documents can be difficult to prove to the taxpayer any fraudulent conduct.</seg>
<seg id="70">A similar situation for the tax administrator arises when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracommunity carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="71">In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater mutual cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation and to monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany, like some other countries, is reluctant to actively participate in EUROCANET because of the lack of a sufficient legal base.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risky tax payers that have so far proved their worth to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="74">There is a need to communicate and exchange experiences between EU Member States in this area.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council reached political agreement on a proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation lies in the creation of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experience gained so far in the use of EUROCANET should provide the basis for the creation of this new VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States are subject to the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore, the method of processing applications for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.</seg>
<seg id="81">The SAO and the BRH made a comparison of the statistics submitted by both Member States for the years 2006-2008 to the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="82">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="83">The two SAIs consider it useful to renegotiate statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.</seg>
<seg id="84">Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, the SAIs agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It would probably be useful for the Commission to produce an analysis on the basis of more detailed statistics to help Member States to strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery success rates to increase the recovery rate to at least the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAI analysed the legal situation relating to VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter referred to as "VDS") in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">In addition, they collected information from tax authorities in the form of a questionnaire on the areas that SAI considers essential to the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">The responses received clearly show that the situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system that relies on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax checks, balance sheet and profit and loss statements, etc.) to guide the selection of risk-inclined cases.</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">The establishment of a specialised financial office for the management of VDS is planned in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">There is not yet a similar system in Germany, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany has so far concentrated more on the selection of the individual cases in question, in particular on the basis of the VAT return and the summary report.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of this data is based on different risk management components that will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Progress of the control action</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 The Czech Republic Control Action</seg>
<seg id="101">The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Department of State Budget Revenue and Territorial Unions IX. Pilsen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited persons were: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter the "FA"): FA Brno II, FU Brno III, FU Brno IV, FU in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FU in Hodonín, FU in Hradec Králové, FU in Cheb, FU in Jablonec nad Nisou, FU in Karlovy Vary, FU in Králupy nad Vltavou, FU in Kraslice, FU Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FU in Písek, FU in Pilsen, FU for Prague 1, FA for Prague 4, FU for Prague 8, FU in Rakovník, FU in Sokolov, FU in Tábor, FU in High Toll, FU in Zlín and FU in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The audit conclusion of this audit action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Progress of the control action in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Control Department for indirect taxes and by the staff of the designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">Following the selection of a sample of cases, a number of Länder were informed of the mission of the control action.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, audits took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">The tax files of the following tax authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Munich Central Tax Office), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North)</seg>
<seg id="109">In addition, negotiations took place with the financial offices of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-South) and financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The audit findings were reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">In preparation of the parallel control actions, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions was held in September 2008 to discuss and identify the topics of control.</seg>
<seg id="113">Finally, in December 2008, the leaders of the two SAIs signed an agreement on cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the control teams informed each other about the initial results achieved during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed a way forward.</seg>
<seg id="115">The second meeting took place in Prague on 2. - 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The control teams exchanged findings between them and agreed a timetable for drawing up a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">Both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report • examination of selected cases of intracommunity transactions between Czech and German tax payers, which have not been resolved during the previous parallel check • examination of selected cases of intracommunity transactions between Czech and German tax payers, which have been classified as high risk cases • control of tax administration procedures in the area of international assistance in the recovery of VAT claims, • tax control of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">A report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during a workshop in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Check VAT management in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous inspection</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">The conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">On the basis of the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended adjusting the VAT registration conditions and introducing a new rule for cancellation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The modified conditions should make it possible to reduce the risk of possible tax evasion for VAT collection more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="126">In this context, it was found that in some cases the tax authorities did not use the right to cancel VAT registration to payers who did not comply with obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (VAT Act).</seg>
<seg id="127">The Czech Ministry of Finance has not yet proposed an amendment to the provision introducing an obligation for tax administrators to cancel VAT registration on repeated failure to submit a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the "ex offo" tax payer in cases where: (a) the taxpayer has not performed the reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months, (b) the payer fails to fulfil his obligations under this Act, (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.</seg>
<seg id="129">In the previous audit action, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the FA for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration at 31 January of the following calendar year for so-called non-established payers who had no obligation to declare and pay tax during the current calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="130">The FA for Prague 1 often did not cancel the VAT registration for these payers, as the relevant provision provided for insufficient time to cancel the registration.</seg>
<seg id="131">This problem was removed by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established tax payer in the event that the tax payer has not supplied any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with a right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly summary reporting</seg>
<seg id="135">In the context of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Council Directive shortens the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">The obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form is also newly established.</seg>
<seg id="138">The summary report shall be filed by the payer even if the services for which the place of performance is determined in accordance with Section 9 (1) of the Financial Regulation. 1 of the VAT Act, provided to another Member State by a taxable person in another Member State and if he is obliged to declare and pay tax on such services by their recipient.</seg>
<seg id="139">This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/ES amending Directive 2006/112/ES as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports with a view to improving the reliability of data in the VIES system This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech Administration compares data on intracommunity transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech payers automated in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing of successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level</seg>
<seg id="145">Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">The fight against VAT fraud is therefore a priority concern and has received considerable attention in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight is illustrated, inter alia, by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009 in which an external evaluator attempted to establish the difference between the eligible and actually collected VAT levels in the 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as "EU-25") during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">On the basis of the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of loss on non-collected VAT for this period is between EUR 90 billion and EUR 113 billion, while on average 12% of eligible VAT is not collected annually.</seg>
<seg id="149">For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was estimated at 18%.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the context of international cooperation, the previous control action stated that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="151">The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="152">As regards the risk management system, the SAO audited EUROCANET for information exchange in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risk intracommunity transactions carried out by EU tax payers included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and improving the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve cooperation between responsible authorities in a way that allows fraud to be detected in their embryos.</seg>
<seg id="155">This network should later become an important source of information when assessing intra-Community performance risks.</seg>
<seg id="156">The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812, while setting out the basic principles to be followed by the network.</seg>
<seg id="157">The EUROFISC is an already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information by EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and supported by the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report revealed the following:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">The conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The German tax administration established a well-functioning system for registering tax payers, based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance drew the Commission's attention to this system in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">System improvement shall be carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="166">Currently, data from the questionnaire are processed electronically and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission has submitted a proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed work on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="169">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly summary reporting</seg>
<seg id="172">On 8 April 2010, a law was adopted transposing EU directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="173">This Act contains provisions concerning the monthly submission of summary reports on intracommunity supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">Those provisions took effect on 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregated reports in order to improve the reliability of VIES data and to consider linking the two VAT return systems and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group consisting of workers from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance was set up.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group developed a strategy for the automatic comparison of VAT tax returns and summary reports.</seg>
<seg id="179">This strategy has so far been discussed in the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="180">Furthermore, the working group looked at an instrument designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing of successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany participates in this exchange in the framework of the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and, following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the Platform are further divided into subgroups dealing with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • behavioural influences, • evaluation, • updating the Risk Management Guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports on the performance of these sub-groups were published at the beginning of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of conditions for VAT registration and cancellation in different countries has been addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing databases within the EU, including a VAT tax identification number database.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also regulated common minimum standards for registration and deregistration of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issue of registration and cancellation has so far been left to the national legislation of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">Member States have requested further clarification and detailed work on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="194">BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany did not fall.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on that proposal for a Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States must implement national procedures and are only obliged to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of those procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">Both SAIs regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They would therefore like the Commission to make further efforts in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly summary reporting</seg>
<seg id="201">In the context of international cooperation, it was recommended in the previous control action that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports, allowing for a more timely review of intra-community transaction values.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive No 2008/117/ES amending the 2006/112/ES Directive on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion linked to intra-Community transactions shortens the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010 and took effect on 1 July 2010 in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany has not introduced the obligation to submit summary reports monthly according to the specified calendar, whereas the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).</seg>
<seg id="205">Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany with a view to improving the reliability of VIES data and considering linking the two VAT return schemes and summary reports</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the recommendations of BRH and set up a working group to find possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">Work is ongoing so far and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing of successful risk management system criteria, components and approaches at EU level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-inclined traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The SAO has inspected the EUROCANET system used for the exchange of information in the EU (see above). 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this area, BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up of selected cases of intracommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="213">The previous auditing operation jointly examined the execution of commercial transactions for which there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way the payers from both countries reported these transactions in their VAT tax returns or summary statements.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected nine cases involving intracommunitary movements of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for follow-up, the control of which was not completed during the previous joint control action by the tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">The Czech payer acquired goods worth EUR 22,686 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech payer did not acknowledge the acquisition of goods in his VAT return because the German payer did not have VAT ID allocated during that period, but only a tax number for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">On the basis of international administrative cooperation pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator has received information that according to the German VAT law, the taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States need not have VAT ID allocated in order to exempt the intracommunitary supply of goods from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT return on the basis of a check carried out by the Czech tax administrator, in which he declared the acquisition of goods at the same value and claimed the same amount of VAT in this tax return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to acquire goods worth EUR 12,561 from the German payer.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Czech payer denied the acquisition of these goods and did not state in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax administration refused to cooperate on request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence, it terminated the inspection without finding and the tax liability remained at its original level.</seg>
<seg id="225">A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had received two spontaneous information from Germany pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showing that the German payer had invoiced those goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech payer acquired the goods from the Slovak payer and listed them in the regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">The Czech payer was to acquire a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from the German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Czech taxpayer did not grant the acquisition of the goods in question.</seg>
<seg id="230">The tax payer did not submit VAT returns since August 2004. The tax administrator charged VAT of CZK 0 for that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the basis of the information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the taxpayer to submit an additional VAT return, which was not submitted by the payer.</seg>
<seg id="232">A subsequent audit revealed that the tax administrator performed further tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the Czech taxpayer sold the car in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech Tax Administrator issued a statement of payment for the December 2004 tax period, which additionally charged VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and subsequent sales of CZK 295 379.</seg>
<seg id="234">By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was annulled with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of executions of the taxable debtor's liable assets, this arrears appear to be impregnable.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">The Czech payer was to deliver new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany during the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, totalling EUR 198 167.</seg>
<seg id="238">The reply to the request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 indicated that a pending tax and criminal proceeding was taking place against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">During the subsequent inspection, BRH obtained information that after the completion of the tax procedure in Germany, it was demonstrably established that the German taxpayer had been incorporated into fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">Intracommunity acquisitions were taxed at EUR 182,424 (2004) and EUR 369,690 (2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">The SAO subsequently discovered that the Czech payer was involved in carousel business with new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">On the basis of information from the German tax administration concerning the examination of the supply of goods, the Czech tax body started checking VAT for the taxation period April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">On the basis of the audit findings and information obtained as part of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally charged CZK 703 031 of VAT for the period May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for the period June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">In February 2005, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine from a German payer totalling EUR 58 000.</seg>
<seg id="246">This German payer was to deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech B payer in Q3 2004, but B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">A subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that Payer B had acquired a machine from a German company with an organizational unit established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">The Czech taxpayer A did not declare the acquisition of goods from the German payer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">A reply from the German tax administrator to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 indicated that the German payer had not made intracommunity deliveries of the machine worth EUR 58 000 but the supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">By subsequent inspection, BRH found that after a tax check, the intracommunity of the machine was re-qualified for domestic delivery and the VAT exemption was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer was to deliver goods worth EUR 11,600 to the Czech payer.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">The SAO subsequently discovered that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the additional VAT return filed, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was wrongly indicated, including the acquisition of goods of that value.</seg>
<seg id="255">BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and additionally charged VAT of EUR 1 600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Further movement of goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.</seg>
<seg id="257">The German payer's summary report has not yet been corrected as only the payer who submitted the summary report can make corrections to the summary reports in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">The Czech tax administrator charged the Czech taxpayer CZK 0 after the tax procedure for the February 2005 tax period and informed the German tax administrator that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A subsequent audit of the SAO found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administrator sent documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="262">A subsequent inspection by BRH found that the German payer had changed its registered office and that the new local tax administrator had abolished the VAT exemption for the delivery of the car to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the data in the summary report and has lodged an appeal against the tax administration's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to VIES data, the German payer supplied a total value of EUR 33,205 to the Czech taxpayer between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">A subsequent audit of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator attempted to ascertain the reasons for the differences arising from the Czech tax payer's acquisition of goods during the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech tax payer repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the 1 quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the acquired goods totalling CZK 134,273 for the period from Q3 2004 to Q1 2005, as according to the Czech tax administrator, it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for each quarter and therefore the tax administrator accepted additional tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">The German taxpayer delivered EUR 46,854 worth of goods to the Czech payer in the third quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">During the same period, the Czech payer granted intracommunity acquisitions of goods worth only EUR 14 856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made in the context of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of delivery of goods of EUR 31,998, which corresponds to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data provided in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="274">A subsequent audit of the SAO revealed that the Czech payer filed an additional tax return for the taxable period July 2004 until January 2007 following many tax urgencies.</seg>
<seg id="275">In this tax return, the tax payer also claimed the deduction of VAT, leaving the tax liability unchanged for that tax period.</seg>
<seg id="276">The subsequent audit verified that the majority of tax proceedings were completed in selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany and that the tax administrators in both the Czech Republic and Germany took appropriate measures (i.e. additional VAT assessment or avoidance of input tax refund).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Control of selected cases of risk intracommunity transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Audit results in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET may be an important source of information for the detection of risk operators within the Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with the customer data.</seg>
<seg id="281">Starting in the first quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic is sending data on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="282">Within the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="283">These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data from tax administrations from other Member States have been collected in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="285">Given that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, no information could be obtained to help establish whether suppliers with German VAT ID had been assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.</seg>
<seg id="286">The control action revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel or VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="287">Where appropriate, tax administrations have benefited from the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risk transactions when verifying signal information.</seg>
<seg id="290">Tax authorities shall monitor such tax entities on an ongoing basis for their inclusion in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="291">• The tax authorities did not show any deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT in the accounting records submitted, despite finding irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or detecting business relations with suspected or non-contact companies from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• Verifying business transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">The local tax authorities mostly examined the risk tax entities and the risk transactions identified in the EUROCANET signal information.</seg>
<seg id="294">Tax administrators have limited possibilities when examining risky transactions, especially in connection with the screening of so-called missing traders, and it is difficult to prove fraudulent behaviour to the taxpayer only from physical control of documents.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter requirements for VAT registration and more flexible cancellation of registrations would help reduce missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious intra-EU supplies of goods or for the purpose of issuing formally correct tax documents to payers who are unduly receiving input VAT deductions on their basis.</seg>
<seg id="297">In cases where there is suspicion of involvement of tax operators in carousel transactions and other fraud and imports and exports of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater mutual cooperation between customs and financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in transport documentation and in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in EUROCANET was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness in the scheme, which should be removed by setting up a mandatory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Results of the inspection in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">BRH analysed the information available with the Federal Central Tax Office, which contained data from the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="303">These data were a criterion for collecting six files of German tax payers for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany, like some other countries, has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but only receives EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The reasons for this position are set out in the following statement: it is not legally permissible for government (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">There is currently no legal basis for breaching the applicable tax classification rules.</seg>
<seg id="308">In addition, the Government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States under EUROCANET. "17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has carried out analyses of EUROCANET data and has been referring them to the financial authorities of the Länder in accordance with the agreed procedure.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax authorities receive control information on the direct business relationships of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain trade relations with the German trader in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">It is inconvenient for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.</seg>
<seg id="314">As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.</seg>
<seg id="316">Tax administrations in both countries have a number of other tools for detecting fraudulent transactions, but a comprehensive risk management system within the EU is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="317">The EU Council reached political agreement on the proposal for a regulation, the main contribution of which is the establishment of the EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="318">Experience gained from the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the envisaged VAT fraud network.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, cases brought before courts at national and European level show that a debate between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemptions in intracommunity transactions may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">In particular, the following Directives provide a fundamental adjustment to international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive No 76/308/EHS on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/ES amending Directive No 76/308/EHS on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/ES implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EHS on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">In the Czech Republic, Council Directive No. 76/308/EHS was implemented by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following the adoption of Council Directive No. 2001/44/ES, it was necessary to implement this Directive into the Czech legal order while amending the aforementioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="329">In this context, a new Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims, was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="330">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008 is a new regulation in the system of international cooperation for the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Annex to the Regulation sets out new models of applications to be used from the 1.1.2009, a new electronic communication obligation and an obligation for the applicant authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.</seg>
<seg id="332">Guiding principles for providing international cooperation in the recovery of claims:</seg>
<seg id="333">1 reciprocity;</seg>
<seg id="334">(2) assistance shall only be granted on the basis of an application containing the prescribed requirements;</seg>
<seg id="335">(iii) assistance shall not apply to financial claims which are punishable by criminal law in the requested State;</seg>
<seg id="336">In providing international assistance for the recovery of claims, the national law of the State which has been requested for assistance shall be followed;</seg>
<seg id="337">5th foreign receivables do not take precedence in recovery;</seg>
<seg id="338">6 assistance shall be granted only for the recovery of uncontested claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">The 7th principle of exhaustion (the requesting State has, without success, used all applicable options to recover a claim under its legal order).</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines the three forms by which assistance is carried out, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure for sending claims for recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">The local competent tax office shall send the request for information, request for receivables or request for recovery to the Czech Ministry of Finance by electronic means.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance will arrange for the translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it including the annexes and send it to the competent tax administration of the designated state through the CCN/CSI network.</seg>
<seg id="344">There are two essential requirements for recovery: the claim must be more than EUR 1,500 and must not be older than 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="345">If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure for receiving claims for recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">When receiving an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the application as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall communicate to the requesting authority the reasons for rejecting the application and indicate the specific provisions of the directive it invokes.</seg>
<seg id="349">This communication shall be sent no later than three months after the date of confirmation of receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application has all the requirements of the law and should immediately transmit the application through the Financial Directorate to the locally competent tax office for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator, inter alia, ascertains the property of the debtor, e.g. by acquiring records from the Land Registry, checking accounts in banks, verifying the registration of vehicles at the Transport Inspectorate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">After a period of six months from the date on which the receipt of the request was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should communicate to the requesting authority the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">In the case of non-contact tax entities where a claim cannot be recovered, the requesting authority should also be informed thereof.</seg>
<seg id="354">Each amount recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator enforcing foreign receivables may allow payment or payment in instalments if the State which requested the recovery so agrees.</seg>
<seg id="356">During the recovery period, the debtor is subject to interest or penalty payments pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Charges.</seg>
<seg id="357">This interest or penalty belongs to the State which requested the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">In the case of accepted requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not advance applications to the local tax administrations in time, especially in 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was found in the context of international assistance in the recovery of claims also in the case of applications received from Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance failed to comply with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months of the date on which the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="361">This situation has been improving since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistics</seg>
<seg id="363">The Czech Ministry of Finance complies with the provisions of § 13 para. 4 Act No. 191/2004 Coll. it shall process by 15 March each year statistics for the European Commission indicating the number of requests for information, service or recovery, dispatched or received in the previous year, indicating the amount of claims to which applications relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">The European Commission shall, on the basis of supporting documents provided by all EU Member States, prepare a report on the recovery status, which it shall submit to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistics due to an error in the item of recovered receivables in 2008 by EUR 5,250 thousand, indicating the incorrect value of the recovered VAT claim (this was a shift in the decimal point after the conversion of the receivables from Czech crowns to euro value).</seg>
<seg id="366">This error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on mutual assistance, including recovered amounts, can be found in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">Legal authorisation for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from European Communities law, Council Directive No 2008/55/ES of 26 May 2008 (EC Debt Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">In the interests of more accessible formulation and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive No 76/308/EHS of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply inter alia to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Debt Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by Law (EC) on the Collection of State Taxes of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities which are applicable in national jurisdiction and under the EC Administrative Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part Six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) enshrines the legal provisions governing the enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative actions of the tax authorities shall be governed in particular by enforcement instructions and enforcement instructions.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the Länder with regard to the principles of administrative assistance in tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">The general conditions for submitting claims for recovery are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="379">• Legal requirements must be met (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic recovery funds have already been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• Claims subject to recovery requests must be final.</seg>
<seg id="382">• From the issuance of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. is no longer subject to appeal), no more than 5 years may elapse until the date of submission of the applications.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure for sending claims for recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the competent foreign office, such as the Czech Customs Office, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">The detailed procedure follows the Methodological Guidance on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery of Claims) of 19 January 2004.25 At present, the Working Group of the Federal Government and the Provincial Governments is reviewing this methodological guideline to adapt it to the Enforcement Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The application, including the annexes, shall be submitted electronically to the intermediary office by the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="388">This Office shall check the accuracy of the application in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If the application is not correct, it shall be returned to the competent tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="390">If it fulfils all the requirements, it is referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Financial Office subsequently ensures the necessary communication with the relevant foreign office and also ensures translation of the request.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure for receiving claims for recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Applications for recovery received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and sent confirmation of receipt within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check that the formal requirements have been met.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Federal Central Tax Office shall submit such requests to the intermediary office, which shall further refer them to the competent financial authorities and monitor their execution.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">Where an application is processed for more than 6 months, it shall invite the intermediate office to submit a preliminary report to be submitted pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive No 2002/94/DG.</seg>
<seg id="398">Once the formal and factual formalities of the application have been checked, the implementing services shall notify the method of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any sums recovered must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the application within one month of receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistics</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables between Germany and the Czech Republic in the years 2006-2008 (k 31.12.2008) is contained in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Control of recovery, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">Within the framework of international cooperation, 21 requests for international assistance in the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="404">Ten selected cases were examined:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 December 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of a VAT claim for 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3,883, i.e. CZK 109,820, for a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send a request for recovery to the tax administrator until 26.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the recovered receivable, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">As it was not possible to pay the entire recovered claim even by stopping the real estate, a repayment schedule was agreed with the Czech taxpayer with instalments of min. 2,000 CZK a month.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 February 2009, information on the recovery status was sent to the German tax administration stating that, at 25 February 2009, this claim was partially recovered in instalments of CZK 49,600.</seg>
<seg id="411">This amount was sent to Germany and a further instalment of CZK 28.8.2009 was sent to Germany on 3,000.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7.1.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 180,869 in Germany, i.e. CZK 4,434,915, for VAT and income tax and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance only sent the application to the tax administrator on 27. 11. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">The tax administrator found that the debtor does not own any enforceable assets by checking the ownership of accounts with banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable goods.</seg>
<seg id="416">Furthermore, a local investigation found that the debtor did not stay at the address of permanent residence for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6.4.2009 and was sent to the German tax administration on 16.4.2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">On 21.11.2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery relating to the turnover tax arrears and accessories of the Czech tax entity amounting to EUR 3,139, i.e. CZK 84,846.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax administrator on 6. 8. 2008, although already on 18. 2. 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the tax administrator that the request for recovery was settled by payment of the claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">However, the claim in question was also paid in the context of recovery in the Czech Republic and transferred to Germany on 27.10.2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Due to long periods of time in which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the tax administrators in charge, the receivables were paid twice by the entity in Germany itself and recovered by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been included in the claim for further recovery of EUR 6,649 to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">The Czech Ministry of Finance records only a claim for recovery totalling EUR 3,139. The claim for recovery totalling EUR 6,649 is not recorded in the Czech Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15.9.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany to recover the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed EUR 39,957 in Germany for income tax and VAT and accessories, i.e. CZK 956,654.</seg>
<seg id="429">On 19.12.2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="430">The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009 and execution was ordered at the commandment of the receivable in the Czech Republic's bank accounts and the payroll deduction (withholding was CZK 7,000).</seg>
<seg id="431">When dealing with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it questionable.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Czech tax administrator found that the tax entity was in the past willing to repay EUR 250 per month, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="433">The tax entity promised to discuss the application with the German tax administrator in order to achieve a change in the amount of its claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">The recovery of the claim continued at the time of the SAO control action.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 December 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity that owed income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories totalling EUR 113 444, i.e. CZK 3 116 304.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the FA for Prague 1, which is in charge of the tax administration of non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, only on 14. 11. 2008 because it was not possible to identify the local tax administrator on the basis of that address.</seg>
<seg id="438">In the course of the investigation, the FA received information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4,704 on 19.9.2008; however, the FA could no longer issue an enforcement order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance only forwarded the request for recovery after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26.1.2009 day, the Czech tax administrator initiated recovery and issued an enforcement order commanding the debtor's money receivables in accounts held with banks and savings and credit cooperatives.</seg>
<seg id="440">The recovery of the claim continued at the time of the SAO control action.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation in recovering the VAT receivable and the costs of proceedings totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3. 10. 2006.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for recovery to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8.9.2008, the German tax administrator transferred to the Czech authorities via the Federal Bank an amount obtained from the execution of funds in the debtor's account of EUR 17,700, i.e. CZK 439,226.</seg>
<seg id="445">An error in the conversion of the recovered amount was detected when verifying the amount recovered.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recovered amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065 erroneously to EUR 583,378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct conversion of the recovered amount is EUR 5 833 781,83.</seg>
<seg id="448">A request for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1.3.2007, the Czech tax administrator sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for the recovery of the tax arrears with the Czech tax entity, which owed CZK 1,970,632 for VAT and accessories, i.e. EUR 79,847.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration only on 10. 11. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4.2.2009, the German tax administrator called on the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of the significant decreases in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the liquidation situation of the company, the following arrears were made: EUR 4 600 on 8/04/2009, EUR 3 000 on 6/5/2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16/6/2009.</seg>
<seg id="454">These payments were sent to the account of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the German tax administrator agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2,500 by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">The claim for recovery totalling EUR 398,653, i.e. CZK 9,832,779 including the real estate transfer tax receivable, was received from the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22.5.2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2. 10. 2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3.4.2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified the repayment by saying that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (1) of the Treaty. (e), (f), (g) and (b) (h) Council Directive No 2008/55/ES.</seg>
<seg id="461">Furthermore, the German Tax Administration stated that Article 2 (1) of the Treaty does not constitute State aid. g) concerns receivables related to income tax and property tax.</seg>
<seg id="462">Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive No 2008/55/ES applies to taxes on income and property listed in Article 1 (1) of the Treaty. This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 4 Council Directive No 77/799/EHS.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed to draw up and submit a new application for recovery excluding the real estate transfer tax arrears amounting to CZK 61,759 and indicating VAT arrears, corporate tax and personal income tax, which will be re-sent to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the Czech tax administrator to recover tax arrears relating to the same tax entity that owes CZK 7,079,735 in income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6.2.2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of tax arrears of a Czech tax entity that owed CZK 3,445,782 in personal income tax and VAT, i.e. EUR 123,328.</seg>
<seg id="467">Of this amount, CZK 1,133,967 was VAT.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send the application to the German tax administration until 18.4.2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded a reply from the German tax administration from 9.7.2007 to 11.11.2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The reply stated that the German tax administrator issued on 11.6.2007 an enforcement order for a bank account with the bank, but that it did not have any business relations with the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="471">By doing so, the German tax administration considered the application to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26.9.2005, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845, i.e. EUR 43,591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The application from the Czech tax administrator was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10. 10. 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax administration on 15.12.2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Before sending the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator executed the debtor's money in the bank accounts and the wage deduction and established a lien on the immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authority on 16.3.2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">The reply to the request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005 indicated that the Czech tax entity was staying in Germany and had an income of EUR 8,437 from the non-business activity.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20.4.2006, but only forwarded it to the Czech tax administrator on 12.2.2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The reply stated that no recovery procedure could have been initiated in Germany on account of the debtor's insolvency - no assets had been established and his income from the business was already subject to another enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="481">In doing so, the German tax administration considered the request for recovery to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international recovery assistance, all EU Member States are subject to the same European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="484">Therefore, the method of processing applications for international assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.</seg>
<seg id="485">The SAO and the BRH made a comparison of the statistics submitted by the two Member States for the period 2006-2008 to the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="486">The data contained in these statistics did not match.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In its 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of mismatches in statistics had decreased, even though the number of applications had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">Both SAIs consider it important to renegotiate statistics at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU countries in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">In addition, the two SAIs agree that reliable statistics should show the annual number of applications as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amount of the claims recovered by each Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by the Member States, as this can assist Member States in assessing their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">The fact that recovery rates can be calculated broken down by Member State, both SAIs consider it useful for Member States with lower recovery rates to step up their efforts and try to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit claims for recovery on time to local tax administrations.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was found for applications for international assistance received from Czech tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance failed to comply with Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on International Assistance in the Recovery of Claims, because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months of the date on which the request was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="498">4.5 Control of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="499">4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">General information</seg>
<seg id="501">The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedural procedure for controlling VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the administration of taxes and charges.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons established or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the tax period indicated in the personal/corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="504">The classification of the tax entity as a VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="505">The tax entity ceased to be referred to as a VDS if, in three consecutive tax periods since the end of the period when it filed the tax return on the basis of which it was classified among the VDS, its net turnover for the tax period fell below that threshold.</seg>
<seg id="506">A tax entity may not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax check on at least one tax for one tax period.</seg>
<seg id="507">All VDS were audited at least five years apart by the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, at least every 2 years a written evaluation of the tax entity must be carried out and the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax must be eliminated by the chosen follow-up procedure.</seg>
<seg id="509">The control of the FA is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator generally opts for several tax periods at once.</seg>
<seg id="510">The SGEI was inspected by departments of specialised inspections, which are set up for a total of 13 FTs, or by staff of control departments of locally competent FTs.</seg>
<seg id="511">The Department of Specialised Controls shall carry out tax checks within the scope specified by the Director of Financial Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities operating in unusual and specific business fields;</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities where carrying out tax checks is extremely time-consuming and professional;</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with a branched territorial and organisational structure;</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and undue lure of excessive deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax checks carried out by FA departments and the results of those inspections are set out in Table 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists of the establishment of a specialized FA with nationwide competence for selected tax entities (including for legal entities established for the purpose of doing business, which achieved turnover of more than CZK 2 billion).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">General information</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT controls for large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • the Tax Control Regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Other methodological documents are also in force.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The statutory control provisions are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - On-the-Spot Tax Check. In particular, these Articles lay down the rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot tax checks (i.e. at the premises of an undertaking), their scope in terms of subject matter, the rules on the division of responsibilities, the form and content of the control notices, the principles of control, the taxpayer's obligation to cooperate and the prerequisites for carrying out the final discussion and communication of the control report.</seg>
<seg id="526">On-the-spot tax checks are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Administration Act Pursuant to Article 5.1 (1) in connection with Art. 19 of the Act is compulsory to participate in on-the-spot tax checks carried out by the Financial Authorities for the Federal Central Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The participating authorities shall agree on the nature and extent of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in the tax controls.</seg>
<seg id="529">In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it selects are subject to scrutiny at the time it determines.</seg>
<seg id="530">In such a case, it may declare the rules on the conduct and content of inspections at the premises of such companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Regulations on tax controls According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the provisions on tax checks (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were agreed by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, upper house of the German Parliament, in which the governments of the Länder are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">These administrative provisions apply to on-the-spot checks by the financial offices of the Länder and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Undertakings shall be classified by size at regular intervals in accordance with Article 3 BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are subject to follow-up (Article 4.2 BpO).</seg>
<seg id="535">According to Article 33.1 BpO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.</seg>
<seg id="536">Methodological guidelines</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition to the above, it lays down the following additional methodology for tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Uniform manual for special VAT checks in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="539">• the USLO manual, which sets out the methodology for the use of data on intracommunity business relationships held in the VIES system;</seg>
<seg id="540">• the ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;</seg>
<seg id="541">• work aids for various and special items.</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits by business type.</seg>
<seg id="543">The data are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of companies to control - not just large companies - must be determined at regular inspection intervals.</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="547">Checks are usually announced, including VAT checks.</seg>
<seg id="548">This means that during the inspection, checks will be carried out definitively, in particular on income, excise and VAT taxes - i.e. on all types of relevant taxes.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT checks may be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT controllers.</seg>
<seg id="550">Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangements of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of tax periods covered by checks is usually between three and five years.</seg>
<seg id="552">BpO 2000 foresees a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All company taxes are subject to verification.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Control management of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">Both SAIs decided not to examine individual cases of VDS inspections carried out, but focused on management issues in order to provide an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT controls in VDS.</seg>
<seg id="556">In the form of a questionnaire, they collected information from tax authorities on the areas they consider essential to the management of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses do VDS management have at its disposal regarding VAT control?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records of rates distinguishing between combating VAT fraud and controlling VAT in general?</seg>
<seg id="560">Czech Republic: No, ADIS does not allow such resolution with the current data version.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general control of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records of timeliness of VAT checks (linked to the time period of the audited transactions)?</seg>
<seg id="563">Czech Republic: Evidence of timeliness of questioning with relevance for intracommunity acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers is reported in the ADIS system.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition, the information registered in ADIS also includes type data, how long the questioning took.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax controllers only contain information on the average time of the last check (information on the year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This figure does not provide an overview of the selected control periods with regard to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">The VAT auditors focus on the most recent period of the tax assessment; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, statistics produced at federal level for special VAT controls do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• There are some statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenues generated, broken down, for example, by the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the tax entity has unduly applied the reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of the additional tax due).</seg>
<seg id="573">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of tax assessed by type of tax, the number of tax entities audited and the number of tax periods audited.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax practices (local investigations, complaints) are followed in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">Time data and amounts of additional taxes paid shall be recorded as a separate task.</seg>
<seg id="577">There are also statistics on general debt broken down by type of tax, but not on the declared tax or tax established by the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, uniform statistics at federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT controls do not distinguish between those criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Moreover, these differences are not distinguished by the majority of tax administrations visited.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are areas of control recorded that generate high additional revenues?</seg>
<seg id="581">Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administration has the right to collect tax payers for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections of ADIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="583">Consequently, uniform statistics at federal level for tax controllers and special VAT controls do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, there is one coordinated approach between the finance ministers of the Länder and the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down their increased tax (VAT) obligation if they exceed a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In such a case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the tax increase.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most common findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- VDS make an unjustified right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:</seg>
<seg id="590">• which have not been used to carry out any economic activity under § 72 para. 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• which were used for representation under § 75 para. 3 of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• on the basis of tax documents which did not comply with the requirements laid down in Section 73 (1) of the Financial Regulation. 1 VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- VDS did not distort VAT on output pursuant to § 21 para. 1 VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: It was stated that there were no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="595">Consequently, uniform statistics at federal level for tax controllers and special VAT controls do not provide such data.</seg>
<seg id="596">The VAT findings are not separately registered by the Länder if they arise from the tax controls of VDS.</seg>
<seg id="597">However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder have to record their increased tax (VAT) obligation if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration analyse the areas of control from which there is a high "yield" and derive implications for management?</seg>
<seg id="599">Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they launch national audits focusing on risk commodities or on the subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.</seg>
<seg id="601">Uniform statistics at federal level for tax controllers and special VAT controls do not provide data on audit areas from which high "returns" are generated.</seg>
<seg id="602">There are different views on the analysis process as well as on case management in terms of relevance.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax authorities provide specific information, but their use is on the tax authorities' own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">Differences in the responses of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects the amount of data from the tax checks carried out and data from the financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.</seg>
<seg id="606">Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to guide the selection of risk-inclined cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In 2012, the Czech Republic is planning to establish a specialized tax office for the administration of VDS.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.</seg>
<seg id="610">This makes it more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on the choice of individual cases on the basis of the data from the tax returns submitted.</seg>
<seg id="612">The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to measure the exact amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">The two SAIs agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenues.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, the yield on VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="618">Cooperation between the two SAIs on parallel controls of VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.</seg>
<seg id="619">Both SAIs have got to know each other better in the following areas: • intracommunity transactions, • VAT risk management, in particular as regards the selection of risk-inclined transactions, • assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and • VAT control of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud strategies and differences in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">The control findings have been compared and best practice identified.</seg>
<seg id="622">In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within Member States, including at European Commission level.</seg>
<seg id="623">The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future VAT management control actions.</seg>
