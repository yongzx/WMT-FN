<seg id="1">The 'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, helping to track close contacts and identify individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of official governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many frameworks are in place to build close contact tracing applications.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy concerns have also been raised, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographic location of application users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance between a user and other phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the Bluetooth app support directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government and Alipay have jointly developed an app to support citizens to self-check whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">The program is now used in more than 200 cities in China, and Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">The app, developed by the local IT community, was released as open-source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia, for its part, has launched a Bluetooth-based app, "StopKorona!," to track the exposure of potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health of North Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the Close Contact Tracking app had entered an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Similar applications ("StopCovid") are planned in Ireland and France.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on the Singapore-based TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fencing app for confirmed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave home.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited a number of possible practical problems with the app system, including false positive misstatements and a possible lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population uses the app.</seg>
<seg id="15">To stamp out the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus related apps in Apple's App Store, that is, only "official" or other reputable organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy advocates say they are concerned about the use of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, especially if the surveillance infrastructure set up to deal with the outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of the outbreak is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organizations announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Monitoring and surveillance extensions must have a "sunset" clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any data sharing with third parties should be defined by law;</seg>
<seg id="26">Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "meaningfully participate," including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published checklists.</seg>
<seg id="28">The proposed Google / Apple plan aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing it from the device's operating system once tracking is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have adopted web-based, rather than app-based, location tracking, which eliminates the need for users to download apps while avoiding being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Network solutions with access to raw location data can have serious privacy concerns.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use only a central server to communicate with each other have now been created (see below for details).</seg>
<seg id="33">South Korea has introduced a system that is not app-based to perform contact tracking tasks.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using a dedicated app, the system chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data. This information is then combined to send notifications to potential infected people via text message.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using the information to alert potential close contacts, the government was allowed to make location information public as the country made significant changes to its information privacy laws in the wake of the MERS outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="36">This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites, and some countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy Close Contact Tracking is a well-established concept, with a large amount of relevant research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Power Consumption (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">PEP-PT is a coordinated scheme with centralized and decentralized methods, not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols, and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).</seg>
<seg id="40">Under these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are made on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The privacy team at MIT's Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path crossover data to track COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform is based on the research content development of the White Paper "Applications Without Reliance: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic", released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded in the MIT Media Lab and dedicated to the development of privacy technology, is developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace leverages secure hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">On April 5, 2020, a number of groups jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same approach and largely overlapping agreements, with the goal of reducing fragmented information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application uses the open-source BlueTrace protocol.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close contact tracking program, claiming that it can protect privacy by combining Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy protection encryption technology.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">Apple and Google said the system is planned to be rolled out in three phases:</seg>
<seg id="49">Roll out tools to support governments in creating official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">Integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to roll out the system through an operating system update first, and delete the system in the same way after the outbreak threat, as a way to solve the follow-up monitoring problem.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning your hands to remove dust, grease, microbes or other useless substances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Consistently washing hands with soap at certain "critical times" of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through the faecal - oral route.</seg>
<seg id="3">If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also contract respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five key moments in the day when you must wash your hands with soap: Before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before meals, before and after handling food, or before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you don't have soap and water, use grass ash to clean your hands. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands in the following situations:</seg>
<seg id="6">Prepare food before, during and after.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after taking care of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diapers or cleaning the buttocks of children who use the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="9">After wiping your nose, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching an animal, animal food or animal feces.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hand hygiene for medical staff refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing hands before dispensing medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that may harm the human body or cause disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hand washing is particularly important for people who work in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are many health benefits of hand washing, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">And to reduce the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits had a slight effect on height gain in children under five.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural changes (for example, washing hands with soap).</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple action can reduce the death rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.</seg>
<seg id="20">Advocating hand-washing as an intervention could reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, with the equivalent effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea incidents by 48%. As a spontaneous act carried out in homes, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (Acute Respiratory Infections, ARI).</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of approximately 1.8 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia together kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Making washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet an ingrained habit saves more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhoea by nearly half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter, UNICEF said.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, hand washing is often promoted alongside other sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing can also prevent pustular herpes, which is spread through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hand washing can have a slight adverse effect, that is, frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin, which can cause skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, chapped skin, called hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive and frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">To reduce fecal - oral transmission of disease, it is important to wash hands with soap at five key times of the day: After using the toilet (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before meals, before and after handling food or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">To prevent the spread of disease, the correct way to wash hands should also be used in the following situations: Before and after handling incisions or wounds; after sneezing, coughing or wiping your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">Washing hands with soap is low in many countries / regions.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest proportion, at 97%; the United States was close to the average, at 77%; and China had the lowest proportion, at 23%. Now, in order to promote the practice of washing hands with soap at critical times, a number of behavioural changes have been implemented. To enable children to develop the habit of hand washing, developing countries can choose to let school children wash their hands collectively at fixed points every day.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Basic Health Care Plan implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and schooling.</seg>
<seg id="35">The centrepiece of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap and brushing with fluoride toothpaste.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, the scheme has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soaps or cleansers are incorporated into the water to better remove microbes from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce dissolution hindrance and improve solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone cannot cleanse the skin effectively because fats and proteins (components of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, cleaning and washing hands requires reasonable use of water...</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soaps, because they can be reused, may retain bacteria left over from previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps and concluded that the bacteria could not be transferred because the bacteria would be washed away by the foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the CDC still claims that "contactless liquid soap is the best choice."</seg>
<seg id="44">Antimicrobial soaps have been heavily promoted among the health-conscious public.</seg>
<seg id="45">So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microbes in nature have been selected using recommended antimicrobials or disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soaps contain common antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, which has a large number of drug-resistant microbial strains.</seg>
<seg id="47">As a result, antimicrobial soaps may not be as effective as advertised, even if they are not chosen for antibiotic-resistant strains.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulations may contain acids that act as pH regulators (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioning agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that common soaps are just as effective as consumer grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan when it comes to preventing disease and removing bacteria from your hands.</seg>
<seg id="49">Washing hands in hot water is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria breed quickly at body temperature (37 Â°C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific studies have confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microorganisms on the hands, contrary to popular belief.</seg>
<seg id="53">Water - free hand sanitizer or antiseptic hand sanitizer is a non - water based hand cleanser.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-water-based alcoholic hand cleaners (also known as alcohol-based hand lotions, aseptic hand lotions or hand sanitizers) became popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most formulations of these hand sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is added to thickeners such as kapom (acrylic polymer) to form gels, or moisturizers such as glycerin to form liquids, or are foamy to make them easy to use, and to relieve alcohol-induced skin dryness.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity, and washing - free hand sanitizer containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol can effectively kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol rubbing can kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, cowpox, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">Alcohol rubbing with 70% alcohol content can kill 99.97% of bacteria in the hand after 30 seconds of use (3.5 orders of magnitude less, similar to 35 decibels less), and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) of bacteria in the hand after 1 minute of rubbing. Washing - free hand sanitizer is most effective for bacteria, while it is slightly less effective for some viruses.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol rubbing hand lotion is almost completely ineffective against viruses such as norovirus (also known as Nowak, Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Adequate washing and sterilizing hand sanitizer or alcohol rubbing hand lotion must be used to thoroughly moisturize or cover hands.</seg>
<seg id="60">Scrub the palm and back of the hand and between the fingers and the ends of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries out.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fingertips must also be fully cleaned and scrubbed on both palms. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that it is best to wash your hands instead of using hand lotion that is free of scrubbing, especially when it looks like your hands are dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">These hand rubs are increasingly used because they are easy to use and can quickly inactivate microbes; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless there is no soap or water to use.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol-free hand sanitizers can lead to dry skin unless a moisturizer and / or moisturizer are added to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerine and / or other emollients can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced skin dryness.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand sanitizers containing emollients significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antibacterial cleansers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic exposure to dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol rubbing hand lotion are rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">One reason for its appeal is that alcohol-free hand sanitizers are less likely to induce irritating contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">Water-free cleansers, while effective, don't remove organic material from your hands, just disinfect them.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, washing - free hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, which are still in the hands.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends to a large extent on the composition and formula. Its effect has always been much worse than that of alcohol and alcohol hand sanitizer.</seg>
<seg id="71">More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained, cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after reuse, possibly due to progressively causing adverse skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Grass ash or soil is better than washing hands with water alone, but not as good as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slow it down.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.</seg>
<seg id="76">The WHO recommends replacing soap with grass ash or sand if no soap is available.</seg>
<seg id="77">The steps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for proper hand-washing to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wet your hands with running warm or cool water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because vertical basins can be polluted, and water temperature does not seem to matter much.</seg>
<seg id="80">Use a sufficient amount of soap to repeatedly scrub to create foam, while cleaning the back of hands, fingers and nail seams.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of using water alone.</seg>
<seg id="82">Scrub for at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Scrubbing creates friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin. The longer you scrub, the more bacteria you remove.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash thoroughly with running water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Washing your hands in a basin can cause recontamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.</seg>
<seg id="87">Damp hands are more likely to be recontaminated, with thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nail stitches being the most often overlooked areas.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may harbor microbes.</seg>
<seg id="89">Moisturising lotions are often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin can lead to damage to the skin, increasing the risk of infection spreading.</seg>
<seg id="90">Where tap water and / or soap are not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, by pouring water through a hanging bucket or a porous gourd, and / or using grass and wood ash to wash hands (if necessary). Where water supply is limited (for example, in schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving hand washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, can be used.</seg>
<seg id="91">The simple faucet technique is simple. Hang a water jug with a rope, then pour a small amount of water into your hands through a foot pedal. Then use soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effectively drying your hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry your hands in a public bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="93">A growing body of research shows that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric dry phones provided by many bathrooms.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the paper towel industry's European Tissue Symposium, comparing the hygiene of paper towels, warm air dry phones and more modern jet dry phones.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing hands, using a warm air drying mobile phone to dry hands, it was found that the total amount of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 194%, and the total amount of bacteria on palms increased by an average of 254%.</seg>
<seg id="96">The total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and the total amount of bacteria on the palms increased by an average of 15%.</seg>
<seg id="97">Wiping your hands dry with paper towels after washing your hands reduces the total amount of bacteria on your fingers by an average of 76% and the total amount of bacteria in your palms by an average of 77%. Scientists also conducted various tests to determine whether various dry hand methods might cause cross-infection in other bathroom users and toilet facilities.</seg>
<seg id="98">The jet dry phone is said to spew air out at 180 meters per second (650 kilometers per hour; 400 miles per hour), capable of blowing away microorganisms on hands and fuselage, which may contaminate other bathroom users and toilet facilities within 2 meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">Using a warm air dry cell phone can spread microorganisms 0.25 meters beyond the dry cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="100">The results of using paper towels to dry hands showed no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TUV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study evaluating different ways to dry hands.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after dry hands:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involved many different dry phone manufacturers and compared these dry phones to dry hands with paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">During your trip, you can choose to wash your hands using hand sanitizing wipes without soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol free hand sanitizer should have an alcohol content of at least 60%.</seg>
<seg id="105">Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweiss discovered in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of diseases in hospitals. However, it was only after a long time that medical staff were required to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="106">Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">One study found a reduction in infection rates after using the devices.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical staff should wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to create foam and rub all parts of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="109">Rub your hands and fingers together.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is residue between the nail slits, it can be removed with a stiff brush.</seg>
<seg id="111">As the residual water on the hands may still contain bacteria, it must be thoroughly cleaned and dried with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">After drying, paper towels should be used to close the faucet (if necessary, use paper towels to open the exit door).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents recontamination of the hand by contact with these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">In health facilities, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid transmission.</seg>
<seg id="115">Reports in the New England Journal of Medicine suggest that in most medical settings, hand washing is still not at an acceptable level, with large numbers of healthcare workers often forgetting to wash their hands before coming into contact with patients, leading to the spread of microbes.</seg>
<seg id="116">Proper hand washing combined with other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, according to a study. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing methods in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organisation has also published draft hand hygiene guidelines on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby et al. Made a related roundup.</seg>
<seg id="119">If compliance needs to be proven, then commercial equipment can be measured and validated against ministry health.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" to wash your hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">After exposure to blood / bodily fluids</seg>
<seg id="122">Prior to sterile operation and</seg>
<seg id="123">After taking care of the patient, adding antibacterial chemicals to the soap ("medicine soap" or "antibacterial soap") can make the hand sanitizer sterilize.</seg>
<seg id="124">This sterilization operation may be required before surgery or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microbes. When "scrubbing" your hands for surgery, you must have taps that can be turned on and off without contact, hand sanitizers containing chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels used to dry your hands after washing, sterile brushes for scrubbing and other sterile tools for cleaning nail seams.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewelry should be taken down.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">It doesn't take long to scrub (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When rinsing, water from the forearm must be prevented from returning to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing your hands, use a sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on a surgical garment.</seg>
<seg id="130">To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is advisable to wash hands or use washing and sterilizing hand sanitizer before and after contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes when the frequency of hand washing reaches 20%, and further benefits are extremely limited when the frequency of hand cleaning increases to more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">Washing hands with regular soap led to a more than threefold increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases that spread to food compared to using antibacterial soap. After comparing rubbing hands with alcohol and washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds respectively, it was found that the proportion of bacterial infections with alcohol rubbing hand lotion was 26% lower than that of antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol in reducing hand influenza A (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and Clostridium difficile spores. Hand hygiene in medical institutions can be improved through interventions such as training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol rubbing hand lotion, and providing written and verbal reminders to employees.</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in a variety of medical settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">Washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective and important tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of a reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes widespread hand-washing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand washing table, it is very rare to have a hand washing faucet near every private or public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be due to ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and advocating the use of soap to wash hands can influence policy making, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes among residents.</seg>
<seg id="140">To be effective, there must be monitoring and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic evaluation of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of advocacy for hand-washing in schools is the "Samsung Method" promoted by UNICEF, which, among other hygiene requirements, encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="142">When minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to a maximum of three.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand-washing promotion activities may include the construction of hand-washing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of a hand-washing awareness campaign is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoji.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the avoidance of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, reports suggest that advocating hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="147">The first to recognize the importance of hand washing for human health -- especially for those who are frail (for example, mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers) -- were two pioneers in hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweiss, a Hungarian doctor working in Austria Vienna, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing."</seg>
<seg id="148">At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor known as miasma.</seg>
<seg id="149">The outbreak of foodborne diseases and iatrogenic infections in the 1980s prompted the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">In Germany, for example, "the right way to wash your hands" posters are hung next to hand sanitizers in public bathrooms, office buildings and airport bathrooms.</seg>
<seg id="152">The idiom "wash your hands" means that someone declares that they do not want to take responsibility for something or participate in something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It is derived from the biblical Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to nail Jesus, and later evolved into a widely used idiom among some English-speaking groups.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's "Macbeth," Mrs. Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse her imaginary stain, demonstrating her guilt for the crimes she committed and for encouraging her husband to commit them.</seg>
<seg id="155">Studies have shown that people who think of or envision unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities more.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, those who can wash their hands after envisioning unethical behavior are less likely to engage in other "sanitizing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion requires hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with water but no soap when washing hands is part of many religious signature hand washing rituals. These include tevilah and netilat yadayim cleansing in Bahai, Hinduism, Judaism, hand washing in Christianity and small cleansing in Islam. Religion also has hygienic hand washing regulations, especially after certain acts.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and causing a huge human catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is more transmissible, affecting more older people than younger people and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase of new coronary pneumonia related publications, this article would like to make a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will introduce basic knowledge about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review helps to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and memorable memory for the Chinese people. The outbreak of a new viral disease has forced everyone to stay at home throughout the holiday season and for many weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the related disease is called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 have died.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO warned that COVID-19 had become "public enemy number one" and that its threat could surpass that of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the virus sequence was first reported isolated from multiple patients on January 7, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="13">This paper aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">CoV has been considered a non-lethal pathogen in humans, mainly causing about 15% of common cold 4.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this century has already encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in Figure 1,1, the city of Wuhan first reported a number of unexplained pneumonia cases to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.</seg>
<seg id="21">On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the outbreak quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On January 20, the infection of medical staff was reported, suggesting that there may be human-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="24">On January 23, the city was closed and all public transport was closed.</seg>
<seg id="25">On January 24, the first clinical study of Xinguan pneumonia reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, a market considered to be the starting point for infections of unknown animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency."</seg>
<seg id="27">By the time of this report, the disease had spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Due to the rapid development of the outbreak, the final scope and severity of this outbreak has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided updated descriptions of the epidemic as follows (https: / / mp. Weixin. Qq. Com / s / Ulbi-HX _ rHPXa 1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.</seg>
<seg id="32">More men (0.31 / 100,000) than women (0.27 / 100,000) were infected with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 is mainly concentrated in Hubei and surrounding areas.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The basic regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the large-scale population movement before the Chinese New Year.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (â¥60) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoV is a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing single-stranded RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four genera, namely Î±, Î², Î³ and Î´, of which Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV are known to infect humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">The envelope stinging glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cell receptor angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide enzyme 4 (DPP4), which then undergo membrane fusion.</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome replicates, the genomic RNA, together with the envelope glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein, forms a vesicle containing the virulent body, which then fuses with the plasmic membrane and releases the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of Î²-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetic consistency in 10 sequenced samples collected from Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, the site of the initial outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="47">Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin sections of the human airway epithelium through transmission electron microscopy.</seg>
<seg id="49">The study found that human ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, compared to SARS-CoV, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a weak binding force with human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and secreted proteins encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNÎ² expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. Reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2, which forms a complex with the amino acid transporter protein B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9Ã.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex has an open and closed conformation and is assembled into a dimer. The ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV recognition and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and intermediate host</seg>
<seg id="57">Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate in bats and are transmitted to humans via civet and camel, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By comparing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other CoVs, bats are considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% consistent with two SARS-like CoVs from bats, named Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is not clear what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and its transmission route has yet to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Ji et al. Suggest that snakes are carriers of viruses from bats to humans, which involve homologous recombination within the S protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Canton, China, believe that pangolins are a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, given that a CoV found in pangolins, a long-snouted anteater often used in traditional Chinese medicine, is 99% genetically homologous to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, the definitive results are yet to be provided by concrete evidence (Fig. 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 Â°C and 40-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat -- 56 Â°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorine has been determined not to be effective in inactivating the virus.</seg>
<seg id="67">Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this new type of virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">At present, there are no detailed studies on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Fig. 4). 4).</seg>
<seg id="70">In general, viruses are first recognized by the host's inherent immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) after invading the host, including C-type agglutinin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways, which limit virus transmission and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="76">Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help these defense cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Humoral immunity, including complement -- for example, C3a and C5a -- and antibodies are also essential to fight viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients can neutralize MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by cluster morbidity are more likely to affect older adults with multiple comorbidities, as well as pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">Typically, individuals who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have impaired immune function have a higher chance of developing an infection than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of three days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is important for the health sector to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, which can prevent asymptomatic infected people from spreading the virus to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, people who come into contact with the virus or are infected usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the isolation be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It can be without any other symptoms. It can also be accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, pharynx pain, runny throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experience dyspnea and / or hypoxemia a week after onset.</seg>
<seg id="91">Severe cases can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and clotting dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even in the absence of pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="94">Two recent studies of familial cluster morbidity and asymptomatic individual transmission leading to cluster morbidity reported similar results.</seg>
<seg id="95">In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) were also the main symptoms in MERS-CoV patients.</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a higher fatality rate of MERS than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26%) and pharyngeal pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">Among SARS patients, fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and pharynx pain (13-25%) have been shown to be the main symptoms, and about 14-20% of patients need ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of February 14, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2%.</seg>
<seg id="100">By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% out of 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.</seg>
<seg id="102">An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2-4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data show that the diffusion capability of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than that of the latter two.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">Cluster morbidity usually occurs in the same family, or from the same party or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease, or a history of close contact with an infected person or patient.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, raising the alarm of extended isolation.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) was normal or decreased in the early stages of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, lymphocytosis with leukocyte count &lt; 4Ã109 / L-- including lymphocyte count &lt; 1Ã109 / L--, elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="111">Some patients saw elevated levels of hepatic enzymes and myoglobin and myoglobin in the blood, while most patients saw elevated levels of blood C-reactive protein and blood deposition.</seg>
<seg id="112">In severe cases, elevated levels of D-dimer, a blood fibrin degradation product, and progressive reduction of lymphocyte counts were observed.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most COVID-19 patients have chest imaging abnormalities characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or pulmonary glazing.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients typically develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="115">When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis can severely impair gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">As a result, the worst chest imaging findings usually coincide with the worst of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 found alveolar epithelial cell shedding, transparent membrane formation, mesenchymal lymphocyte infiltration, and multicellular somatic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with viral infection and the pathology of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary diagnostic criterion for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, as the high false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation occurred when SARS was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, Zhang Feng's team reported a scheme to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which can detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations of only 20 Ã10-18 mol / L to 200 Ã10-18 mol / L (10-100 viral copies per microliter) in less than an hour without the need for complex instruments.</seg>
<seg id="124">If validated in clinical samples, the new technique is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in treating new types of CoV, doctors mainly provide supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed for other CoV -- such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV -- and other viral diseases (Table (Table2). 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These include current and potential treatments such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended that plasma from recovered patients be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Respiratory support is therefore essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including routine oxygen uptake, high-flow oxygen uptake, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is well known that an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS can lead to cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppression is crucial in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe cases.</seg>
<seg id="138">Corticosteroids and tozhu monoclonal antibodies -- an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody -- have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storms include: Modulating T cell directed immune response; blocking IFN-Î³, IL-1, and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Bonatuzumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially ischemic osteonecrosis, which can seriously affect the prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nevertheless, the use of low and moderate doses of corticosteroids for short-course treatment in critically ill COVID-19 patients is still recommended.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, intravenous administration of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be effective in a COVID-19 patient in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Remdesivir is a new type of antiviral drug developed by the Gilead and originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, it was also shown that Remdesivir might inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, Gilead has offered the drug to China for two clinical trials of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with promising results.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, barricetinib, Î±-interferon, lobinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur after combined treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="151">Interactions between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Plasma and antibody production in recovered patients</seg>
<seg id="153">Patients recovering from an infectious disease have a long history of collecting blood to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are a type of immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies. They can recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this principle, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected into 10 critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while inflammation and viral load decreased and blood oxygen saturation increased.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, before developing specific therapies, it is necessary to validate and clarify to come up with methods that can be used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered in light of the therapeutic effects.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic response that can be life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="161">Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, and plasma is in high demand to treat critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Therefore, a more critical and practical approach is to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies, or screen for effective antibodies against proteins essential to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, TCM has been used to treat many diseases for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, the efficacy of its treatment largely depends on the combination of ingredients in the prescription, which varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate such ingredients or their optimal combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stage.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, Shufeng Detoxification Capsules and Lianhua Qingfei Capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="170">Among the 87% of patients treated with TCM in several provinces of China, the highest cure rate of COVID-19 patients was observed, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province only used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest cure rate (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is a rough comparison as there are many other influencing factors that should be included in the assessment, such as the number and severity of patients.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Zhang Boli and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with WM and TCM in combination.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM + TCM group than in the WM group alone.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most impressively, the symptom malignancy rate (from light to heavy) was significantly lower in the WM + TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM + TCM group was also lower than that in the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).</seg>
<seg id="175">Still, the effectiveness and safety of TCM need to be confirmed by higher quality controlled trials, a larger scope and more centers.</seg>
<seg id="176">Characterizing the mechanism of action of TCM therapy or its combination and, where possible, elucidating its active ingredients will also be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most people who are suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 will have great fear due to this highly contagious and even fatal disease, and those who are isolated will also feel bitter, lonely and angry.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and coughing, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">A range of psychological responses were reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicide.</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can increase anxiety and guilt about the impact of contagion, isolation and stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">An effective vaccine is essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and is often used as a complementary means of antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">The industry has made efforts to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in vivo and their protective effect against zoonotic viral infections in older adults and lethal attack models has not been determined prior to initiating clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is likely because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">In contrast, sporadic cases and cluster morbidity of MERS persisted in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies against MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for vaccine development (an average of 18 months) and the changing dynamics of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without sequelae.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients also have high morbidity and mortality.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, modeling the prognosis of the disease is crucial for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the prognosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and are significantly older than those not requiring intensive care (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for outcomes in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000).</seg>
<seg id="201">Complications and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Cardiac events are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive bile duct cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is important to note that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may interact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Abnormal laboratory results: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been seen as a potential prognostic factor for disease, treatment response and eventual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It was also suggested that there was a correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">As such, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: Chest imaging and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict COVID-19 outcomes and complications.</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroid use: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from ischemic bone necrosis, resulting in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and for short periods of time in patients with COVID-19, if needed.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under extreme stress, as they often suffered from prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of relatives and patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">Counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients escape stress and return to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">Based on demographic studies to date, the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 appears to be different from that of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, the infected person will produce a large number of viruses in the course of daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, which will bring great difficulties to the control of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-CoV transmission is thought to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most transmission does not occur in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="220">Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently making great efforts to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including the blockade of Wuhan and its surrounding cities and the continuous isolation of almost all the population.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures have already caused serious damage to China's economy and other aspects, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of development of the epidemic is slowing.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">Some other experts, however, are less sanguine.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter et al. Estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Longini and others have built models to predict the consequences of the outbreak, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal swabs in patients who recovered and were discharged two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">But, as the number of new cases dwindles, there are already encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola was predicted to cause 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">But, through strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with the human body.</seg>
<seg id="232">A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be spread through coughing or sneezing, and possibly even through direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in faeces, increasing the likelihood of faecal transmission.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study, which included 138 cases, reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by in-hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous other illnesses as well as 40 healthcare workers.</seg>
<seg id="236">Tighter precautions should therefore be taken to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have been in contact with patients or infected people.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) both help to control the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of items that may be passed on to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only the N95 (1860s series) mask can prevent the inhalation of viral bodies as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viral bodies can fully penetrate; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Because viral particles can penetrate even five stacked surgical masks, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks instead of surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical staff should also wear isolation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflamed eye.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, healthcare workers should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For members of the public in areas affected or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with sterile soap more frequently than usual, stay indoors and self-isolate as much as possible, and limit contact with potential infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to keep away from patients.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 broke into the human world as a new type of virus, based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003, its high homogeneity with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have aroused China's high vigilance.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention was still reassuring the public, saying that the new virus is not highly contagious, the possibility of human transmission is limited, and the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.</seg>
<seg id="250">This news obviously relaxed the public's vigilance, and on the eve of the Spring Festival, the key point of containing the epidemic in Wuhan was missed.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in making announcements because every word is vital to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) control potential outbreaks more tightly at an early stage rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) conduct targeted and effective exercises more frequently to raise public awareness of epidemics and regularly test and improve social response systems.</seg>
<seg id="253">The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like a recurrence of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial for controlling the outbreak and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects more older people than younger people, more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates of older patients are higher than those of younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="258">The mortality rate of SARS was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even without symptoms, people with COVID-19 can still transmit the virus, while those with SARS usually do so only in severe cases, making it far more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading far more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">In some COVID-19 patients, the results of routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, patients who have been cured may turn positive again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Considering that the research on COVID-19 is so rapid, the following key questions remain to be resolved:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal is the intermediate host that transmits the virus from its original host, assumed to be a bat, to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the transmission route, and outbreaks can recur at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus precisely enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also bind cells in other organs that express ACE2?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will this outbreak last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus inherit and evolve in the process of human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it become a global pandemic? Disappear like SARS? Or will it return as regularly as the flu?</seg>
<seg id="275">Finding answers to these and many other questions is crucial, but may take a long time.</seg>
<seg id="276">However costly it may be, we have no choice but to stop the outbreak and return our lives to normal as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">The B 'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="2">Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, multiple attempts to develop such a vaccine are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect to see a vaccine against the pathogenic virus SARS-CoV-2 within 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five vaccine candidates entered the Phase I safety study.</seg>
<seg id="5">COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a massive epidemic spread around the world, triggering massive investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations are using the published viral genome to develop a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="8">CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and said the top priorities were speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were researching and developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine in early 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main platform targets for entering Phase I security research include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Candidate Vaccine: CanSino Biologics, Type 5 Adenovirus Vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, of which 78 had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Miliken Institute) and another 37 had been announced with little public information (presumably under planning or design).</seg>
<seg id="14">Phase I-II trials carry out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled multi-site trials, while more precise and effective doses are determined.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease while monitoring for adverse reactions at optimal doses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have yet to be evaluated in humans (still in "pre-clinical" studies).</seg>
<seg id="17">Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland of Australia announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pincer vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) in the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of the development of a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Hong Kong announced vaccine development projects on January 26 and 28, 2020, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around January 29, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun developing a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="22">On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to jointly develop a vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin - converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2">By reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the amount of Ang (1-7) to inhibit the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (Angiotensin - converting Enzyme, ACE), ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human-derived version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalase located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide enzyme M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a single-pass Type I membrane protein whose enzyme-active domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme, called sheddase, cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, producing soluble proteins that are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane, mainly alveolar type II cells in the lung, intestinal epithelial cells in the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells in most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to check and balance the ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE cracked angiotensin I into angiotensin II with angioconstrictive activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2 then clears the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg - Val-Tyr-Ile-His - Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) with vasodilating activity (H-Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr-Ile - His-Pro - OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also crack many other peptides, including dearginine 9 inhibitory peptide, apelin, neurovasopressin, endorphin A, and stomach hunger hormone.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">More specifically, the S1 stinger proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis, where viruses and enzymes are co-translocated into the nucleosome within the cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the host serine protease TMPRSS2 to trigger the activation of the S protein. The inhibition of this process is being investigated as a potential treatment. Some have speculated that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".</seg>
<seg id="20">And, "For patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with lower pneumonia-related mortality, but the results were not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered as a new treatment for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and blood oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, the effective time is 30 minutes, and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor intolerance or for diseases with elevated levels of circulating angiotensin II. The efficacy of rhACE2 infusion for acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak is a new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that continues to spread in 2019 and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was classified as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and an epidemic on March 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of April 10, 2020, a cumulative total of about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and 97,000 deaths have been reported in 210 countries and regions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people were cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fatality rate in China is about 4%, while in all regions of the world it is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And may be accompanied by pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and other complications.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incubation period from exposure to onset is 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="10">The recommended preventive measures include frequent hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official agencies have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard prevention and control, and facility closures.</seg>
<seg id="12">The global socio-economic impact of the outbreak has been severe, with sports, religious, political and cultural events postponed or cancelled, while panic shopping has exacerbated widespread supply shortages.</seg>
<seg id="13">Globally, 193 countries and regions have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting about 99.4% of primary, secondary and tertiary students.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result of the spread of false viral information online, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other groups of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as groups in regions where the epidemic is severe.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry have reduced the air pollution index and reduced carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan (capital of Hubei Province), China, notified a batch of unexplained pneumonia cases and launched an investigation in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, so the new crown virus is considered zoonotic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The earliest patients were confirmed to have developed the disease on December 1, 2019, and there is no obvious link with the later batch of Huanan Seafood Market cases.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of the early cases notified in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to Huanan Seafood Market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019. The patient is a 55-year-old male from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the number of newly reported cases in China decreased, but the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased significantly. For the first time, the number of new cases outside China exceeded that in China.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among adolescents, with only 2.4% of cases among adolescents aged 19 and under worldwide. Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that about 60% of the UK population would need to be infected with the new coronavirus in order to obtain effective herd immunity.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed as positive according to the official program.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of March 23, the proportion of people tested in all countries of the world did not exceed 3% of the total population. Many countries have also issued official policies not to test people with mild illnesses, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a study published on March 16, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been tested, and these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79% of recorded cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeded the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">The basic number of infections (R0) of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the CDC suggests that R0 may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most COVID-19 patients can recover.</seg>
<seg id="30">The time from onset to death was 6-41 days for patients who could not recover, with 14 days being the most common.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of February 5, about 80% of the deaths in China were among people over the age of 60, and 75% of the deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to those who have tested positive for the new crown virus under the official program.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may far exceed the statistics, as the data may not include untested patients, such as those who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the outbreak was 4-5 times higher than the official death toll from the new coronavirus pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="35">A spokeswoman for CDC said bluntly, "We know that the number of deaths [announced] is lower than the actual value," and the rumor that the U. S. data is underestimated confirms this statement. Underestimation often occurs in epidemic areas, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. On January 9, 2020, Wuhan saw the first confirmed death in China.</seg>
<seg id="36">On February 1, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths each in Iran, South Korea and Italy outside China.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods are often used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These figures vary by region, change over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as detection, quality of the health system, treatment options, timing of the first outbreak, and age, sex, and general health status. The fatality rate is the result of dividing the number of deaths within a given time period by the number of people diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to the Johns Hopkins University, the global fatality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Mortality rates vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimated fatality rate fell from 17.3% (patients who became ill from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (patients who became ill after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of those diagnosed, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of those infected (both confirmed and undiagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process from infection to case resolution in a given population.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars have tried to calculate the above data for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection mortality rate in this outbreak is between 0.1% and 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper limit of the estimates for this range is in line with the first randomized detection of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the detection on the CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization says the outbreak is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and varies from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni, from the Penn State University, noted: "If left unchecked, infectious disease outbreaks typically enter a period of stagnation after existing hosts have been depleted and then begin to tend to ease.</seg>
<seg id="50">But at present, it is almost impossible to reasonably predict when the inflection point will occur.</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nashan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that "an end to the epidemic in June can be expected" if all countries mobilize to adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization on measures to stop the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said SARS-CoV-2 "could erupt repeatedly for one to two years."</seg>
<seg id="53">Research led by Neil Ferguson in Imperial College shows that it is important to take physical distance and other measures "before the vaccine is ready for use (which may take 18 months or more)."</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner, from the Vanderbilt University, said: "This coronavirus is highly transmissible and I don't think it's likely to disappear completely" and "could evolve into a seasonal disease with an annual outbreak."</seg>
<seg id="55">The pathogenicity of another outbreak depends on herd immunity and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may be asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients will turn severe and experience difficulty breathing.</seg>
<seg id="59">CDC lists difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden blurred consciousness, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected people may be asymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so the researchers recommend that close contacts of confirmed patients be closely observed and examined to rule out infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">Estimates for asymptomatic infections in China range from very low to 44%.</seg>
<seg id="62">The incubation period (the time interval between infection and onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. With regard to uncertainty, an example can be given: The proportion of patients with loss of smell in COVID-19 was initially estimated at 30%, but later decreased to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details about how the disease is transmitted have yet to be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="64">The disease is now thought to be spread mainly through close contact, as well as droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is within 1-2m (3-6ft) of each other.</seg>
<seg id="65">The study found that an unshielded cough could cause droplets to travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) -8.2 meters (15-27 feet).</seg>
<seg id="66">It has also been suggested that droplets produced when people speak may also contribute to the spread of the virus by staying in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is usually not airborne, people may also produce droplets when they exhale or speak.</seg>
<seg id="67">The droplets can fall into the mouth and nose of people around them and even be inhaled into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can atomize respiratory secretions, which in turn can cause airborne transmission.</seg>
<seg id="69">In addition, if a person touches a surface contaminated with the virus (including the skin) and then touches their own eyes, nose and mouth, it may also cause the virus to spread.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus could spread through faeces, but the risk is thought to be low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is the most contagious virus in the first three days after onset, but is also contagious before and after onset.</seg>
<seg id="72">Positive results can be detected as early as three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronavirus is contagious before it shows obvious symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although lab-confirmed asymptomatic cases are rarely reported, asymptomatic infections have been detected in some countries during contact tracing investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new crown virus is not completely clear, the average person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of an object varies from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature, and there have been cases of pets and other animals testing positive for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals can retransmit the virus to humans, but the UK's official body still recommends that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they would with other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronavirus in nature. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed by household soap, which can dissolve the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is now considered zoonotic.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis revealed that this coronavirus is genetically related to the Sarbecovirus subgenus (cluster B) of the Î² coronavirus genus and two bat-derived virus strain clusters.</seg>
<seg id="82">The new coronavirus was 96% consistent with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the genome-wide level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in the pangolin is only one amino acid short of the virus in the human body in some parts of the genome sequence.</seg>
<seg id="84">Genome-wide comparisons to date have found that up to 92% of the genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is the same, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="85">Infection with the virus can be initially diagnosed based on symptoms, but ultimately can only be confirmed by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.</seg>
<seg id="86">A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging features would coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommends that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization has announced several nucleic acid testing programs for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.</seg>
<seg id="89">Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used for nucleic acid detection.</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.</seg>
<seg id="91">Results can generally be obtained within a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="92">In general, the test is done with a nasopharyngeal swab, as well as a pharyngeal swab, and many labs and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods has been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, serological trials developed by Cellex have been approved for use only by accredited laboratories in emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="95">Typical imaging features of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients include asymmetry of peripheral glazing and absence of pleural effusion.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Because it coincides with other viral infections (such as adenoviruses), images not confirmed by PCR have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large Chinese study comparing chest CT results with PCR results found that although images were less specific for identifying infections, they were faster and more sensitive to detection, so they could be considered as a screening tool in endemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">An artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural network has been developed that can combine X-ray and CT to detect the image characteristics of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good personal hygiene practices, washing hands frequently, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth directly without washing hands, covering mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and dropping used paper towels directly into garbage cans.</seg>
<seg id="101">Suspected infected people should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.</seg>
<seg id="102">Physical distance is also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus, and many governments have restricted or advised against unnecessary travel to and from affected countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached the community transmission stage in most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they were infected. Healthcare workers who come into contact with suspected infected people should take standard precautions, exposure precautions and eye protection. Tracing contacts is an important means for health regulators to identify the source of infection and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">The government's use of mobile phone location data for tracking purposes has raised privacy concerns, with more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, issuing statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="106">At present, various mobile applications have been put into use or entered into proposals for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Users are alerted to information once they have been in close contact with a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misstatements about preventing infection continue to spread; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands frequently.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or having visible dirt on their hands, before meals and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because before the virus enters the human body, it only needs to use household soap to destroy its protective capsule membrane and thus play a role in killing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="112">CDC also recommends washing hands with alcoholic hand lotion containing at least 60% alcohol if there is no soap or running water around.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surface of the object can be sterilized with a variety of solutions (the disinfectant can be effective within one minute of acting on the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvinyl ketone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions (such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate) were less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends disinfecting all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and patient-used ATMs, if there is a suspected or confirmed case of a new type of coronavirus pneumonia in an office or daycare facility.</seg>
<seg id="117">Who recommends that people cover their mouth and nose with curved elbows or tissues when coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of all contaminated tissues.</seg>
<seg id="118">Medical surgical masks are recommended for those suspected of being infected, as wearing them can reduce the amount of foam exhaled when talking, sneezing and coughing and shorten the distance of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization has issued instructions on where and how to use masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place." In addition, it is recommended that the person responsible for caring for the suspected infected person wear a mask.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those who care for COVID-19 patients, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help avoid touching faces.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of cloth. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (within 1 meter (3 feet)).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China, recommends wearing masks when travelling on public transport or entering crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is strictly forbidden to enter public places without wearing a mask or covering the mouth and nose.</seg>
<seg id="127">On March 16, Vietnam required all people to wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government requires everyone to wear a mask when entering a grocery store.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, China, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, began requiring masks to be worn on trains and intercity buses on April 1.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks when going out and advised residents who cannot buy them to make their own.</seg>
<seg id="132">Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection prevention and control measures related to maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thus slow down the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; school suspensions, work stoppages and the closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="135">Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, switching to contactless greeting and keeping a physical distance from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Now, many governments have mandated or advised areas affected by the outbreak to maintain social distance.</seg>
<seg id="137">With regard to the maximum crowd size, the initial recommendation of the United States government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which was quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. The elderly and people with basic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune system impairment are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. The German CDC advised such people living in epidemic areas not to go out as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the phrase "keep social distance" with "keep physical distance" to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while still maintaining social contact, including virtual and remote contact.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the phrase "keep social distance" carries the implication of requiring people to be completely isolated from society. It does not encourage people to adopt other ways of keeping people connected. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendations include only having sex with a partner who lives together and is not infected with the virus or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is recommended that COVID-19 patients and suspected infected persons should be isolated at home.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-quarantine, and many governments have forced or advised all residents of affected areas to self-quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="143">The most stringent self-isolation instructions were also issued to high-risk groups.</seg>
<seg id="144">People who may have been exposed to COVID-19, or who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission, are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last possible exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="145">Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment / suppression and mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">Containment applies to the early stages of an outbreak, with the aim of tracing and isolating those infected, while other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures are taken to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.</seg>
<seg id="147">If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, try to make the transition to remission: Take measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Containment and mitigation measures can go hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="149">Suppression requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of regenerations to 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as leveling the epidemiological curve.</seg>
<seg id="150">This reduces the risk of collapse of the health service system and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatment options.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-drug interventions that can contain the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspending schools and canceling mass gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleanliness. In the face of a clearly aggravated outbreak, China immediately adopted more stringent epidemic containment measures, such as sealing cities and imposing strict travel bans.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">South Korea introduced mass screening and local isolation measures, and issued an alert on the activity trajectory of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provides financial support for those who self-isolate and imposes hefty fines on those who refuse to do so.</seg>
<seg id="155">Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show significant challenges in mitigating (slowing but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (reversing the spread of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">The best mitigation policies may reduce peak medical demand by two-thirds and the number of deaths by half, but they will still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of the health system.</seg>
<seg id="157">Suppression may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise once the measure is relaxed, transmission will quickly rebound.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions aimed at curbing pandemics have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="160">Taking over-the-counter cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help ease symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroids may cause the situation to worsen.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine their suitability for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">According to the World Health Organization, improving the processing capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients are the basic epidemic response measures.</seg>
<seg id="166">ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services to divert resources at multiple levels, including concentrating laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating elective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving critical care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.</seg>
<seg id="167">Speculation about the origin of the first case, known as Patient Zero, is mixed.</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">Within a month, the number of new coronavirus cases in Hubei Province gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Most of these patients are related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals. One theory is that the new coronavirus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, from zoonotic diseases. On December 26, Zhang Jixian, a doctor at the Hubei Provincial Hospital for Combined Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, was the first to find and treat a group of unexplained pneumonia patients and reported them to the Jianghan District Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="171">On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "SARS-like coronavirus."</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading "rumors," while another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The Wuhan Municipal Health and Hygiene Commission subsequently issued a notice on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="174">After receiving numerous reports of unexplained pneumonia cases, the health department launched an investigation in early January. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases roughly doubled every seven and a half days.</seg>
<seg id="175">From the beginning of January to the middle of January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces under the influence of China's Spring Festival population movement and Wuhan's role as a transportation hub and major railway hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases than China and Italy, making it the country with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, a cumulative total of more than 1.61 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths had occurred and more than 364,000 cases had been cured.</seg>
<seg id="178">Confirmed cases have been reported in about 200 countries and regions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="179">Affected by the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Area have adopted preventive and control measures that restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">National-level responses include containment, such as quarantines (also known as home orders, shelter-in-place orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of blockade, and two days later that number rose to 2.6 billion, or about one third of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the earliest case can be traced back to November 17.</seg>
<seg id="183">Dr. Zhang Jixian found a batch of unexplained pneumonia cases on December 26, and his hospital reported the situation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Jianghan District of Wuhan City on December 27.</seg>
<seg id="184">On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronavirus was found in preliminary genetic testing of patient samples.</seg>
<seg id="185">The Wuhan Municipal Health and Hygiene Commission issued a public notice on December 31,</seg>
<seg id="186">Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">After these notices were issued, several doctors in Wuhan were admonished by the police for "rumor" about the walking epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="188">China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign. Later, Xi, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, called it a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">On January 23, the government announced that it had set up a quarantine line in Wuhan, banning people from entering and leaving the city. This line was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people, making it "the largest quarantine event in human history".</seg>
<seg id="191">The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.</seg>
<seg id="192">Many places also cancelled the celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year (January 25).</seg>
<seg id="193">The government department also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Mount Vulcan Hospital, which was completed and commissioned within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">This was followed by the construction of another hospital, the Raytheon Hill Hospital, to receive more patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">On January 26, the government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations to travelers and extending the Changchun holiday, after transforming 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as the convention center and sports stadium, into square cabin hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="196">Universities and primary and secondary schools across the country have also been completely suspended.</seg>
<seg id="197">Hong Kong and Macao, China, have also taken a number of measures, particularly for schools and colleges.</seg>
<seg id="198">Many places in China have implemented telecommuting measures.</seg>
<seg id="199">In addition to the province of Hubei, travel restrictions have been imposed on other identities.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transport has been adjusted and museums across China have been temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries and regions. It is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of outdoor activity restriction.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all overseas entrants to Beijing. In the five days before March 23, there was only one local case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="203">On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of local cases has been basically curbed and the epidemic in China has been brought under control.</seg>
<seg id="204">On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that it would suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits from March 28, 2020. No details were disclosed on when the policy would end.</seg>
<seg id="205">Those who want to enter China need to apply for a visa from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.</seg>
<seg id="206">The Chinese government encouraged enterprises and factories to resume work on March 30 and provided monetary stimulus to enterprises. The State Council announced that April 4 would be designated as a national day of mourning and launched a three-minute national silence at 10:00 on the same day. The day coincides with Tomb Sweeping Day. The central government advocates that families jointly mourn their deceased relatives through the Internet in order to maintain physical distance and avoid a second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="207">On January 20, 2020, there was a confirmed case of COVID-19 in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="208">South Korea's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a new religious movement gathering in Daegu, South Korea, the New Heaven Jesus Church.</seg>
<seg id="209">Xintiandi believers who traveled from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of February 22, 1,261 out of 9,336 church members, or about 13%, had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert level on February 23, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="211">On February 28, South Korea reported a cumulative total of more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on February 29.</seg>
<seg id="212">After three soldiers tested positive for the virus, all South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="213">Flight schedules have also been adjusted due to the impact of the outbreak. South Korea has launched what is considered the world's largest and best organized virus prevention and control program, which involves screening large numbers of people for the virus, isolating all those infected, and tracking and isolating those in close contact with those infected.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods include making it mandatory for new entrants from outside the country to self-report their symptoms through a mobile app, conduct a drop-off virus test, and obtain the results the next day, while improving the detection capacity to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.</seg>
<seg id="215">Despite not isolating the entire city, South Korea's plan is considered a success for epidemic prevention and control. South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude toward President Moon Jae-in's crisis response.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many South Koreans signed the petition, some calling for Moon Jae-in's impeachment and accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak, while others praised his response strategy.</seg>
<seg id="217">On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of new cases in a single day in four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="218">On March 29, it was reported that all new overseas arrivals would be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="220">On February 19, Iran announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, and later, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health, two patients died that day.</seg>
<seg id="221">Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the complete suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated 500 million rials to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">On February 26, 2020, Iran President Hassan Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to seal off areas affected by the outbreak, but only to isolate infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, Iran announced plans to limit intercity travel, but intercity congestion continued into the Persian New Year.</seg>
<seg id="225">The Shia shrine in the Qom region is open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became the center of virus transmission after China.</seg>
<seg id="226">Many believe that the extent of the outbreak in Iran has been concealed, including that as of February 28, the retroactive results of cases in more than a dozen countries pointed to Iran, thus indicating that the actual outbreak in Iran is more serious than the 388 cases reported by the government as of that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">Iran's parliament was forced to close, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly testing positive for the virus on March 3.</seg>
<seg id="228">On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iran prisons to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="229">It noted that the risk of transmission of the virus is greater in closed institutions, such as detention centres, and that these institutions lack adequate health care measures.</seg>
<seg id="230">On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number reported in the country in a single day since the outbreak began.</seg>
<seg id="231">As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">As of March 23, Iran had 50 new confirmed cases per hour and one new death from coronavirus every 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">The actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported, according to World Health Organization officials.</seg>
<seg id="234">There is also a view that U. S. sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial resources in dealing with the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="235">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On January 31, two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="237">The number of cases in the country then rose sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">An unrelated batch of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, a cabinet meeting announced new decrees to curb the spread of the disease, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.</seg>
<seg id="239">Premier Giuseppe Conte announced: "Access to epidemic areas is strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="240">The affected areas have ordered work stoppages and the suspension of sports events. On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete suspension of schools at all levels across the country as the number of deaths in the country reached 100.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including the Italian Serie A, will be held in spectator free mode until April, but on March 9, all sporting events have been completely suspended for at least a month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On March 11, Prime Minister Antonio Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society of Anesthesiology and Analgesia and Critical Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on possible diagnosis schemes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On March 19, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, thus overtaking China as the country with the highest number of new coronavirus deaths in the world.</seg>
<seg id="244">On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of April 5, Italy had a cumulative total of 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures, with the majority of cases occurring in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">CNN has reported that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability so far to detect all people infected with the virus may be partly to blame for the high death rate.</seg>
<seg id="247">The UK's initial response to the virus is believed to be the most lax of the affected countries, and it was not until 18 March 2020 that the UK government began to impose various forms of social distance or mass isolation on its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="248">The British government has been criticized for its lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the cancellation of any non-essential travel and social contact, advising people to stay at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.</seg>
<seg id="249">On March 20, the government announced that all leisure places, including bars and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month, to prevent job losses in the crisis. On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced tougher measures on keeping social distance, banning gatherings of more than two people and prohibiting any travel and outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, the restrictions announced this time are enforced by the police through fines and the dispersal of assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="251">With the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages, which were identified as "essential," most other businesses were ordered to stop work.</seg>
<seg id="252">The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was detected in State of Washington in the Pacific Northwest on January 20, and the patient returned to the area from Wuhan on January 15.</seg>
<seg id="253">On January 29, the White House established a coronavirus task force.</seg>
<seg id="254">On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travelers from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, CDC, the leading public health agency under the U. S. government, announced that it had developed its own test kit.</seg>
<seg id="256">Still, the United States got off to a slow start in testing, obscuring the reality of the epidemic at the time.</seg>
<seg id="257">The federal government produced defective kits in February, did not approve the use of non-government kits (from academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and did not determine the restrictive criteria for testing eligibility until early March (after which medical advice is required), all of which led to the obstruction of pre-testing in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="258">On February 27, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 4,000.</seg>
<seg id="259">On March 13, the Atlantic reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 14,000.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported that "many patients with symptoms and medical advice waited for hours or days to be tested". On February 29, after the State of Washington reported the first death in the United States, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, and other states soon followed suit.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3, schools in the Seattle area were closed. In mid-March, schools at all levels across the country were completely closed. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at the Imperial College London gave forecast recommendations on the impact of the new coronavirus on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Prevention and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provides $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="263">Businesses impose travel restrictions on employees, cancel meetings and encourage employees to work from home.</seg>
<seg id="264">On March 11, Trump announced that he would impose a 30-day travel ban on most European countries except Britain from March 13.</seg>
<seg id="265">The next day, Trump extended the restrictions to include Britain and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency and began using federal funds to respond to the outbreak crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Since March 15, many businesses across the United States have closed or shortened their business hours in an effort to ease the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">As of March 17, confirmed cases had been reported in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that 10,700 new cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in New York City, surpassing the total number of cases in South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the governor of New York said that keeping social distance seemed to be working, and the valuation of doubling the interval between cases was extended from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As of March 28, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in New York City reached 32,308, with 672 deaths due to the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the number of new coronavirus infections confirmed in the United States exceeded that of any other country, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States reached 400,335, with 12,841 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on March 30, US President Donald Trump decided to extend the implementation of the social distance guidelines until April 30.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the medical vessel Comfort, with a total capacity of about 1,000 beds, anchored in New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, the United States recorded a record 884 new coronavirus deaths in 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="274">On April 3, the total number of cases in New York State exceeded 100,000. The White House instructed health officials and scientists to coordinate virus-related public statements and publications with Vice President Mike Pence's office as a way to downplay the threat and control messaging, a move that has been criticized by the public.</seg>
<seg id="275">The general approval of Trump's crisis prevention and control measures has been polarized by partisan differences.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some U. S. officials and commentators have criticized the U. S. for relying on imports of critical supplies, such as basic medical supplies, from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">Analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict transmission patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="278">According to the information released by International Air Transport Association in 2018, the largest number of passengers left Wuhan for Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei.</seg>
<seg id="279">It is also reported that Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne are also popular destinations for travelers departing from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="280">Of the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali is reported to be in the worst state of preparedness, with Australian cities in the best state of preparedness. Australia released a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) contingency plan on February 7.</seg>
<seg id="281">The report said that the understanding of COVID-19 is not deep enough, and Australia will focus on border control and communication in dealing with the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="282">On March 21, Australia declared a "human biosecurity emergency."</seg>
<seg id="283">Due to the effective isolation of public transportation in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei, some countries and regions have planned to withdraw their citizens and diplomatic personnel residing in these areas to their home countries, mainly through domestic charter flights and permission provided by the relevant Chinese authorities.</seg>
<seg id="284">The first countries to plan the evacuation were Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan has said it will not evacuate overseas Chinese from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On February 7, Brazil withdrew 34 Brazilians or family members, in addition to four Poles, one Chinese and one Indian.</seg>
<seg id="287">The Brazilian plane passed through Poland and made a brief stop before departing for Brazil, where Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens who had been to Wuhan were sent to a military base near Brasilia to be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first aircraft and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the United States Government) were withdrawn from Wuhan and sent to the Trenton Garrison base for a two-week quarantine.</seg>
<seg id="290">On February 11, another plane with 185 Canadians on board took off from Wuhan and landed at Trenton Garrison Base.</seg>
<seg id="291">On February 3 and 4, the Australian authorities withdrew 277 citizens and sent them to the Christmas Island Detention Centre, which had been converted into an isolation facility, for a period of 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="292">A New Zealand evacuation plane landed in Auckland on February 5; passengers on board, including some from Australia and the Pacific, were taken to a naval base north of Auckland to be quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="293">On February 15, the United States announced the withdrawal of Americans from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</seg>
<seg id="294">On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers landed in Trenton, Ontario, and the passengers were evacuated from the Diamond Princess.</seg>
<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating overseas Chinese from Iran. On March 14, the South African government chartered a South African Airways plane to evacuate 112 South African citizens.</seg>
<seg id="296">Passengers were medically screened before take-off and four South Africans who showed signs of the new coronavirus were left behind to reduce the risk of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans who tested negative were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="298">All South Africans (including crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions) tested negative and were sent to the Ranch Resort for 14 days of observation and isolation as a precautionary measure.</seg>
<seg id="299">On March 20, affected by the epidemic, the United States began to withdraw some of its troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that 21 countries, including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran, had provided assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">Some Chinese students attending universities in the United States also joined forces to help deliver relief supplies to areas hit by the virus in China. A joint team from the Chicago region reportedly delivered 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei Province on January 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, delivered 200,000 masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and protective clothing, to Wuhan Concord Hospital by emergency airlift by January 30.</seg>
<seg id="302">On February 5, the Gates couple announced a $100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine development and treatment, while protecting "high-risk populations in Africa and South Asia."</seg>
<seg id="303">According to Interaksyon, after Philippine Senator Richard Gordon delivered 3.16 million masks to Wuhan, the Chinese government donated another 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6.</seg>
<seg id="304">On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross Society announced that it would provide $2.26 million worth of assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="305">Japan has donated 1 million masks to Wuhan, Turkey has sent medical equipment to Wuhan, Russia has sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia has announced the donation of 18 million pairs of medical gloves to China, Germany has sent 10,000 sets of protective clothing and various other medical materials to China, the United States has donated 17.8 tons of medical materials to China and pledged an additional US $100 million in financial support to the affected countries and regions. China has also been providing assistance to other countries and regions affected by the epidemic after the Chinese cases appear to have stabilized.</seg>
<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent experts and medical supplies to Italy to help it cope with a new coronavirus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="307">Entrepreneur Jack Ma delivered 1.1 million kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, which were distributed by the African Union.</seg>
<seg id="308">Ma later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and five ventilators to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">On top of that, Ma has donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have raised concerns about Chinese-made masks and kits.</seg>
<seg id="310">For example, Spain has withdrawn 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy of only 30%, while the Netherlands has also recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium has recalled 100,000 unusable masks thought to be from China but actually from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, China's assistance is widely welcomed in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">The World Health Organization praised the Chinese authorities for their efforts in epidemic prevention and control.</seg>
<seg id="314">The World Health Organization has noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 and the current crisis, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the truth and hindering prevention and containment efforts, and in which the central government "began to update the situation regularly before the Lunar New Year holiday to avoid panic".</seg>
<seg id="315">On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose the closure measures on Wuhan, Gao Li, a representative of the World Health Organization, said that although this was "certainly not a recommendation made by the World Health Organization", it also "fully reflects the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas with the highest concentration of the epidemic" and called the move "unprecedented in the history of public health". On January 30, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the measure was first implemented during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="316">Tedros, Director-General of the World Health Organization, pointed out that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern is based on the "risk of global transmission, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".</seg>
<seg id="317">In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason to take measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".</seg>
<seg id="318">On February 5, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute US $675 million to fund the strategic readiness of low-income countries, saying that there is an urgent need to support countries that "do not have supporting systems to test people infected with the virus."</seg>
<seg id="319">Tedros issued a further statement, declaring that "the weakest link determines how strong we are" and urging the international community to "invest immediately or it will be more costly in the future." On February 11, the World Health Organization decided to name the disease COVID-19 at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tedros said that U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Antonio Guterres had agreed that "the United Nations will fully respond to the epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="321">To that end, the United Nations launched a United Nations crisis management team to coordinate a United Nations-wide response, which the World Health Organization said would allow WHO to "focus on the health response, while other agencies could also use their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development impacts of the epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="322">On February 14, a joint Chinese mission led by the World Health Organization was launched, sending international and World Health Organization experts to China on the ground to help deal with the local epidemic and assess the "severity and contagion of the disease" through seminars and meetings with key national institutions, and to assess "the impact of provincial and county-level response activities, including different situations in urban and rural areas" through field visits. On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "greater global efforts should be made to fully prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," noting that although it is too early to call a pandemic, countries should still "enter a state of preparedness."</seg>
<seg id="323">In response to the developing outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28, World Health Organization officials said they had raised the global risk level of the coronavirus outbreak from "high" to "very high", which is the highest alert and risk level of the assessment method.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for governments around the globe: Wake up.</seg>
<seg id="325">The virus may be approaching, please be prepared "and urge governments to take the right response to avoid a" worst-case scenario "globally.</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan further noted that the current data is not enough for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and that such an announcement would mean "we basically accept that everyone on the planet could be exposed to this virus."</seg>
<seg id="327">On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that a new type of coronavirus outbreak constituted a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The director-general of the World Health Organization, which has been heavily criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including delays in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic, called it "deeply concerned about the sobering spread and severity and the reality of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="329">Among the more vocal objections was a petition calling for the resignation of the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.</seg>
<seg id="330">On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Group noted that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that Governments should assume this responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="332">The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against specific groups.</seg>
<seg id="333">Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations are actively addressing the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information, views and recommendations on policy responses from countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="336">From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the impact of blockades and travel restrictions, this digital hub houses a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote a global collaborative response to the new coronavirus challenge.</seg>
<seg id="337">As the pandemic first erupted in China's Hubei Province, the United States, British Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove and Brazilian President Dilma Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro criticized the Chinese government's handling of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="338">Several provincial administrative officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for mishandling epidemic prevention work in central China, reflecting the central government's dissatisfaction with the local political body's response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="339">Some commentators believe the move is aimed at avoiding public discontent with Xi, general secretary of the Communist Party of China CPC Central Committee, over the outbreak of a new type of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, deny that the previously acknowledged outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan and support conspiracy theories that the new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">US President Donald Trump once called the new coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that China's "censorship has exacerbated the spread of the virus and turned it into what is now a global pandemic." This, in turn, is seen by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and "diverts attention from his government's failure to contain the virus."</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast obtained a cable from the U. S. government outlining a communications strategy apparently sent by the National Security Council, which said, "It's all about China.</seg>
<seg id="343">We were told to spread the message as far as possible in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "The Politician, Foreign Policy and the Bloomberg, among others, claimed that China was providing aid to the affected countries to promote its global influence.</seg>
<seg id="344">Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that there is a "geopolitical element that includes competition for influence through good offices and" politics of generosity. "</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrel added that "China is vigorously promoting itself as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."</seg>
<seg id="346">China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and has allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.</seg>
<seg id="347">On April 3, Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U. S. sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="348">U. S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid sent to other countries to their home countries.</seg>
<seg id="349">Disputes over masks have also been reported between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey has intercepted hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for not giving enough support to Italy, which is affected by the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="352">Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity. "</seg>
<seg id="354">On March 22, after speaking with Italian Prime Minister Antonio Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="355">Italian newspaper La Presse quoted an anonymous "top political official" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "of little use to Italy."</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.</seg>
<seg id="357">Attilio Fontana, the governor of Lombardy, and Luigi Di Maio, the Italian foreign minister, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his U. S. colleagues, believes that once U. S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials resume production capacity, they will reciprocate if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="360">The planned NATO "Defenders 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War and will be reduced in size at the time of the exercises.</seg>
<seg id="361">Kate Hudson, secretary general of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the "Defenders 2020" exercise: "At a time when the world is facing a public health crisis, the exercise will not only endanger the lives of military personnel of the United States and many European participating countries, but also the residents of the countries where the exercise is held." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the outbreak, with about 24 lawmakers and 15 other current or former political figures infected.</seg>
<seg id="362">On March 14, 2020, Iran President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter noted that U. S. sanctions against Iran have prevented Iran from accessing international markets and made it difficult for Iran to fight the epidemic. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family leave and raising the level of public health funding.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts predict the outbreak could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of winning re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated due to the global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="364">Japan announced that all people entering from South Korea would be subject to a two-week quarantine quarantine quarantine at a government-designated place. South Korea later criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine measures".</seg>
<seg id="365">South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude toward President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many South Koreans have signed petitions, some calling for Moon Jae-in's impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the epidemic and others praising his response strategy. The pandemic has prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation in response.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators worry that this could allow the government to tighten its grip on power.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, parliament voted for Prime Minister Orban Viktor to rule indefinitely by decree, suspending parliament and elections, and punishing anyone found guilty of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="369">The multifaceted supply shortage can be attributed to the new coronavirus outbreak, which stems from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping, and disruption of factory and logistics operations worldwide to combat the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="370">The U. S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="371">Panic shopping has occurred in many places, resulting in the emptying of shelves of essential items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">The technology industry in particular has also been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to Tedros, Director-General of the World Health Organization, the public demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.</seg>
<seg id="374">This demand resulted in a 20-fold increase in the price of these products over the usual maximum and a delay of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies,</seg>
<seg id="375">It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization has warned will pose a threat to healthcare workers.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, the pandemic has opened up new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">The campaign led to shortages of infant formula in some supermarkets, which were immediately banned by the Australian government. Despite the severity of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there were no serious food shortages in the two places.</seg>
<seg id="378">Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade in key products have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, while such problems are expected in Europe and North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Agricultural production in northern Italy has not fallen significantly, but industry representatives believe prices could rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">The emptying of food shelves is only a temporary phenomenon, even in Wuhan, where Chinese government officials have also released pork reserves to guarantee adequate nutrition for residents.</seg>
<seg id="381">Italy has a similar law requiring food producers to stockpile supplies for such emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy has already affected China: A media report on March 16 said that in the first two months of 2020, China's economy suffered a huge impact due to the government's measures to contain the epidemic, with retail sales plunging 20.5%.</seg>
<seg id="383">As mainland China is the world's major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="384">According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Group, the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could exceed the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.</seg>
<seg id="386">An expert from the Washington University in Saint Louis estimated that the impact of the outbreak on global supply chains would amount to more than $300 billion and could last as long as two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "in a tough spot" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On February 24, global stock markets fell as a result of a sharp increase in cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On February 27, various U. S. stock indexes, including the Nasdaq 100, S &amp; P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, all saw their biggest declines since 2008, with the Dow down 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.</seg>
<seg id="390">All three indexes fell more than 10% on the week.</seg>
<seg id="391">On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Fears of a new coronavirus caused the stock market to plummet again, with the biggest drop coming on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many people think that economic recession is a high probability event.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks and states for taking timely and urgent measures.</seg>
<seg id="395">Compared with the financial crisis of 2008, the central bank reacted more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="396">The travel industry has been among the hardest hit by the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions, and advice from governments to avoid travel.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to falling demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas Airlines, while British feeder airline Flybe has tragically collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="398">The cruise industry has been hit harder than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also forced to close.</seg>
<seg id="400">The outbreak coincided with the Spring Festival holiday in China, which was originally an important tourist season.</seg>
<seg id="401">State and local governments have canceled a series of events involving crowds, including the annual Spring Festival, and private companies have closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Imperial Palace and the traditional temple fair, were cancelled and closed to prevent large crowds from gathering.</seg>
<seg id="403">Of China's 31 provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions, 24 extended the New Year holiday to February 10, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong, China, raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, with schools closed until March and New Year celebrations cancelled. Retail sales have been affected globally, with shops operating shorter or temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Retail sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retail sales in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60%.</seg>
<seg id="408">In addition, the outbreak also led to a 33-43% drop in shopping center traffic in March compared with February.</seg>
<seg id="409">Mall operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as adding sanitation facilities and installing heat scanners to measure shoppers' temperatures, while also canceling some activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic could lead to 14 million to 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="411">There are nearly 300 million migrant workers in China, many of them stranded at home in inland provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronavirus outbreak could lead to 47 million job losses in the United States, with unemployment likely to reach 32%. The Indian blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of (daily wage) Indian migrant workers. A Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. Since Spain imposed the blockade in mid-March 2020, nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the second half of March, four million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and one million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million German companies have introduced government-subsidized reduced hours for their employees.</seg>
<seg id="414">France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German system of compensation for time-lapse work.</seg>
<seg id="415">The performing arts and cultural industries have also been hit hard by the epidemic, which has not spared organizations and employees and individuals employed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="416">Arts and cultural industry organizations strive to uphold their mission (often funded by the government) to showcase cultural heritage to communities, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing arts venues and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and scheduled exhibitions, events and performances have been cancelled or postponed.</seg>
<seg id="418">In response, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The outbreak will also lead to the cancellation of many religious services, major sports events and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) in the near future, and this negative impact will rapidly intensify.</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry has also been hit, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week commemorations in Rome, which will take place during the last week of Christian Lent.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses advise older Christians to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches hold services on radio, live online or on television, while others allow in-car worship.</seg>
<seg id="421">As the Roman Catholic Quarter closed its churches and churches, Christian pilgrims were nowhere to be seen in St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted services or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and guest houses.</seg>
<seg id="422">Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak. Prayer shrines were also later forced to close, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering Makkah and Madinah shrines.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic has wreaked the worst havoc on the world sports calendar since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events had to be cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey Federation season.</seg>
<seg id="425">The outburst disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled for the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed, and live poker games had to be postponed or canceled.</seg>
<seg id="426">This, in turn, has led many gamblers to turn to online gambling, with several online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">Some artists have also sought to continue creating and sharing works via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or creating online "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.</seg>
<seg id="429">Online, numerous internet memes featuring the new coronavirus have gone viral. At a time when uncertainty is spreading, many people are turning to humorous and diversionary ways to deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries have intensified.</seg>
<seg id="431">Incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred have occurred in many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.</seg>
<seg id="432">Numerous reports in February, when most cases were still confined to China, documented the racist sentiments of different groups around the world towards the Chinese, arguing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate retaliation.</seg>
<seg id="433">Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="434">It is reported that many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been subjected to regional discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="435">Both offline and online, there are voices supporting the Chinese as well as residents in areas with severe outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="436">As the outbreak spread to other hotspots, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19. People from that country could also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from their countries in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the topic of # ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese don't come to Japan), initiated by someone on Twitter, has been widely disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese, as well as other Asians in the UK and US, have reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">US President Donald Trump has come under fire for calling the new coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics citing racial discrimination and anti-China tendencies in his comments.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students from northeastern India (bordering China) and studying in major Indian cities have also reportedly been harassed by an outbreak of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="442">BJP West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have destroyed nature, "so God will retaliate against them."</seg>
<seg id="443">The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta as "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents have also been exacerbated by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" that should be targeted for "garbage disposal."</seg>
<seg id="444">Many paywall newspapers have removed paywall restrictions for some or all of their coverage of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="445">Many scientific publishers have published some scientific papers related to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="446">Other scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 Workplace Prevention and Control</seg>
<seg id="2">COVID-19 Workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent and control dangerous coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">The appropriateness of workplace hazard prevention and control depends on the specific work site and task, and should be based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community and the risk factors of vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the requirements of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, low-exposure work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues. Therefore, basic infection prevention measures are recommended. These include frequent hand washing, encouraging employees to live in isolation after illness, observing breathing etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may become infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This includes staff who are exposed to the general public, such as schools, high-density work environments and some large-scale retail environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use high-efficiency air filters and sneeze protection devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and take other risk prevention and control measures when exposed to COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure for medical staff and mortuary staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff perform aerosol-producing operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or dispose of specimens from them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hazard prevention and control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The outbreak of COVID-19 could have serious repercussions in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff may miss work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">There may also be changes in business models, including changes in demand for goods, or changes in access to those goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours, or using distribution or drop-off delivery services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, product logistics from areas with severe COVID-19 outbreaks may be disrupted, and infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide conservation actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">These programs address risk levels associated with a variety of workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as the elderly or groups with chronic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious disease prevention and response plans may be subject to national or local recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goals of responding to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework in occupational safety and health. It is used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to their effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the hazards of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control refers to isolating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on employee behavior for control, which is also the lowest-cost solution to implement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative control refers to changes in work policies or procedures that require staff or employers to take action on their own.</seg>
<seg id="23">Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposures.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of PPE need to be selected according to the level of danger faced by staff, equipped as applicable (such as breathing apparatus) and must always be worn correctly, regularly checked and maintained, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, low-exposure jobs have the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended that all workplaces take basic infection prevention measures, including washing hands frequently, advising sick employees to live in isolation at home, observing breathing etiquette when coughing or sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage cans, preparing for telecommuting, commuting on wrong peaks when necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and disinfected on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="27">Timely identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees who exhibit acute respiratory symptoms should be quarantined at home for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there are no fever, fever signs or any other symptoms. The sick leave policy should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of sick family members at home, and employees should be clearly informed of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, moderate exposure work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with an unknown or suspected COVID-19 patient within 6 feet (1.8 meters), but may cause an individual to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission near the workplace or due to a possible recent visit to a COVID-19 outbreak area.</seg>
<seg id="30">This category of staff includes staff who work in schools, high-density work environments, and some high-volume retail environments that will come into contact with the general public. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, improving ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze protection devices, and installing drop-off windows to provide customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to live in isolation, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing staggered peak shifts, eliminating non-essential travel to COVID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communication plans, including forums to answer staff questions, providing staff with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, providing staff with training on the use of COVID-19 protective clothing.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such staff would ideally need to be equipped with breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone falls ill on an aircraft, proper precautions should be taken to protect staff and other passengers. This includes arranging for the patient to be six feet away from other passengers, designating a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when nursing sick travelers, touching bodily fluids or potentially polluting surfaces. Crew members should also wear additional personal protective gear if sick travelers experience symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag. Contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard prevention and control measures also include postponing travel in case of illness. If fever or other symptoms occur on board, self-isolate and immediately notify the ship's medical room.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the compartment of the quarantined person. For schools and childcare places, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if an infected person has been present in the school, the corresponding school and childcare place should be closed for a short period of time for thorough cleaning or disinfection, regardless of the spread in the community.</seg>
<seg id="36">For low- and medium-level community communication, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as eliminating field trips, assemblies and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, choir classes or cafeteria meals, increasing the distance between desks, staggered peak attendance and departures, limiting non-essential visitor visits, and arranging separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the community transmission is serious, consider extending the suspension in addition to implementing the social distance strategy. For law enforcement officers who perform routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the immediate health risk to be low.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement officials who must come into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or suspected individual should follow the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the event of close contact during the arrest, the staff member shall first clean and disinfect his service belt and equipment before using household cleaning spray or rags for cleaning, and shall comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="41">Workers at high risk of exposure include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are physically exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infections.</seg>
<seg id="42">The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff perform droplet generation procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of an infected or suspected infected person.</seg>
<seg id="43">Droplet generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mortuary staff at high risk of exposure include staff involved in sorting out the bodies of the deceased, who were confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during their lifetime, and who are at higher risk of exposure if autopsies are performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group also include isolation rooms for confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, including when performing droplet generation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some health care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.</seg>
<seg id="46">Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that different waiting areas be designated for patients based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective gear, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also recommends that people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as those performing droplet generation procedures, wear breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="48">The United States requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 filter masks or better masks in the context of comprehensive written respiratory protection programs such as health testing, training and medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of breathing apparatus can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. The WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through bodily fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">The WHO recommends that screeners at entry points simply wear medical surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="51">The WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to collect breath specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without having to perform droplet generation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="52">To perform the droplet generation procedure, medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks.</seg>
<seg id="53">Given the global shortage of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through measures such as telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only direct caregivers into the rooms of COVID-19 patients, using PPE only when it is really necessary for a specific task, continuing to use the same breathing apparatus while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic personnel.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms can include weakness, muscle soreness, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incubation period from exposure to onset is 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although symptoms are mild in most cases, some cases can progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of April 17, 2020, a total of more than 2.24 million cases and more than 153,000 deaths had been reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people have recovered from treatment, and the virus is mainly transmitted from person to person through close contact, often through droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although exhalation produces droplets, droplets usually land on the ground or on the surface of various objects and do not cause long-distance transmission.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, if someone touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their own eyes, nose and mouth, they may also be infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can live on the surface of an object for up to 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although transmission is also possible in the early stages and later stages of recovery, it is most contagious in the first three days of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection with nasopharyngeal swabs.</seg>
<seg id="12">People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Advice on the wearing of masks by the public varies from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks and others requiring them.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is no COVID-19 vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or may have suspected flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, weakness and shortness of breath.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, blurred consciousness, difficulty waking up and blue face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, were also monitored.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some Chinese cases initially showed only chest tightness and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases can develop into viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call this the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5% of those infected will have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report noted that not all infected people will have symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of asymptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic has not been fully clarified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that asymptomatic infections may promote the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of asymptomatic infections has not yet been determined and research is still being stepped up. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of confirmed cases show no symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">The National Health Commission of China has included asymptomatic cases in its daily notification since April 1; of the 166 infected cases on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both sputum and saliva can carry large amounts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speak loudly and spray more droplets than normal speech.</seg>
<seg id="30">A Singapore study found that an unshielded cough could cause droplets to travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are generally not airborne, the United States National Academy of Sciences determined that they may be transmitted through bio-aerosols, and an air collector in the hallway outside the hospital room detected a positive sample of viral RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can atomize respiratory secretions, which in turn can cause airborne transmission.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, but the risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when a patient has symptoms; although it can spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although the transmission power of the new crown virus is not completely clear, the average person can infect 2-3 people. The survival time of the virus on the surface of an object varies from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper products of 99% purity.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">If used correctly, soaps and cleansers can also have the effect of killing the virus. Soap products can degrade the fat protective layer of the virus and inactivate it, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, a surgical disinfectant, were less effective. On average, saliva samples were taken two days after admission, according to a study in Hong Kong, China.</seg>
<seg id="39">5 / 6 of the patients had the highest viral load in the first sample and 1 / 6 of the patients had the highest viral load detected the next day.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the associated coronavirus in nature.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the virus enters the body, it can be killed with household soap, which can destroy the protective capsule of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell via angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highest in the lung's type II alveolar cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell via a special surface glycoprotein called "prickles" (cystic particles).</seg>
<seg id="45">Acute myocardial injury was found in 12% of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, with a high proportion of serious cases.</seg>
<seg id="46">The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorder caused by the worsening process of the disease. However, acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="47">ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in regulating cardiac function.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is reported that the high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in COVID-19 patients under ICU supervision may be related to poor prognosis. The autopsy of COVID-19 patients found diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) and inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has a penchant for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 will experience a systemic overinflammatory response.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secreted T cells in COVID-19 patients were associated with the collection of inflammatory IL-6 secreted monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy report also found lymphocyte infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="52">The WHO has published several disease detection programmes.</seg>
<seg id="53">The standard detection method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test typically tests airway samples taken with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be carried out, but require a two-week interval between two blood samples, and the results are of little immediate value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection reagents, which in turn can detect infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect not only active infections but also whether individuals have been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not been popularized.</seg>
<seg id="59">According to China's experience, the detection accuracy is only 60% to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent and put it into use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital propose a method for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.</seg>
<seg id="61">In the early stage of infection, double lung poly glazed silhouette was found, with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="62">With the development of the virus, subpleural dominance, lithotripsy (thickening of the interlobular septum with varying degrees of alveolar filling) and pulmonary consolidation may occur.</seg>
<seg id="63">Little information is available on the microscopic pathological damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main pathological findings of the autopsy were as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Naked eye examination: Pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary firmness and pulmonary edema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Mild pneumonia: Pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, large number of atypical lung cells, interstitial inflammation accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multicore giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe pneumonia: Diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar effusion.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Convalescent pneumonia: Liquefaction of alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: Diffuse Intravascular Coagulation (DIC); Young White - Young Red Cell Response</seg>
<seg id="72">Precautions that can be taken to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home; avoiding entering crowded areas; washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if you don't have a tissue, use the inside of your elbow to shield it.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended to properly clean hands after coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public to go some way to prevent asymptomatic patients from spreading the virus. Central to the strategy of maintaining social distance are closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people coming into contact with large groups.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, the social distance guidelines stipulate a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) in interpersonal communication.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected to be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, known as "leveling the epidemiological curve."</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or having visible dirt on their hands, before meals and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is also recommended to wash hands with alcoholic hand lotion containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and running water around. For areas where it is not possible to purchase water-free hand sanitizer, WHO has provided two formulations for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations stimulate antimicrobial activity through ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores from alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfecting active substance."</seg>
<seg id="82">Add the glycerine as a moisturizer.</seg>
<seg id="83">Provide people with supportive care, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.</seg>
<seg id="84">The CDC recommends that suspected carriers of the virus wear improvised masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits have yet to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to improve immunity by maintaining personal hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyle and eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive therapies may be effective for patients with mild illnesses in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have launched an initiative calling for proper care of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="88">U. S. Critical Medicine and Lung Specialists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies and made them available free of charge through IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, no COVID-19 specific therapy has been developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. Special care should be taken when performing operations that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or ventilation by hand, in a medical setting.</seg>
<seg id="92">For healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that patients should be transferred to the Airborne Infectious Diseases Isolation Unit (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, exposure prophylaxis and airborne prophylaxis. The CDC outlined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If you can, it's best to use a respirator (not a mask).</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 mask is approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized its use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is primarily used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but cannot be used for other purposes to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.</seg>
<seg id="96">If you don't have a mask, the CDC recommends using a face mask and wearing a homemade mask if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Medical staff are actively carrying out research in the hope of providing respiratory support to COVID-19 patients with symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided by high nasal flow oxygen therapy or bipolar positive airway pressure ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not clear whether the two treatment options can have the same effect on severe patients.</seg>
<seg id="100">If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use invasive mechanical ventilation because the technology can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to transnasal high-flow oxygen therapy. Serious cases are mainly in the elderly (those over 60, especially those over 80).</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient, and given the limited medical conditions, the medical system is unable to cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A Chinese study found that 5% of patients need to be sent to intensive care, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% will die as a result.</seg>
<seg id="103">About 30% of COVID-19 admissions in China end up in the ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">With the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation is further increased and oxygenation becomes more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="105">At that time, a ventilator that supports pressure control mode and high PEEP is needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by the ventilator.</seg>
<seg id="106">Older ventilators may not achieve high PEEP.</seg>
<seg id="107">Research on potential therapies began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs have entered the clinical trial stage.</seg>
<seg id="108">Remdesivir seems to be the most promising drug out there.</seg>
<seg id="109">Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">In severe cases, antiviral drugs may be tried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The WHO called on a broad range of volunteers to participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential therapies. The FDA has temporarily authorized blood plasma transfusion during the recovery period as an experimental treatment for critically ill patients with life-threatening conditions.</seg>
<seg id="112">At present, the necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to prove whether the therapy can treat the disease safely and effectively.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China released a mobile app to contain the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are required to enter their name and ID number as required.</seg>
<seg id="115">The app can detect "close contact" through monitoring data, and then judge the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of three other users.</seg>
<seg id="117">Once a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also alerts local health officials. Using a combination of big data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, it tracks infected people and those they come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.</seg>
<seg id="119">The purpose of this measure is to enforce isolation and protect groups that may come into contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated mobile phone location data with Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect people who violate quarantine rules.</seg>
<seg id="122">Giulio Gallera, Italy's regional health commissioner, noted that mobile phone operator data showed that "40% of citizens are still moving around."</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government has held a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon involving more than 42,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="124">Separately, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="125">Isolation, travel restrictions, treating side effects or worrying about your own infection can all be nagging.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC quoted Rory O 'Connor as saying that "social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic malaise are the perfect storm to hurt people's mental health and wellbeing."</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease is mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="128">Mild cases can usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases can take three to six weeks to recover.</seg>
<seg id="129">According to other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 in severe cases, but lack the support of COVID-19 data. COVID-19 may affect the lungs of some people, which can lead to pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most affected areas, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which in turn can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.</seg>
<seg id="132">Coagulation abnormalities were found in 6% of COVID-19 patients, especially the prolonged time of thrombin, while 4% of the patients in this group had abnormal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="133">Liver enzymes (transaminases) were elevated in about 20-30% of COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time from onset to death was 10 days, of which the average length of stay was five days.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between admission and death for patients transferred to ICU was seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">The Early Case Study found that the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">A study by the National Health Commission in China found that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.</seg>
<seg id="138">Histopathological examination of autopsy lung samples revealed diffuse alveolar injury with cellular fibromyxoid secretion in both lungs.</seg>
<seg id="139">Viral cell lesions were observed in lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="140">Lung imaging is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the deaths reported in National Health Commission, China, 11.8% were due to cardiac damage caused by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of patients admitted to the hospital have a previous medical history, and the availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect the mortality rate.</seg>
<seg id="143">Given regional differences and methodological difficulties, estimates of disease mortality vary.</seg>
<seg id="144">Underestimating mild cases can lead to an overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, if the death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die. There are concerns about the long-term sequelae of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="147">The Hospital Authority in Hong Kong, China, found that the lung capacity of some of the recovering patients fell by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organ damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">In addition, you may face post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether previous infections will lead to effective long-term immunization for those recovering from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="150">According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronavirus, it is possible to develop immunity, but some COVID-19 cases were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus shortly after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="151">These cases are believed to be worsening rather than reinfection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is thought to be natural, originating in animals and infecting through spillage.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin is yet to be determined, but as of December 2019, the infection is almost entirely interpersonal.</seg>
<seg id="154">The first study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in the Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date of onset was 1 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">The earliest date of onset reported by the official WHO publication is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">These figures vary by region, change over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as detection, health system quality, treatment options, timing of the first outbreak, and age, sex, and general health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO designated ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 deaths infected with COVID-19 but not laboratory confirmed. The fatality rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to the statistics of the Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822 / 2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">Other measures include case mortality (CFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of those diagnosed, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects disease deaths as a percentage of those infected (both confirmed and undiagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process from infection to case resolution in a given population.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.</seg>
<seg id="163">Castiglione d'Adda, the epicentre of the Italian outbreak, is a small town of just 4,600 people. So far, 80 people (1.7%) have died in the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival festivals and even reached young people, but the mortality rate was relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified.</seg>
<seg id="165">Moreover, Germany's health care system is overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">Blood donor assessments indicate that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">To date, 69 people (0.004% of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by gender.</seg>
<seg id="169">Chinese and Italian studies have shown that men have a higher mortality rate than women.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men aged 50-60 had the highest risk of death, with only a similar gender gap in the age group of 90.</seg>
<seg id="171">The mortality rate in China is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact cause of this sex difference is unclear, but it may be due to genetic and behavioural factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Sex-based immunological differences lead to lower rates of smoking among women and lower rates of complications (such as hypertension) among men than among women, resulting in higher mortality rates among men than among women.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, men account for 57% of infections and 72% of all deaths due to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U. S. government has not tracked sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.</seg>
<seg id="177">Female health workers (especially nurses) have a higher proportion and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="178">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease "COVID-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained this: CO stands for "crown", VI for "virus", D for "disease" and 19 for the first outbreak time (31 December 2019).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (for example, China), animal species or populations, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggers COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus that causes COVID-19" in mass communication.</seg>
<seg id="182">Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019 - nCov and 2019 - nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary virus and disease names, based on the 2015 guidelines on the use of location in disease and virus names.</seg>
<seg id="185">The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="186">Given capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing health care materials, such as nose swabs and breathing apparatus parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, an Italian hospital was in desperate need of ventilation valves, suppliers were unable to deliver components within the required time, and a local startup carried out reverse engineering to print out the required 100 ventilation valves overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research to develop vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the efficacy of four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is no vaccine yet, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to take advantage of the previous work of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, the researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">Using such viruses, whether inactive or dead, the aim is to provoke a rapid immune response in the body when newly infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine, which aims to develop a vaccine that excites the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this type of study focused on the S-prickle protein, which assists the virus in invading the ACE2 enzyme receptor.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a novel vaccine development technology).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine developed by the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="203">Vaccines contain harmless genetic sequences copied from disease-causing viruses. It has long been thought that antibody-dependent enhancements could be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this claim is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven trials were evaluated and approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of research in China, and nine Phase III clinical trials on Remdesivir will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir combination interferon Î².</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, Remdesivir's efficacy has been preliminarily confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">It was observed that the clinical symptoms of the patients treated with the sympathetic drug Remdesivir were alleviated.</seg>
<seg id="210">At present, the United States, China and Italy are conducting Phase III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a study on chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) and obtained preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there have been calls for a peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">Health authorities in South Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram per day, while reminding that twice the dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. China's seventh edition of the guidelines also proposes to use interferon, ribavirin or abidol hydrochloride to treat COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data showed that high doses of ribavirin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="216">After confirming the low concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2, further in vivo studies using nitazonite were recommended. The study showed that the primitive stinging protein triggered by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors to enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="217">Whether used in combination with azithromycin or not, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies have serious limitations and cannot be accepted by the medical community unless further studies are conducted. Oseltamivir has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not been found to have therapeutic effect on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms may be a complication of later treatment in severe COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. After completing a small study, the National Health Commission of China included tozhu monoclonal antibody in its treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">Following the positive test results of severe patients, Italy is conducting a national phase 2 non-randomized trial.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combining serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, which are thought to kill some of those infected, is designed to curb the progression of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, with the support of a retrospective case study, the FDA approved the use of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by other causes, known as CAR T-cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tozumab is effective in the treatment of CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">Purified concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 are being studied and injected into people who need antibodies as passive immunotherapy until the vaccine is developed successfully.</seg>
<seg id="225">The strategy was tried during the SARS outbreak, but the efficacy is inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="226">Viral neutralization is an expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy mediates SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, some other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis can achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy are being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="229">The volume of convalescent serum production is likely to increase in favor of rapid deployment. The serum is made up of the liquid part of the convalescent patient's blood, which contains specific antibodies against this virus.</seg>
<seg id="230">Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes</seg>
<seg id="231">Wuhan Central Hospital Li Wenliang raised awareness of the spread of the new crown virus, then unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stores in Australia have lowered the cap on the amount of toilet paper they can use per transaction</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their per-transaction toilet paper purchase caps to two packs and one pack in all their stores across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The restrictions are posted in the form of messages at the checkout counter or posted to the chain's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">Buyers are hoarding goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they need to isolate themselves, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths also capped door-to-door purchases of toilet paper at every single pack.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of four packs per transaction on March 4 and 5 respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles reported in its March 8 press release that "many stores still sold out within an hour of arrival" after the four-pack limit was imposed, calling the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a Woolworths spokesman, there was a "sharp increase" in sales last week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, Costco stores in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further ease the shortage, Coles ordered larger packs from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries. Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI prepared stock in advance for the planned Wednesday special.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers tried to stock up, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made that difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects production costs to rise and preferential activities to decrease as suppliers try to meet demand.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to hold Wednesday special events after the early release of stock.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report by News. Com. Au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert based in the Queensland University of Technology, said stores were restocking every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">'Toilet paper is a big item, so there is less stock and, once sold out, it leaves a huge amount of shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of shortages.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths' view is that if there are many items on the shelf, such as rolls of paper and hand sanitizer, that can be [bought] and are plentiful, you may not panic as much," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="18">Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that it had run out of stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News. Com. Au, Kimberly Clark, which makes soothing toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent toilet paper, both stressed that they are working around the clock and on weekends to guarantee supplies.</seg>
<seg id="20">Real estate website Domain. Com reported that some real estate developers would offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne because buyers had a long Labor Day weekend off and fewer auctions were held.</seg>
<seg id="21">NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, includes eight pages of inserts in its Thursday edition intended for use as toilet paper after cutting.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to do so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that demand was also high for other goods, including masks, hand sanitizers, dry goods, hand sanitizers and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, outside Australia, British online supermarket Ocado on Sunday night limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls each.</seg>

<seg id="3">Theme: [Covid-19] Light up and ready for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">Date / time of dispatch: 14 March 2020 at 00:24 (UTC)</seg>
<seg id="5">Licence: CC0: No rights reserved</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the beginning of this month, we have encountered some difficult circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly feel the solidarity of the destiny of all mankind, but also recognize our responsibility to each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires people around the world to empathize, work together and promote community building, which is Wikimedia's core philosophy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The friendship and care that all colleagues convey to each other through email, telephone and chat is a testament to the extraordinary nature of our colleagues and how fortunate we are to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am extremely grateful and proud to be a colleague with all of you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They made me realize how meaningful it is for the world to be able to use Wikipedia at this time, and at the same time made me realize the symbolic power that this critical resource brings to people around the world to stay on track.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your job is responsible for website operation, salary payment or community safety, the normal operation of Wikimedia is inseparable from your hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now more than ever, the world needs information from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, the content of our work and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibility that colleagues shoulder, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjustments to working methods and schedules</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's modus operandi and timetable over the next few days to months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the meeting, we considered what we considered to be an appropriate response to the company's current challenges, as well as best practices to ensure the company remains sustainable during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="20">The executive team agreed to relieve the pressure on the company's employees so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you to reduce the work pressure appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), with subsequent changes to be announced.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours every day, we will arrange tasks for you according to your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as taking care of your family, going shopping or seeing a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will not keep track of your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are ill, please put down your work.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is self-evident, but we would like to remind you, please rest assured.</seg>
<seg id="29">You don't need to take sick or paid leave, but you need to inform your manager and help your team revise their work calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of the talent and culture operations department, which will support you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)</seg>
<seg id="31">For hourly employees, we will pay them in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have expressed and recommitted ourselves to the commitments we have made to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="33">The payments we make to everyone will continue to be calculated on the basis of what they would be paid for doing their normal hours under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if you are sick or unable to work.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many people choose to work to communicate with the outside world and release their stress.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can be incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like this.</seg>
<seg id="38">But taking care of yourself still comes first.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask that you keep in touch with the manager so that we are up to date with your situation and make adjustments accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Priority is given to securing important work.</seg>
<seg id="41">We have to keep some important work running.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fundraising team (and others) is critical and may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin to assess current objectives with all departments and shift our focus to supporting a number of matters that are critical to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the projects that matter most.</seg>
<seg id="45">A temporary slowdown will not affect future development.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are not going to "work overtime to catch up" after the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="47">We won't ask you to work overtime to catch up with the schedule, because it seems impractical now.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new targets and timetables as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">How will the APP (Annual Plan) change?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to the new reality and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time to develop a budget that will allow employees to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families; and to adjust work schedules for those employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">Extended schedules can significantly reduce the current planned workload and reduce work pressure across the organization.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will present the above proposal to the board of directors next week, and if the proposal is approved, we will update the delegates and the teams on the subsequent work schedule as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office conditions, exposure and cleanliness</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a colleague in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">But, out of an abundance of caution, we hired some antiviral cleaners to fully sanitize the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators leading to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement and using the corresponding products to safeguard the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are confident that the office is fully prepared to welcome everyone when they decide to return to work.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington D.C. office uses a WeWork office, and WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington D.C. D. C. staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington D.C. office has been converted to full staff telecommuting in line with the guidance measures we shared with the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have also been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="64">Those discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Some colleagues were exposed to telecommuting for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="66">Other long-time telecommuting colleagues would like to offer these colleagues some advice on how to adjust their work style:</seg>
<seg id="67">It is advisable to control the meeting time within one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If more time is required, please consider spreading the content of the meeting over multiple dates.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda of the meeting and send the reading materials in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">Use videoconferencing as the default mode of meeting, while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate and connect online.</seg>
<seg id="71">In each meeting, a moderator is assigned to lead the meeting, one person is assigned to monitor the questions in the chat window and track the changes in the speaker list, and another person is assigned to help with the minutes (or in a multi-person collaborative manner).</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need comfortable headphones, please send an email to contact the technical support department.</seg>
<seg id="73">Use your health allowance to buy snacks.</seg>
<seg id="74">Join the # remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues</seg>
<seg id="75">The HR operations team is working on ergonomic guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues become more productive during distributed office hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded public events such as Editor Pine before the WHO declared the outbreak over.</seg>
<seg id="77">These requests for cancellations and other restrictions may result in these community recipients not being able to complete their intended donation activities, and we have informed them that we understand this, while also promising that none of them will be penalized for postponing or modifying these goals.</seg>
<seg id="78">Over the next week, we will continue to provide additional guidance at community meetings and thematic community meetings in Wikimania and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="79">The global community now seems to be gripped by grief over the devastation of the outbreak, but it also reflects relief at being able to clearly keep an eye on their respective communities, Wikimedia and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the future, the CRT team will build a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and track how the community communicates with us.</seg>
<seg id="81">Keep in touch and communicate COVID-19 related issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We plan to hold a special staff meeting next week at 14:00 (Coordinated Universal Time) / 07:00 (Pacific Time) and we will send the relevant invitation to your calendar later.</seg>
<seg id="83">At the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for you to exchange and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are united in our dedication to help you here.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">The CRT team updates these pages in a timely manner and brings all the information together in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are seeking to maintain regular communication with our employees who live in countries / areas that are currently severely affected by the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="88">If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need help from others, please feel free to contact and work with the CRT team.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are here to wholeheartedly provide you with the support and contact you need.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Judan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.</seg>
<seg id="91">While we face these changes, we cannot afford to let go of our work and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, this outbreak has made us realize that we may now need to adjust our work and obligations in a way that we have not done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other as they continue to complete their work, to provide the support needed for our actions and to continue to bring to the world the services on which they depend.</seg>
<seg id="94">Only by planning at all times can we not be afraid of challenges.</seg>
<seg id="95">Now, please support each other and work together to create space for important work in the coming weeks and months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need everyone to contribute to make this happen, so please take care of yourself and your family to be at your best when needed.</seg>
<seg id="97">Finally, please remember to wash your hands frequently and do not touch your face.</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N) saluted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Need to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our team released the "2019 Rapid Recommended Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection," through which we provided experience and reference for the global response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, and based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest "COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Program (Seventh Edition)" issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out. At present, the disease has been officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was previously named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide, which was published online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, and based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released seven editions of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Program between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who have come up with a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guide and a valuable reference for this global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We acknowledge and thank them for this important work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Programme (Pilot Seventh Edition) and recent research.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of one epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis. In the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations need to be met:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) had a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) had a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections (positive nucleic acid test); (3) had a history of contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities that reported COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; and (4) had a history of contact with clustered confirmed cases (within 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms, in small areas with Q1 Q2 cases of fever and / or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced total leukocyte count and reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages of onset.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the suspected case, with any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 is positive; (2) the whole genome sequencing of the virus is highly homologous to the known new coronavirus; (3) the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 are positive in the serum test; or the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody changes from negative to positive, or the titration increases Q1 Q4 times in the recovery period, higher than in the acute phase.</seg>
<seg id="19">We can see that the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third edition (January 22, 2020) have added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood specimens.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020) added pathogenic testing of blood samples; after that, the seventh edition added serological evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">These modifications are based on the continued work of researchers studying the best nucleic acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway specimens, including blood collection. This increases the availability of different specimens and provides evidence for incorporating positive results from specific antibodies into the criteria for diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, there is a growing body of evidence alerting us to atypical and asymptomatic patients.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. Should be updated as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk."</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we hope more direct evidence emerges and appeal to readers for their views.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we recommend referring to and following the latest guidelines of the country where the case is located.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update our guidelines in time to help.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bangladesh reports 5 new COVID-19 deaths, a one-day high</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths of COVID-19 on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the highest number of deaths caused by the virus in a single day.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had recorded 114 confirmed cases of infection and 33 cured after rest at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">A cumulative total of 17 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an online news release, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDCR, said the deaths included four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Meerjady, there were two cases over the age of 60, two cases between the ages of 51-60 and one case between the ages of 41-50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also said that two of the patients who died were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.</seg>
<seg id="10">A hospital official told local news outlet Anadolu Agency that one of the dead patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, announced via online video that the suspension of public transport would be extended beyond the original plan to this Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was originally scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.</seg>
<seg id="13">Basic goods such as medical care, fuel and food can still be transported normally.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 8, of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and the other patient was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of March 19, all three patients had recovered.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not the danger level of a particular case, the WHO noted the need to urge the government to take measures:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries / regions can still change the course of this pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">If countries / regions test, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response, "said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction."</seg>
<seg id="7">The pandemic is "unprecedented," according to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Apart from influenza, no respiratory virus has been found to continue to spread globally since its emergence," he said in a comment on CNN in February.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a coronavirus-induced pandemic before."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Again, we've never seen a manageable viral pandemic before," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before entering the new state of pandemic, the WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "Most importantly, it's still getting worse."</seg>
<seg id="13">As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laboratory tests for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include: Detecting the presence of the virus and detecting whether antibodies are produced after infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR can detect the RNA of the coronavirus and determine the presence of the virus in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is specific to the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be used to determine if there has been a recent infection or if there is an active infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild, unreported or asymptomatic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results of this test can determine the exact fatality rate of the disease, as well as the level of herd immunity in the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country / region can provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of March 23, no country / region had tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests completed varied significantly from country to country / region.</seg>
<seg id="10">This discrepancy may also have a serious impact on the reported case mortality rate, which in some countries may be significantly overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test using a throat swab can only obtain reliable results if it is completed within the first week after infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR test using a pharyngeal swab can only get reliable results if it is completed within the first week after infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the virus disappears in the throat but continues to multiply in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">For those infected who are tested in the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a sputum straw, or a cough product (sputum) can be used.</seg>
<seg id="16">In January 2020, rRT-PCR, one of the early PCR tests, was released in Charite Hospital, Berlin, and became the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 23, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a Korean company, developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It looks for the "E" gene common to all Î² coronaviruses, as well as the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the State Drug Administration of China for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">An earlier version of the kit used three genetic assays, one of which was inconclusive due to a defective reagent, and a testing bottleneck at the Atlanta-based CDC; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed each day throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">The two-part test was not deemed reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The test was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization, and U. S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">LabCorp announced that RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide from March 5, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics also announced the availability of nationwide COVID-19 testing from March 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantity limit has been announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, COVID-19 testing is developed and produced by the National Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).</seg>
<seg id="26">On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federal Health Supervision Service. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test kit that can detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a test method of Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which can complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus enabling a device to carry out about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing using Abbott's m 2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, a test for Cepheid that takes about 45 minutes was also approved for emergency use by the FDA.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal amplification of nucleic acids in place of PCR.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the method does not require a series of temperature change cycles, a positive result can be obtained in only 5 minutes and a negative result can be determined in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production so that it can provide 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is developing a test using monoclonal antibodies (specifically bound to the new coronavirus' nuclear capsid protein (N protein)), which it hopes will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.</seg>
<seg id="32">A review of the literature in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chest tablets is small, and the performance of CT [computed tomography] may be obvious, even before symptoms appear."</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features of CT include double lung poly glazed shadow with peripheral asymmetry and posterior distribution.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, gravel pathways and pulmonary consolidation will develop.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the site of the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) showed that the sensitivity of CT is much higher than that of PCR, but the accuracy of CT is lower and many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommends that "CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Starting in March 2020, the CDC recommends the use of PCR for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections around seven days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population. The determination can be made in a central laboratory (CLT) or through immediate detection (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by a serial sample, it is usually determined using a peripheral blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, skin puncture is generally used to obtain a blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="42">The extraction step does not need to be performed before the determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the testing method declared by 29 entities that are now able to distribute their antibody testing kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one test under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the testing kits of Omon Medical Experimental Diagnostics AG and Epitope Diagnostics, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples, were approved in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="44">The detection capability can detect hundreds of samples in a few hours, so the detection speed of viral RNA is much faster than that of conventional PCR.</seg>
<seg id="45">In general, antibodies can be detected up to 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody testing kits it bought were good enough.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has set up a mechanism whereby suspected patients can live at home. "The emergency room provides the patient with a sample test tube." The patient spits saliva into the test tube and then sends the test tube back. The results will be received later. The NHS announced that it is piloting a home test scheme for suspected cases. This will eliminate the risk that patients will infect others when they go to the hospital. It will also eliminate the risk that patients will have to disinfect the ambulance after using the ambulance. In the case of COVID-19 suspected cases, medical professionals can take appropriate precautions to take samples.</seg>
<seg id="47">Drop-off testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive tests than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that non-resident institutions have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests a day, having tested 10,700 times in the previous week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the test is carried out at the request of the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the director of the German Robert Koch Institute, the total detection capacity in Germany is 160,000 copies per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of March 19, drop-off testing has been offered in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany is not known, as only those who have tested positive have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial laboratory survey showed that by the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) had been tested, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing 64 patient samples, namely, aggregating the samples and conducting further tests only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI Group temporarily established a 2,000-square-meter emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into operation on February 5, 2020 and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The laboratory, which was built in five days under the supervision of BGI Group founder Wang Jian, was modeled to show that Hubei's cases would have been 47% higher if it had not achieved the above detection capability, and the corresponding treatment and isolation costs would have doubled.</seg>
<seg id="54">Immediately after the Wuhan laboratory, the FireEye laboratory was set up in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai. At present, a total of 12 cities in China have set up the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the total daily flux of laboratory tests will be 50,000 copies per day. The open-source, multi-channel design released by Origami Assays can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 with just 93 measurements. These balanced designs can be operated in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid transporters.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents has become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the US.</seg>
<seg id="57">This has led some sponsors to explore sample preparation options that involve heating the sample to 98 Â°C (208 Â° F) for up to five minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that it has now tested more of its population for the new crown virus than any other country, and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="58">This capability can be achieved by using drive-through testing on the one hand, and by funding Group 42 and BGI Group (based on their "FireEye" emergency testing laboratories in China) to establish high-throughput laboratories to respond to the needs of large-scale population testing on the other.</seg>
<seg id="59">Built in 14 days and capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day, the laboratory is the first of its kind in the world to operate outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have all developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronavirus genetic map.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test kits, sending them to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until after January 28, limiting U. S. detection capabilities. Both China and the U. S. encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and both countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test kits to meet demand and the testing recommendations made by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">In contrast, experts say widespread testing in South Korea could help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the testing capacity built up by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization called for additional testing programs as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a huge demand for testing, which has led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has begun to become strained.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, testing kits developed by the CDC were "defective"; subsequently, the government removed bureaucratic hurdles that prevented private laboratory testing. Spain bought the kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found the results to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explained that the inaccurate test results could be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of test kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">Spain's cabinet said it would recycle the kits that returned the wrong results and replace them with another kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. Eighty percent of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China had incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China, which were found to be inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovic suggested the boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said the boxes Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use." The UK bought 3.5 million boxes from China and declared them unusable in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="71">Positive results can be obtained by conducting tests and isolating those who test positive and tracking the contact history of those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where Italy's first COVID-19 patient died, conducted two rounds of tests on a group of about 3,400 people, each about 10 days apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them tested positive and asymptomatic, and all cases found were quarantined.</seg>
<seg id="74">By imposing travel restrictions on the community, new infections were completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="75">By tracking contacts on a large scale, restricting inbound travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus infection rate in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries / regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictive measures, such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail premises.</seg>
<seg id="76">Singapore cancelled many activities and began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools resumed on time on March 23 after the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries / territories, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also managed to contain mass epidemics of the disease through mass tracking of contacts, restrictions on inbound travel, testing and quarantine, and less aggressive blockade measures.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that countries with more tests had lower case death rates relative to the number of deaths, possibly because they were better able to detect groups with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">The WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and limited national laboratory experience in handling COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the chart below, "test positive%" is affected by the testing policy of the country in which it is located.</seg>
<seg id="82">Other things being equal, countries that tested only hospitalized people had higher positive detection rates than countries that tested all citizens, whether or not they showed symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in the EU / EEA and the UK increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in various countries of the European Union / European Economic Area, as well as in the United Kingdom, shows similar trends, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly, although different countries are at different stages.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Italy's experience, the state, hospitals and intensive care units all need to be better prepared for the surge of COVID-19 patients, with the task of intensive care especially heavy.</seg>
<seg id="4">On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pathogen was a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence to date indicates that approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to critical and requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progresses to critical and requires intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in various countries of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with Hubei Province in China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and the UK with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cases of COVID-19 in EU / EEA countries and the UK</seg>
<seg id="13">After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has further expanded. At present, the dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the March 5, 2020 issue of the journal European Surveillance, Spiteri et al. Reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe based on the WHO case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the EU / EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020. The patients were returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU / EEA countries as well as the UK have detected COVID-19 cases. From 31 December to 15 March 2019, including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths have been reported in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Acquisition of cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases</seg>
<seg id="19">At 8:00 am each day, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention updates the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in every country in the world. They are obtained only through official sources, such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data have been used to assess EU / EEA and UK COVID-19 trends and compare them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU / EEA country and the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020 as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provided the total number of cumulative cases notified by each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared it with data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trends in COVID-19 in EU / EEA countries and the UK</seg>
<seg id="24">The trend of 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For the EU / EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February 2020 and then increased sharply around 28 February (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU / EEA countries, as well as in the UK, shows a similar increasing trend (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and the UK between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="28">It should be stressed that as of 8:00 am on March 15, the other 15 EU / EEA countries, as well as the UK, had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of cases of COVID-19 notified by the EU / EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the epidemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, cases may be defined differently from country to country, and options for selecting patients who must undergo COVID-19 diagnostic testing, including additional testing, vary.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected regions of Italy, about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, while media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU / EEA level, the available data is that only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases are hospitalized / or admitted to intensive care units, respectively (data not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and intermediate care beds available in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">The sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 modeled healthcare capacity saturation related scenarios and estimated the relationship between the prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 patients in each EU / EEA country and the UK and the risk of exceeding the number of intensive care beds by &gt; 90%.</seg>
<seg id="38">As cases have so far been clustered in EU / EEA countries as well as in certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population covered in the identified areas, it is advisable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of "Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2" (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries suggest that the EU / EEA and the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK are developing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, the State, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to cope with the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, especially in intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the rapid increase in the expected number of cases may leave policymakers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adjust the response if not implemented in advance.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a brief window of opportunity for countries to further increase controls to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU / EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zoonotic origin of human coronavirus</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutations and adaptations have been driving the co-evolution of Coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause minor illnesses, such as the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have turned the tables, revealing the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has once again brought CoV into the spotlight. Surprisingly, it is highly transmissible but less pathogenic than its sister virus, SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, so it will be helpful for us to understand the origin of zoonotic disease in HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoV is derived from bats and is non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">The intermediate storage hosts of some HCoVs are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human disease.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interactions of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we outline the existing knowledge of seven HCoV species, highlighting their discovery history, zoonotic origin and interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compared and controlled different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, we explore the current 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the requirements for successful host transformation and the impact of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="15">CoV belongs to the family Coronavirus and consists of a group of righteous single-stranded RNA viruses with envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing between 2.6 and 32,000 bases, and are known as "coronavirus" (CoV) due to their coronary form under electron microscopy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares similar tissues.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicating enzyme polymers.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polymers are further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1 ~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains the ORF of structural proteins, including prickles (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many line-specific helper proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="22">Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genera (Î±-CoV, Î²-CoV, Î³-CoV, and Î´-CoV), of which the Î²-CoV genus contains most HCoV and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV, while birds are the primary hosts of Î³-CoV and Î´-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, seven types of coronavirus (HCoV) are known to infect people.</seg>
<seg id="26">HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are Î±-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five Î²-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively large number of patients, and are more likely to develop into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions in people with the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, through extensive research on both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion that contracting HCoV was usually harmless was widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude fatality rate of about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">A decade later, after the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the disease continued to spread in Arabian Peninsula and sporadically to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The new 2019 HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has been raised and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoV species have zoonotic origins from bats, rats or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that all HCoV evolution originated in bats, where the virus was well-adapted and non-pathogenic, but exhibited great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world at large.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the zoonotic origin of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of viral species jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, it will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and expanded animal hosts, which is important for preventing future virus spills.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review, we outline the origin, interspecific transmission and pathogenesis of zoonosis in HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we highlight and explore a common theme that HCoV's parent viruses are not usually pathogenic in their natural storage hosts, but are pathogenic after transmission across species to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we reviewed trends in the evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before the HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from nasal secretions of people with the common cold, medical scientists had isolated different CoVs in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been found.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief chronological summary of the history of HCoV discoveries (table 1) would be informative and instructive.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infections and subsequently adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell line.</seg>
<seg id="51">People infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, while 10-20% of patients have fever, cough and other symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="52">In late 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent successive generations in the brains of suckling mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, and the symptoms are not significantly different from those of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus infection.</seg>
<seg id="54">HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in the winter in temperate climates.</seg>
<seg id="55">Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, after which they will develop for about two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="56">Healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop a mild common cold, according to a study of human volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a small number of patients with low immune function showed serious lower respiratory tract infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," is the first well-documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history. Its pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first case of SARS can be traced back to China's Guangdong Province in late 2002.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to the super transmitters, it is estimated that each case may bring about about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by advanced symptoms such as dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">Lymphocyte reduction, abnormal liver function examination and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory examination abnormalities in SARS.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, diffuse alveolar injury, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage increase were observed in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently required intensive care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in patients with low immune function.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the source patient who traveled from Canton to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study revealed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal specimen of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 has been linked to obstructive laryngitis, also known as Grubb laryngitis.</seg>
<seg id="76">That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma attacks.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four types of community-acquired HCoV have adapted well to humans and are usually less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases. But there have been accidents and unexplained causes, such as a rare, more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause serious lower respiratory infections in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, these HCoVs are also less virulent or pathogenic when they gain the ability to effectively spread and persist in humans.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although the majority of laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, secondary transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute renal failure, a characteristic unique to MERS in diseases hitherto caused by HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported, with a fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">In late December 2019, patients with cluster pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and were confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection by retrospective analysis.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude fatality rate of 3.4%.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is worth noting that the fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality rate outside Hubei is 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, cough and dyspnea.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also have diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster to different branches in the phylogenetic tree.</seg>
<seg id="96">Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic but more contagious.</seg>
<seg id="97">Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is in line with the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranged between SARS-CoV and four types of community-acquired HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit characteristics that are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small proportion of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, although the proportion is slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as transmissible as community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, like that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">Whether the fecal - oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays as important a role in SARS-CoV, at least in some cases, remains to be clarified in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission through human generations will have an important impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humans have also adapted well to these four types of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">Both HCoV, which causes serious illness in humans, and people with severe HCoV disease have died.</seg>
<seg id="115">To do this, HCoV must replicate enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to counter host limiting factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread among people, causing people with normal immune function to develop the common cold.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses don't need an animal host.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot be continuously transmitted in humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to survive and reproduce in zoonotic hosts and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and extended hosts.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">Whether it fully adapts to humans and circulates within humans without a host or intermediate animal host remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it is instructive to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and extended host.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homologous at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ancestral viruses are usually adaptable and non-pathogenic in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, storage hosts will continue to carry HCoV for long periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">In contrast, if HCoV is parasitic to an intermediate host soon after or immediately after, it will not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role in amplifying the host by allowing the virus to briefly replicate and then spread it to humans to increase the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">Terminal infections may occur if HCoV cannot sustain its transmission within an intermediate host.</seg>
<seg id="134">Conversely, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="136">A retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that indexed cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent seropositivity surveys showed higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in animal traders compared to the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">For the first time in a live animal market, civet cats and a cat have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.</seg>
<seg id="139">This view is indirectly supported by the fact that there have been no further SARS reports after the removal of all civets from the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, the report said that farm civets in the wild or not exposed to live animal markets tested largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that civets may only be intermediate amplifier hosts rather than natural hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals on the Canton market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a variety of small mammals may also act as intermediate expansion hosts for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="142">All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="143">Subsequent research on the natural animal hosts of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-associated chrysanthemum bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survives in chrysanthemum bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">The bats tested positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bat coronaviruses are 88-92% nucleotide sequence homologous with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the groundwork for the new concept of bats as hosts for emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, the researchers identified a variety of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus could be isolated as a live virus except for one designated WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="149">Experiments have shown that WIV1, taken from samples of bat faeces, uses bat, civet and human ACE2 as its receptor to enter cells.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although the two viruses are highly homologous, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not direct storage hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">Phylogenetic analysis placed MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.</seg>
<seg id="154">Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invade the virus using the same host receptor, dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPP4).</seg>
<seg id="155">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the corresponding RNA in bat Î²-CoV from Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV is only 87% nucleotide sequence homologous with its close relative, the bat CoV-HKU25.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, bats may not be direct storage hosts for MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that monoceros are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The live MERS-CoV isolated from the nasal swab of a single camel is identical to the virus found in humans, further indicating that the camel is the true storage host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also important to note that in camels with experimental MERS-CoV infection, the symptoms are generally mild, but a large number of virus shedding has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal route, which is also the main way for bats to transmit the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, problems remain because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed to human-to-human or unknown transmission routes, including unrecognized animal species carrying MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% nucleotide homologous with CoV RaTG13, a bat isolated from the chrysanthemum bat.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine parentage.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future, bats may not be direct storage hosts for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="167">It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts are among the wildlife species that should be sold and slaughtered at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market. Many of the initial COVID-19 cases have been linked to this, suggesting that animal-to-human transmission events may have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on macrogenome sequencing suggest that an endangered small mammal known as the pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry the ancestor Î²-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new pangolin coronavirus genomes are 85-92% nucleotide sequence homologous to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are just as closely related to RaTG13, being about 90% homologous at the nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="171">In the phylogenetic tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2-like virus subfamilies, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and is 97.4% amino acid sequence homologous.</seg>
<seg id="172">In stark contrast, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are even greater, despite their higher genome-wide sequence homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study of diseased pangolins also reported detection of viral overlap groups from lung samples, with similar results for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study used different assembly methods and manual processing to obtain a partial genome sequence that accounted for about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="175">We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to differences in the Î²-CoV sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the Î²-CoV associated with the pangolin SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="178">The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the Î²-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 associated with SARS-CoV-2 had the highest genome-wide sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly speculative that the high similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergent evolution.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another opposing view is that the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 associated Î²-CoV and RaTG13 recombine in a third wildlife species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driver of evolution, recombination is widespread in Î²-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="183">The origin of direct zoonosis of SARS-CoV-2 is still inconclusive.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</seg>
<seg id="185">Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronavirus, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have also been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">The report said that the bat coronavirus known as ARCoV. 2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in tricolor bats in North America showed a close association with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008), of which camelids are also suspected to be intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="188">For clarity, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="189">Phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for interspecific transmission events of HCoV throughout history.</seg>
<seg id="190">Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans across species from domestic animals, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="192">The bat Î±-CoV, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.</seg>
<seg id="193">An alpaca, Î±-CoV, appears between the two.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is multiple pieces of evidence supporting direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, not alpacas, may come into contact with bats in a common niche.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpacas.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, bat Î±-CoV associated with HCoV-229E was diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca Î±-CoV caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, no alpaca Î±-CoV was found in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E associated Î±-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra.</seg>
<seg id="201">It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Alternatively, although bat Î±-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and monoceros may be intermediate hosts for the transmission of the virus to humans, exactly as is the case with MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is a good illustration of interspecific transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats was known from its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries have reinforced this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">Apparently, bats provide a rich library of virus species for interspecific exchange and interspecific transmission of genetic fragments.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity and dense population, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal "virus transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the single hump for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It has adapted well to these camels, which have also gone from being intermediate hosts to stable natural storage hosts.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very mild disease in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and since it cannot be sustained, humans remain the terminal hosts of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="211">The role, if any, of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation is different from that of camels in MERS-CoV propagation.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangolin Î²-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be terminal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 related Î²-CoV, similar to the civet in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">Several possibilities for interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out in future studies.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, bats may be storage hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate expansion hosts for new invasions of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans contract the virus by slaughtering and eating game.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">There is a need for antibody surveys of livestock and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may recombine and adapt in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="222">Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side also play an important role in promoting coronavirus across the interspecies barrier.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation rate of coronavirus is estimated to be "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of about 10-4 times per year per locus 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to the new host.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronavirus has a proofreading activity of ribonucleic acid exosectase, and its deletion can lead to very high variability and attenuation, or even inability to survive.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this ribonucleic acid exosome and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.</seg>
<seg id="230">In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate is usually very high.</seg>
<seg id="231">Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating a higher adaptability to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Presumably, it has adapted to another host that is close to humans.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to monoceros.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to rapidly disable vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the larger RNA genome in coronaviruses has additional plasticity in the modification of gene mutation and recombination, thus increasing the possibility of interspecific collaborative evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are right.</seg>
<seg id="236">Evidence for this is provided by the large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions encoded towards the end of the genome 3 '.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique "replication selection" mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="238">In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, chain exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to produce new coronaviruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus-host interactions associated with transmission</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">Taking the recombination of SARS-CoV as a typical example, this paper shows the evidence of positive selection in interspecific propagation events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis of isolated strains of human and civet SARS-CoV, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially by mutating the S protein RBD to achieve this process.</seg>
<seg id="245">Typically, RBD in the coronavirus S protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened for host antibody responses.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids of the S1 segment, which bind to human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.</seg>
<seg id="247">The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, civet cats, mice and cats, allowing the virus to spread between species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only six amino acid residues distinct from human and civet virus isolates were observed in RBD, with four residues located in the receptor binding motif that interacts with the ACE2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="249">The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of civet SARS-CoV may increase the affinity of the fibrin to human ACE2 receptor interactions.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a cryo-electron microscopy study showed that this binding affinity is 10 to 20 times higher than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain the successful adaptation of the aforementioned coronavirus to humans after transmission across species from animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cellular receptors, the results of HCoV interspecific transmission are influenced by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">Differences in these host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as bats, camels and rodents may constitute barriers to interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">HCoV must deprive the host dependency factor and break the host constraint factor in order to successfully achieve interspecific transmission.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, molecular determinants in the important field of virus-host interactions have yet to be identified and characterized.</seg>
<seg id="262">Unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependencies and limiting factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may yield results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of a new HCoV: Back to square one</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bat coronavirus provides ample opportunity for the emergence of new types of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombination are drivers of HCoV evolution and two important steps in the process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could revolutionize the phenotype of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">In SARS-CoV helper proteins, the isolation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, but the discovery that they can encode different ORF8 proteins, led to the belief that ORF8 is important for adaptation in humans.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deletions of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains.</seg>
<seg id="270">This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host transformation.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV may have reorganized with the Î±-and Î³-CoV lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.</seg>
<seg id="272">Recombinant sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the prevalence of MERS-CoV has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in the Saudi Arabian humpback.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses recombine in their unstructured genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, which is likely due to the reduction of selection pressure on the host immune system and so on.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, where the deletion of dinucleotides leads to the deletion of full-length ORF4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca Î±-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a code shift mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by storage host selection pressures.</seg>
<seg id="279">After infection with coronavirus in bats, asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.</seg>
<seg id="280">From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to adapt well to coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathological changes triggered by the coronavirus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was inhibited due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity in bats can both inhibit coronavirus replication and can be proofed by the influence of ribonucleic acid exfoliation enzymes, thus providing selective pressure for high pathogenicity when the virus strain enters a new host.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also have evolved through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein signatures to adapt to the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">So it is no accident that three new types of HCoV have emerged in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">Coronavirus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They replicate in large numbers and do not elicit a strong host immune response.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is why asymptomatic carriers occur as well as leading to serious cases of infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="289">The onset of severe symptoms is mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage will be.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has decoupled from coronavirus replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy used to de-chain the immune response may play a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.</seg>
<seg id="292">The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory body activation in bats is defective.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory bodies may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes underlying the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although bat Î²-CoV has been found to be 95% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that is 96% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although civet cats and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">The pangolin Î²-CoV has been found to be clearly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts, or that the pangolin Î²-CoV may have contributed genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although doubts remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="301">Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus is back in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV zoonosis and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is substantial evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from human contact with civets in the market, closing the wet market and killing civets could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">Similarly, given the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin Î²-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet goods market to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="306">But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be further studied.</seg>
<seg id="307">MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around for a long time in monoceros.</seg>
<seg id="308">The camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for locals.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, following the example of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the recurrence of MERS, comprehensive measures should be taken in conjunction with other infection control measures to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.</seg>
<seg id="312">Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, which in turn can cause outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">Various zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, there is a high diversity of coronavirus in bats with zoonotic potential.</seg>
<seg id="315">There are many opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and / or deadly in humans in the future.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should formulate better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural hosts until there is a chance of spillover.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, then human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="321">Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans as well as future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">All in all, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural hosts of zoonotic viruses.</seg>
<seg id="323">There are still several missing pieces in the mystery of the origin of zoonosis in SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it makes sense to examine under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share the same niche.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats has yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, because many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection studies should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the case of bats, pangolins or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus is expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.</seg>
