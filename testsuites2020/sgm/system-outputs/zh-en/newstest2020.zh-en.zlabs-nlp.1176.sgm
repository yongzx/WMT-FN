<seg id="1">b'COVID-19 applications are mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, to help track close contacts, and to identify individuals who may have been in contact with the infected (the "contactor").</seg>
<seg id="2">A number of applications have been developed or introduced in some areas and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been established.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy has also raised concerns, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographic location of users of the application.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate this support for the Bluetooth application directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for their own access to COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">The program has now been used in more than 200 cities in China, and an application called TraceTogether has been introduced in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="9">The application was developed by the local IT community and released as an open source software and will be handed over to the government of North Macedonia with a blue teeth-based application, StopKorona!, to track the exposure of potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health of North Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On April 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking application was in advanced stages of development and that Ireland and France would be planning to launch a similar application (StopCovid) within the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering a similar application based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol, and Russia plans to introduce a geographic fence application for COVID-19 confirmed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed some practical problems that the application system might have, including false positive misstatements, and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population used the application.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to prevent the dissemination of misleading or harmful Crown Virus applications, Apple restricted the types of organizations that could publish Crown Virus-related applications in Apple Application Stores, i.e. to "official" or other reputable organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon imposed similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy defenders stated that they were concerned about large-scale surveillance of the use of coronary viral applications, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure established to respond to the coronary viral epidemic should be dismantled once the threat of the epidemic had been eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">These organizations declared eight conditions to be met by government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";</seg>
<seg id="21">Surveillance and surveillance extensions must have "sunset" clauses;</seg>
<seg id="22">The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined by law;</seg>
<seg id="26">Safeguards must be provided to prevent the misuse of data and to provide citizens with the right to deal with the misuse of data;</seg>
<seg id="27">All "relevant stakeholders" were required to be "effectively involved", including public health experts and marginalized groups, where the German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) also issued verification lists.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Google/Apple proposed plan is intended to address the issue of continuous monitoring and to remove it from the equipment operating system as soon as it is no longer necessary to track it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries use web-based rather than application-based location tracking, and users do not need to download applications, while avoiding being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="31">There may be serious privacy problems with network solutions that have access to raw location data.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with their own central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that communicate with one another using only the central server are now in place (see below for further details).</seg>
<seg id="33">Korea has introduced a system that is not based on applications to carry out contact tracking missions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using specialized applications, the system opted to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine these information to send notifications to potential infected persons through SMSs.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government was also allowed to make location information publicly available, as the country had made significant adjustments to its information privacy laws following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Public access to this information is available through many applications and websites, and some countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were studying privacy protection solutions, such as the use of BLE to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">PEPP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach and is not a single protocol containing a DPS proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a temporary contact number (TCN, formerly known as the contact event number, CEN), a privacy sensitive protocol and a mobile link tracking mechanism (PACT).</seg>
<seg id="40">Under these agreements, identifiable personal data will never be removed from the equipment, and all matches are carried out on the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The MIT Media Laboratory's Privacy Team has been developing the SafePaths Platform, which uses privacy protection techniques in the collection and use of location or path cross-data to track COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the Platform's research content development based on the White Paper "Application Lifidation: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Epidemic", released in March 2020, Enigma MPC, a company originally created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory and dedicated to the development of privacy technology, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.</seg>
<seg id="43">SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">On 5 April 2020, groups co-founded the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same approach and a largely overlapping agreement, with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alarm applications, which is a key to achieving wide application.</seg>
<seg id="45">On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that its official government applications were open source BlueTrace.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close contact tracking scheme, which claimed that it could protect privacy by combining Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy protection encryption.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they have published the core technical specifications used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be rolled out in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Launch of tools to support the Government in the creation of an official coronary virus tracking application that can protect privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">Direct integration of this feature into the iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plans to launch the system first by updating the operating system, which will also be removed after the outbreak threat.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleaning, is done to cleanse the hand of dust, grease, microbes or other unwanted material.</seg>
<seg id="2">At certain "critical moments" every day, the insistence on hand washing with soap prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be spread through excreta/mouth.</seg>
<seg id="3">If people do not wash their hands before contacting their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes), they may also be exposed to respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five key moments in a day must be wash with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's hip or urinary tablets, before feeding the child, before cooking, before and after handling the food, fish or poultry meat.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the absence of soap and water, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that hand-washing be carried out with grass ash:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after the preparation of food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after taking care of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="8">After replacement of urine or cleaning of hips such as toilet children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sneeze, cough or sneeze.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal food or animal excreta.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical personnel's manual hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand washing prior to dispensing or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field, the main purpose of handwashing is to remove from hand pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and chemical substances that may harm the human body or cause disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Handwashing is particularly important for people working in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">The benefits to health of hand washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other communicable diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">(c) Reduce the infant mortality rate at the time of delivery at home.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand-washing habits contributed slightly to an increase in the height of children under five years of age.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural change (e.g. hand washing with soap).</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple act reduces the death rate from the above-mentioned diseases by nearly 50 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">Advocacy for hand-washing interventions can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, with the effect of providing clean water sources in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hand-washing with soap reduces diarrhoea incidents by 48 per cent as a spontaneous act in households, schools and communities around the world, and hand-washing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (Acute Respiratory Infections, ARI).</seg>
<seg id="22">As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with about 1.8 million children killed each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children annually.</seg>
<seg id="24">The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) stated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, making pre- and post-toilet hand washing with soap saves more lives, reduces diarrhoea-related deaths by almost half, and reduces acute respiratory infections by one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, other health interventions are often accompanied by advocacy for hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing can also prevent seps herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hand washing has a minor adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing results in skin drying, causing skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin tickling, fractures, known as hand rubella or hand pneumonia, which is particularly common among health workers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsion (OCD).</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to reduce the excreta-mouth transmission of the disease, five key moments of hand-washing with soap are essential in one day: after latrines (diabetes, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of children (replacement of urine), before feeding the child, before cooking and before or after handling the food, fish or poultry meat.</seg>
<seg id="31">In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing should also be carried out in the correct manner: before and after handling a cut or wound; after sneeze, cough or nose; after touching animal excreta or treating animals; and after touching with garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">Hand washing with soap is very low in many countries/regions.</seg>
<seg id="33">A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7 per cent of households had the highest rate of soap washing in Saudi Arabia, at 97 per cent; the United States was close to the average, at 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate, at 23 per cent, and various behaviour-change methods were now in place to promote hand washing with soap at critical times, with developing countries choosing to allow schoolchildren to target collective hand washing on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Philippine Department of Education's "Basic Health Plan" is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">The centrepiece of this national plan is two deworming per year, supported by hand washing with soap and teeth painted with fluorinated toothpaste every day.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, the plan has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">The inclusion of soap or cleaning agents in water would allow better removal of microorganisms from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The primary role of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce solubility barriers and increase solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Water alone is not able to clean the skin effectively, as fat and proteins (components of organic soil) are not soluble in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, clean hand washing requires reasonable water ...</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid soap, because it can be reused, may retain bacteria left in previous use.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because bacteria would be washed away by foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, CDC stated that "it would be preferable to select non-exposure liquid soap".</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted in the health-conscious public.</seg>
<seg id="45">To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistant microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antibiotics or disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antimicrobial agents such as trichloro sand, which has a large number of resistant microbial strains.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, bacterial soap, even if not selected for antibiotic resistance strains, may not be as effective as publicity.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skin-guardants, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acid, necrostic acid, lactactic acid), antimicrobial activated phenyl acids, and more skin modulants (aloe, vitamins, thinchol, plant extraction) which are used as pH regulators, and a comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that soap is the same as antibacterial soap in the prevention of disease and the removal of bacteria on hand.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water washers were comfortable, but their heat was not enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria breed very rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, soap water is more effective than soap water in the removal of natural grease containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific research has confirmed that the use of temperature water has no effect on the reduction of microorganisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.</seg>
<seg id="53">The water-free hand washing or bacteria-free hand washing is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-hydraulic hand cleaning agents (also known as wine washing, free washing, or free washing) were popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most formulations of this type of hand washing fluid contain isopropanol or ethanol, adding dense agents such as kapom (propylene polymers) to form gels, or forming liquids with humidants such as glycerine, or with foams to make them easy to use and to alleviate the skin drying caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity by containing at least 60% to 95% of alcohol free wash-free hand fluids.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wastes can kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (methoxyxylene golden yellow vococcus (MRSA) and anti-macillus intestinal bacteria (VRE)), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell viruses (RSV), nose viruses, pox, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.</seg>
<seg id="58">After 30 seconds with 70% alcohol, 99.97% of the bacteria on the hand (a decrease of 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 pieces) can be killed, and the bacteria on the hand can be reduced by 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) after 1 minute, which is most effective for bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="59">Viruses such as norovirus (Norwalk, Norwalk) (the most common cause of gastrointestinal inflammation) have almost no effect and must be used with sufficient free bacterial washing or alcohol washing fluids to completely wet or cover both hands.</seg>
<seg id="60">The rhinning of the heart and back and fingers and the end of all fingers is about 30 seconds until liquids, foams or gels are dried.</seg>
<seg id="61">The fingerpipe must also be fully cleaned, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that hand washing be preferably, rather than using wash-free hand, especially when it looks dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Such washing fluids are increasingly used because they are easy to use and can quickly render microorganisms inactive; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.</seg>
<seg id="63">The frequent use of alcohol free hand washing fluids can result in skin drying unless the formulation is accompanied by a lubricant and/or wet agent.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerine and/or other lubricants may be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate the dermal drying caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="65">In clinical trials, alcohol free washing fluids containing skin can significantly reduce skin irritation and skin drying compared to soap or antimicrobial cleaning agent.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic exposure to skin inflammation, exposure to nettles syndrome or additive sensitization to alcohol or alcoholic washing in hand fluids is rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">Alcohol is less likely to be free from hand washing than hand washing with soap and water, which is an attractive reason.</seg>
<seg id="68">The water-free cleaning agent, while effective, does not remove organic matter from the hand but only disinfects it.</seg>
<seg id="69">As a result, free hand washing is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, which are still in hand.</seg>
<seg id="70">The efficacy of unalcohol-free hand washing and washing fluids depends to a large extent on the composition and formulations, which have historically been much worse than those of alcohol and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="71">Recently, formulations using benzachlorammonium have been shown to be persistent, cumulative, antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced effects after repeated use, possibly due to a gradual adverse skin reaction.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many in low-income communities are unable to afford soap and can be replaced with ash or soil.</seg>
<seg id="73">Grass ash or soil is better than separate hand washing with water, but not as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems that exists is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like soap, herb ash is a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution after encountering water.</seg>
<seg id="76">WHO suggests that where there is no soap available, weed ash or sand could be used instead of soap.</seg>
<seg id="77">The correct hand-washing approach recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wetters with flowing temperate or cool water.</seg>
<seg id="79">The proposed use of run-off water is due to the potential contamination of stereo basins, which seem to be of little relevance.</seg>
<seg id="80">A sufficient amount of soap wash repeatedly to produce foams and wash hands, fingers, and fingers.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap can remove bacteria from the skin, and research has shown that people are often more thoroughly washing hand with soap than with separate water.</seg>
<seg id="82">At least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">The washing can produce friction, which can help remove bacteria from the skin, the longer the washing time, the more bacteria are removed.</seg>
<seg id="84">Full cleaning with run-off water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Hand-washing from water basins can cause re-contamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry with a clean towel or naturally dry.</seg>
<seg id="87">Hand moisture is more susceptible to re-contaminated thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial fingernails and fractured fingernails may hide microorganisms.</seg>
<seg id="89">It is generally recommended to use wet milk to avoid hand drying; skin drying results in skin damage, which increases the risk of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">Low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing where access to piped water and/or soap is not available in developing countries, for example, through a hanging barrel or holes of cucurbits and/or the use of ash to wash hands (where water supply is limited (for example, in schools or rural areas in developing countries), where necessary, water-saving hand-washing programmes, such as improvised water taps and other low-cost methods.</seg>
<seg id="91">The improvised tap is simple, hanging a water tank with a rope and then dumping a small amount of water on the hand through a pedal plate and then using soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Effective hand friction is an important step in the manual health process, but there is some controversy about the most effective way of doing it in public health.</seg>
<seg id="93">An increasing number of studies have shown that the towel is more hygienic than many electric dry mobile phones provided by the toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the turban industry, comparing the sanitary aspects of the turban, the heating cell phone and the more modern jet dry phone.</seg>
<seg id="95">After hand washing using heating dry phones to dry both hands, it was found that the total bacteria on the finger had increased by an average of 194 per cent and the bacteria on the hand hand had increased by an average of 254 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="96">The number of bacteria on fingers increased on average by 42 per cent, while the number of bacteria on hand hands increased by 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="97">After hand washing, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers was reduced by an average of 76 per cent, and the total number of bacteria on hand was reduced by an average of 77 per cent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various methods of handwork could cause cross-infection among other inter-sanitary users and inter-sanitary facilities.</seg>
<seg id="98">Jet dry mobile phones are said to have sprayed air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph) and to be able to blow off microorganisms on hand and body, potentially contaminating other inter-sanitary users and inter-sanitary facilities up to 2 m.</seg>
<seg id="99">The use of heating dry phones can spread microorganisms to 0.25 metres outside dry phones.</seg>
<seg id="100">In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different methods of drying.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involved a large number of different producers of dry phones, which were compared with handwritten handlers.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the absence of soap and water during travel, the hand washing with a hand-destroyed wet towel.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol content should be at least 60% free of hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="105">Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of disease in the hospital, but only a long time later required a medical officer to carry out hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="106">The hospital uses electronic equipment that provides feedback to alert hospital staff when they are forgotten to wash hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">A study found that the rate of infection following the use of these equipment had decreased.</seg>
<seg id="108">The hand washing by medical personnel lasted at least 15 seconds, using sufficient soap and water or gels to produce foams and wash the hand parts.</seg>
<seg id="109">The fingers are shared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there are residues between nail stitches, they can be removed by hard brush.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since the remaining water on hand may still be bacteria, it must be fully cleaned and dried with a clean towel.</seg>
<seg id="112">When effected, the tapes should be used to close the tapes (where necessary, the turban should be used to open the export door).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents the re-pollution of the hand through exposure to these surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="114">In health facilities, hand washing is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoiding transmission.</seg>
<seg id="115">Reports in the New England Journal of Medicine indicate that hand washing is still not at acceptable levels in most medical settings and that a large number of health-care workers often forgot their hand washing before reaching patients, leading to microbiological transmission.</seg>
<seg id="116">A study showed that proper hand washing, together with other simple procedures, could reduce the rate of blood flow infection associated with the tube by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a working paper demonstrating the standard hand washing and washing methods in medical institutions.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization has also published a draft manual health guide on its website for public comment.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby et al. provided relevant overviews.</seg>
<seg id="119">Commercial equipment can measure and validate manual hygiene if compliance with the regulations is required.</seg>
<seg id="120">The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" for hand washing:</seg>
<seg id="121">After exposure to blood/body</seg>
<seg id="122">Prior to and prior to sterile operation</seg>
<seg id="123">Antimicrobial chemicals are added to soap ("soap" or "bacterial soap") after caring for the patient, which can result in bacterial effects from hand washing agents.</seg>
<seg id="124">Such bacteria may be required to "wash" hands for surgery before surgery or in environments with a large number of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, with water taps, chlorine or iodine-containing hand washing fluids that can be opened and closed without contact, hand washing without a bacterial scarf to dry hand, bacteria-free brush and other bacteria-free tools to clean nails.</seg>
<seg id="125">All jewellery should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires the cleaning of hands and forearm up to elbows, usually for 2–6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">There is no need for long-duration washing (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When washing, the water in the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="129">After the hand washing, the hand was fricted with an unbacterial cloth and the surgical clothes were worn.</seg>
<seg id="130">In order to reduce bacterial transmission, hand washing or hand washing fluids free of bacteria are preferable before and after contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">In order to control vineball infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from cleaning hand is from 20% hand washing, and further benefits are very limited when the cleaning hand is increased to more than 35%.</seg>
<seg id="132">The use of general soap-washing results in a more than threefold increase in the proportion of bacterial infections transmitted to food, compared with the use of wine hand washers (30 seconds) and bacterial washing with bacterial soap, respectively, and the use of alcohol washing hand bacteria is found to be 26 per cent lower than the use of bacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, interventions such as reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus on hand and Clostridium couile spores, which are more effective in soap and water than in alcoholic hand washing, increasing the supply of wine washing hand, and written and verbal alerts to employees, can improve the health of health care facilities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">Hand-washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good physical health and even nutrition in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to universal access to hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is rare to have hand-washing tapes in each private or near a sanitation room, even with cheap methods for the construction of hand-washing desks.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, low handwashing frequency may also be due to entrenched habits, not due to lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">The promotion and promotion of hand-washing using soap can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.</seg>
<seg id="140">To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) a community-based approach was effective in increasing hand washing, and that social marketing activities were less effective in advocating hand washing in schools, an example of a "three-star approach" promoted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which, among other health requirements, encouraged schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students were soap.</seg>
<seg id="142">When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the top three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand-washing promotion activities could include the construction of hand-washing desks to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of a hand-washing awareness campaign is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to bring about behavioural change due to the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, and UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing symbolic.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing and the avoidance of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, it has been reported that advocacy for hand-washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.</seg>
<seg id="147">The first to recognise the importance of hand washing to human health—particularly to those who are weak (for example, mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in the hospital), two pioneers in the field of hand health in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing science in the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the odor known as miasma.</seg>
<seg id="149">The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in promoting manual hygiene, emphasizing manual hygiene as an important means of preventing transmission of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The 2009 swine influenza outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">For example, German posters with "correct hand-washing methods" are displayed next to the public health room, the office building and the bathing pool at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="152">The term "washing hands" means that a person declares that he or she is unwilling to take responsibility for something or not to take part in it.</seg>
<seg id="153">It originated from the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible, where Pontius Pilate baptized his hands after deciding to nail Jesus, and later evolved into a wide range of English-speaking communities.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to force sex to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse her imagined sludge, indicating that she was guilty of her own crimes and abetting her husband to commit them.</seg>
<seg id="155">Research has shown that people who think of or conceive of immoral behaviour tend to wash hands more frequently than others and often value hand washing facilities more.</seg>
<seg id="156">In addition, it is unlikely that those who may be able to wash their hands after the assumption of immoral behavior will engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteerism.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion requires hand washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes, but not with soap, is part of many religious symbols, including Baha'i, Hindu, Jewish ablution (tevilah) andnetilat yadayim (netilat), Christian hand washing, and sanitary hand washing, especially after certain acts.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing, such as toilets.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, killing more than 3,000 people and causing a huge human disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to its homologue virus SARS-CoV, which in 2003 caused tens of thousands of people to become infected with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats, and similar symptoms may be caused by similar mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Although COVID-19 is less severe and less mortality than SARS, it is more widespread, affecting more older persons than young people and more men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase in the number of publications related to the new crown pneumonia, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving subject of research.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will share basic knowledge of the epidemiology, causes, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this synthesis will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">On January 25, 2020, the Spring Festival became an unprecedented and insensitive memory of Chinese people, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced all people to leave their homes for the whole holiday and the weeks that followed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The virus is highly homogeneous with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of the coronary virus (CoV) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the related disease was referred to as coronary viral disease-19 (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 had died.</seg>
<seg id="11">WHO warns COVID-19 that it has become the "first public enemy" and that its threat may exceed that of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 on virology, epidemiology, causeology, diagnosis and treatment have been published in less than two months since 7 January 2020, when the first report separated the virus from several patients.</seg>
<seg id="13">The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research in this emerging area of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far about the prevention of the disease and its future development, as well as some urgent issues that remain to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">CoV has historically been considered a non-lethal pathogen of humans, mainly causing about 15% of common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this century has already seen two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, rapidly spreading to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak was the third in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in figure 1, the city of Wuhan first reported several cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons to the National Board of Health and Health of China on 31 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, CoV sequences were announced.</seg>
<seg id="21">On 15 January 2020, Wuhan reported his first death.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">On 20 January, infections by health-care personnel were reported, indicating the possibility of human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 23 January, the city of Wuhan closed down all public transport.</seg>
<seg id="25">On 24 January, the first clinical study of neopneumonia was conducted, with only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases having direct contact with the Wuhanhuahua South Seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point for an unknown animal source of infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency".</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time of publication of the present report, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (fig. 2 (Fig.2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Owing to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final extent and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">On 11 February 2020, a multi-central study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an update of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="32">SARS-CoV-2 More males (0.31/10,000) than females (0.27/10,000).</seg>
<seg id="33">COVID-19 is concentrated in and around Hubei.</seg>
<seg id="34">COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from morbidity to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average latency period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from illness to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected persons increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the mass population movements that preceded China's spring festival.</seg>
<seg id="39">The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent) for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="40">The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60 years) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">CoV is a large family of membrane viruses containing a single justice chain RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four genera, i.e. α, β, γ and δ, where α-CoV and β-CoV are known to be infected with humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's membrane glycoprotein (S) binds to their cell receptor vascular thinase conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide enzyme 4 (DPP4) followed by membrane fusion.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus RNA genome is released to the cytomy; after the genome of the virus is replicated, the genome RNA forms the viral-containing capsule together with the membrane glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein, and then merges with the membrane to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="46">As a result, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequential samples collected from the Wuhan South China Seafood market at the initial eruption site.</seg>
<seg id="47">In contrast to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="48">SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in over-thin slices on the human air lanes through ejection electron microscopy.</seg>
<seg id="49">ACE2 was found to be the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is less binding to the human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients is less severe than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="51">SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new type of short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.</seg>
<seg id="52">The SARS-CoV-2 or f3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, anorf8 does not contain any known functional domain or base sequence.</seg>
<seg id="53">On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported a cold electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure with an amino acid trans-shipment protein B0AT1 that formed a complex with ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex had open and closed elephants and was assembled into binary polymers, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0AT1 may be a treatment target for drug screening to discourage SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origins and Intermediate Hosts</seg>
<seg id="57">It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate from bats and are transmitted to humans via fruits and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems development, the bats are considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is consistent with two SARS models CoV, the bat-SL-CoVZX45 and the bat-SL-CoVZX21 respectively.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is not clear what intermediate hosts will help the virus to infect humans across species barriers and how it will spread has yet to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Ji et al. suggested that snakes were from bats to human viral carriers, which involved homologous reshaping within S proteins.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that since a CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were found to have 99% gene homogeneous properties in jan armour-piercing, a long-kiss mirex, often used in Chinese medicine, the jan armor-piercing was a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1% difference between the two genomes remains significant; therefore, decisive results are yet to be provided by specific evidence (Fig.33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The rational nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.</seg>
<seg id="64">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for 48 hours and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="66">SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat – 56 °C 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can effectively extinguish viruses, but chlorine is no longer effective.</seg>
<seg id="67">Human immunizations for SARS-CoV-2 are generally lacking, making the new virus susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="68">At present, no detailed research has been reported on the immunization response of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).4).</seg>
<seg id="70">In general, the virus is first identified by the host's intrinsic immune system by mode recognition receptor (PRR), including C-type condenser sample receptor, Toll sample receptor (TLR), NOD sample receptor (NLR), and RIG-I sample receptor (RLR).</seg>
<seg id="71">Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression through different pathways, tree synaptic cell maturity, and I-type jamming (IFN), which limit the transmission of viruses and accelerate giant phagocytophage in viral antigens.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, SARS-CoV's N protein can help free the virus from immune response.</seg>
<seg id="73">Adaptive immunizations promise to be added to the anti-virus response shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="74">T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">CD4+ T Cell Stimulation B cells produce viral specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells kill viral infected cells directly.</seg>
<seg id="76">Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help these defensive cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis in T cells.</seg>
<seg id="78">Hydraulic immunizations, including recharges such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, are also essential for resistance to viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies separated from rehabilitated patients can be neutralized with MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the immune system produces a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lung and other organs and, in the worst cases, multi-organ failure or even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by agglomerative morbidity are more likely to affect older persons with multiple complications and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">Often, individuals exposed to large numbers of viruses or impaired immune functions are more likely to be infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study of the first 425 cases in the city of Wuhan, the average latency of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average latency of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As mentioned earlier, a recent study shows a latency period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days according to demographics of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective time of separation to the most accurate latency period so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to other people with asymptomatic infections.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a rule, a virus contact or infected person usually needs to be segregated for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the period of isolation be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Heating is usually the primary and first symptoms of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no other symptoms, such as whooping cough, aerosis, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, pharynx pain, aldicarb, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients experience respiratory difficulties and/or hypoxia a week after the illness.</seg>
<seg id="91">Acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and condensation disorders are rapidly advanced.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even in the absence of pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with heat and/or respiratory symptoms and acute heat should undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were: heat, 98%, whooping cough, 76%, breathing difficulties, 55%, diarrhoea, 3%; and that 8% of patients needed air support.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on family agglomeration and individual transmission without symptoms leading to agglomeration.</seg>
<seg id="95">In comparison, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered from heat (98 per cent), whooping cough (47 per cent) and breathing difficulties (55 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80% of these patients require air support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which corresponds to the higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and pharynx pain (21 per cent) were also observed in MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">Among SARS patients, heat (99% - 100%), whooping cough (29% - 75%), breathing difficulties (40 - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and pharynx (13 - 25%) have been shown to be the main symptoms, with around 14 - 20% requiring air support.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of 14 February, 66,576 cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed globally and the mortality rate was 2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="100">By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="101">For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="102">An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47,95% confidence intervals (CI) 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with regard to symptoms, mortality and R0.</seg>
<seg id="104">The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher diffusion capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, control of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="106">The incidence of agglomeration usually occurs in the same household or from the same gathering or transport, such as cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="107">The patient usually has a travel or residence history in Wuhan or other areas of the epidemic within the last two weeks prior to the occurrence of the disease, or a history of close contact with the infected person or patient.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that treated patients who had been discharged could carry the virus again, thereby alerting that the isolation would be extended.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of hematocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the outer perimeter of the patient during the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, white cell counts &amp; lt were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients; 4×109/L – including lymphocyte counts &amp; lt; 1×109/L – lymphocyte abnormalities, elevated winter amino acid transfer enzyme levels and viral blood disorders.</seg>
<seg id="111">Some patients see elevated levels of liver enzymes and muscle enzymes and muscle protein in the blood, and most patients see elevated blood C reaction protein and blood sinking.</seg>
<seg id="112">Heavy patients see increased levels of D-di polymers and a decrease in lymphocyte counts.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most COVID-19 patients see chest imaging abnormalities characterized by double-side spot shadows or lung glass glass.</seg>
<seg id="114">Atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and Type II pulmonary bubble epithelial disorders reduce surface activist levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">As a result, the worst chest imaging has been found to occur at the same time as the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="118">On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis of a patient who died of the disease found a lung bubble detachment, transparent membrane formation, meso-lymphocyte immersion, and poly nucleoplastic cell cells consistent with viral infections and ARDS pathology, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 by reversing the RT-PCR.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, as the high pseudo-negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical expression for diagnosis (and no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) on February 13, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation occurred when SARS was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical performance, laboratory examination and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Peak team reported a program to test SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which did not require a complex instrument to detect a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA section with a test paper with concentrations of only 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (per litre 10 - 100 viral copies) in less than one hour.</seg>
<seg id="124">If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to the lack of experience in treating new CoVs, doctors mainly provide support for COVID-19 patients, while trying to treat or propose various treatments for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These include current and potential treatments such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicines and psychological support for rehabilitated patients.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended that the blood plasma of the rehabilitated patient be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">The pharmaceutical company is competing to develop antibody and vaccine against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">SARS-CoV-2 initially primarily attacked the lungs and may also express other organs of ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys, to a lesser extent.</seg>
<seg id="130">Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and depletion are the main threats to patients and the leading cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Respiratory support, therefore, is essential for alleviating symptoms and saving lives, including routine oxygen absorption, high flow oxygen absorption, unintended gas and creative mechanical flux, depending on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive in vitro membrane oxygen (ECMO) support, an improved cardiac pulmonary bypass technique for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, maintaining the electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock and protecting vital organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is well known that SARS and MERS patients have excessive immune system reactions leading to cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storms are a form of all-body inflammation response characterized by a number of cellular factors released, including TNF alpha, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFNγ and MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main causes of ARDS and polyorgan depletion.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="138">The cortex steroids and pearl-only antibodies, an IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storms include: regulation of T-cell targeted immunosupply responses; interruption of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; Bona vomiting; cytokine signal transduction inhibitors4; and HDAC inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, large doses of steroids do not benefit from serious lung damage to SARS and COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">On the contrary, they may cause serious side effects, particularly the loss of blood-deficient bones, which can seriously affect anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nevertheless, short-range treatment for CVID-19 patients with low and medium doses of corticosterol is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, the existence of effective antiretroviral therapy had not been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, it has been found that Ridsewe, a nucleotide analogue, has been effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Ridsewe is a new antivirus drug developed by Gillid, initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, it was also shown that Ridsewe could inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, Gillid has supplied the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected people, the results of which are promising.</seg>
<seg id="149">Potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have also been proposed for Barricotini, α-interferin, Lopinaway/Litonaway and Libawelin.</seg>
<seg id="150">Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur as a result of joint Lopinaway/Litonaway treatment.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Blood plasma and antibodies from rehabilitated patients</seg>
<seg id="153">There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of healthy individuals from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="154">In practice, rehabilitated patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies for pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immune globular protein (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes against pathogens and other heterosexuals, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this principle, plasma was collected in the blood of a group of rehabilitated COVID-19 patients and then injected to 10 critical patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, with a decrease in inflammation and viral vectors and an increase in oxygen saturation.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, prior to the development of special treatment, it would be necessary to validate and clarify methods that could be used on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">In addition, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered in the light of the effects of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune reactions and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may endanger life.</seg>
<seg id="161">Antibody concentrations in the blood are generally low, and there is a high demand for plasma treatment for people at risk.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to combat a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Therefore, it is more critical and practical to separate B cells from rehabilitated patients and to identify genetic passwords encoding effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies for the proteins necessary for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily scale up antibody production.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, it has been thousands of years since TCM was used to treat multiple diseases.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, the efficacy of the treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of various components in the prescription, which varies according to the TCM theory.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate such ingredients or their optimal combinations.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19 has made TCM one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe phase.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, it has been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment in the case of ventilation poisonous capsules and blue plague capsules.</seg>
<seg id="170">In several provinces of China, 87% of patients used TCM treatment, with the highest rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM treatment, with the lowest rate of treatment (13%).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influential factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On February 18, 2020, Chamberley and his co-workers published a study on comparative Western medicine (WM) separate treatment and joint treatment with WM and TCM.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the WM+TCM group temperature recovery, dissipation of symptoms and hospitalization took a significantly shorter time than the simple WM group.</seg>
<seg id="174">The most impressive is that the WM+TCM group has significantly less symptomatic deterioration (from light to heavy) than the simple WM group (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent), and the WM+TCM group also has less mortality than the simple WM group (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still requires higher-quality control tests, greater scope and more centres.</seg>
<seg id="176">Specification of the mechanism for the operation of TCM treatment or its combination and, where possible, the elaboration of its effective components would also be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are highly frightened by this highly infectious and even deadly disease, and those who are segregated are bitter, lonely and angry.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection, such as heat, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as ill-treated reactions, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychological reactions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, horror, psychoactive excitement, psychotic symptoms, pretence and even suicide.</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can increase anxiety and guilt about the effects of transmission, segregation and stigmatization on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mental health care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain from animal hosts and infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often used as an additional means of antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">The industry has made efforts to develop S-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective medium- and antibodies and/or protected immunizations for SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="185">The vivo vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, the in-body effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models and their protective effect on human and animal co-infection has not been determined prior to the initiation of clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is likely due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">By contrast, the persistence of common human and livestock sources in the affected areas has led to the persistence of sporadic and concentrated MERS cases in the Middle East and their transmission to other regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed through the use of live viruses, DNA particles, viral carriers, nanoparticles, viral samples and restructured protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.</seg>
<seg id="190">The development of a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long period required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamics of CoV.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show complete clinical processes in thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can be gradually rehabilitated without any after-effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 sufferers have high morbidity and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, the establishment of prognosis models for this disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or relevance of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: Age is the most important factor influencing SARS prognosis, as is COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="198">As mentioned earlier, in a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurs mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% are over 50 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have basic complications and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need intensive care (the median age is 66 years versus 51 years), indicating that the age of COVID-19 is a predetermined factor in the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="200">Sex: As mentioned above, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/10,000 versus 0.27/10,000).</seg>
<seg id="201">Syndrome and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and heart disorders.</seg>
<seg id="202">The heart incident was also the leading cause of SARS deaths.</seg>
<seg id="203">SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with ACE2 positive cholester cells, which may lead to liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is noteworthy that age is closely linked to underlying diseases and may interact with each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Abnormal laboratory inspection results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been considered as a potential prognosis factor for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery.</seg>
<seg id="206">It has also been suggested that the CRP level is related to the severity of COVID-19 and its pre-existing relevance.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sky winter amino acid transfer enzymes (AST), amino acetine transfer enzymes (ALT) and muscle kinases (CK) may also contribute to predicting endings.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.</seg>
<seg id="209">As such, they are a traditional symbol of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Main clinical symptoms: The timing of chest imaging examination and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict COVID-19 terminals and complications.</seg>
<seg id="211">The use of steroids: As previously mentioned, steroids are immune inhibitors and are commonly used as auxiliary treatment for communicable diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">As large doses of corticosteroids are widely used for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from hypoxia, resulting in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients at small doses and for short periods, if needed.</seg>
<seg id="214">Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under severe stress, as they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of relatives and patients.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients recover from stress and resume their normal lives.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to differ from those of SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or non-symptoms at an early stage of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="218">As a result, infected persons can produce large numbers of viruses in the early stages of the disease or during the latent period during the course of their daily activities, which makes it difficult to control the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when the patient's condition is serious and most of the transmission does not occur at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="220">As a result, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently making great efforts, including blocking Wuhan and its surrounding cities and continuing isolation of almost all its population, with a view to interrupting the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="222">Although these measures have caused serious economic and other damage to China, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the rate of development of the epidemic is slowing.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the downward phase will last three to four months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, other experts were less optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19 was significantly more contagious than SARS and would not end in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Longini et al. developed models for predicting the consequences of the epidemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could be infected by two thirds of the world's population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both middle nasal and swabs in patients recovering and discharged prior to the week, suggesting that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, there are encouraging signs in China that current strategies may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Ebola virus has been predicted to lead to 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through strict isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection may weaken, eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses co-existing with humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).</seg>
<seg id="233">SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, possibly even through direct contact with items contaminated by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in the faeces, increasing the likelihood of its spread in the faeces.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of which may have been caused by in-hospital infections, included 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="236">Therefore, closer preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or infected person.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) helps to control the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people from being transported in the air or adhered to surfaces of objects that may be passed on to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is about 85 nm.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since the virus particles can even penetrate five co-folding surgical masks, medical personnel in direct contact with the patient must wear N95 (1860s series) masks rather than surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear segregated clothing to further reduce exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also be transmitted via the eye.</seg>
<seg id="243">On 22 January 2020, a doctor with N95 masks contracted SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have been inflammated through his eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or glasses in the face of patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the general public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use disinfected soap to wash hand more frequently than usual, remain indoors isolated as much as possible and limit contact with potential infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three feet are thought to be an appropriate distance away from the patient.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are an effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, its highly homogeneous nature with SARS-CoV was reported on January 7, 2020, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan City Centers for Disease Prevention and Control remained reassured, indicating that the transmission of the new virus was low, that there was limited human transmission and that the epidemic was manageable.</seg>
<seg id="250">The news clearly eased the public's vigilance, and on the eve of the spring it was missed to contain the epidemic at the key node of Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these bodies should (1) be more cautious in issuing bulletins, since each word is essential for citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) control potential epidemics more strictly in the early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve the social response system.</seg>
<seg id="253">The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, it had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe in less than two months.</seg>
<seg id="255">Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, COVID-19 outbreaks appear to re-emerge like SARS.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">COVID-19 affects more older persons than young people, more men than women, and older patients are more severe and have higher mortality rates than young patients.</seg>
<seg id="258">The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients still transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually do not transmit the virus until the severity of their condition, making it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.</seg>
<seg id="260">This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="261">In some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 routine RNA tests may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, patients who have been cured may be re-positive.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Given the rapidity of the study on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:</seg>
<seg id="265">Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Although 96% of the gene homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat SARS samples CoV, we could not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from the bat.</seg>
<seg id="267">Which animal is to transmit the virus from the original host, hypothetical bats, to the intermediate host of humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">If the answers to questions 1 and 2 are not known, we will not be able to effectively cut off the channels of transmission and the outbreak may be repeated at any time.</seg>
<seg id="269">Whilst molecular modelling and biochemical analysis have demonstrated the association of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the gaseous cell and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also combine with cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the epidemic last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How does the virus genetically evolve in the course of human transmission?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it become a global pandemic? Is it disappearing like SARS?</seg>
<seg id="275">Finding answers to the above and many other questions is essential, but may take longer.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to put an end to the epidemic and restore normalcy to our lives as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2">Many attempts to develop the vaccine are still under way, although no clinical trials have yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="3">In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that no SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for this pathogenic virus was expected to occur within 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In April, five candidate vaccines entered phase I security studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, COVID-19 was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread globally, triggering considerable investment and research in the development of vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many organizations are developing possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using the published viral genome.</seg>
<seg id="8">CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and stated that it was imperative to have speed, productive capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.</seg>
<seg id="9">In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main platform targets for entry into Phase I safety studies include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (I stage developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)</seg>
<seg id="12">Viral vector (Stage I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, 5 gland viral vector)</seg>
<seg id="13">CEPI Scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were identified as ongoing projects (79 according to Mirken Institute data) and 37 were announced, with little public information (predicted in planning or design).</seg>
<seg id="14">Initial safety and immune prototype tests are carried out in I-II trials, usually multi-point tests for random, comfort control, and more precise and effective doses are determined.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the best dose.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (recognized as of early April 2020), 74 have not been evaluated (and are still in "pre-clinical" studies).</seg>
<seg id="17">On or about 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pincer vaccine that could be genetically modified for viral proteins to stimulate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the beginning of vaccine development with the goal of 2021 to begin human testing.</seg>

<seg id="32">On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that 11 separate strains were being studied and that even if progress was accelerated, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="33">On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that viral particles of the coronary virus had been developed with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.</seg>
<seg id="34">Candidate vaccines are under laboratory research and are scheduled to undergo human testing in July or August 2020.</seg>
<seg id="35">Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a "large sum of money" to obtain exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government protested.</seg>
<seg id="36">On March 17, 2020, Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical company, announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="37">The mRNA-based candidate vaccine BNT162 is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing and is expected to commence clinical trials in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="38">On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and that their final candidate vaccine could begin human testing in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="39">On 19 March 2020, in France, the Epidemiological Innovation Alliance (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million for the establishment of the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Alliance, comprising the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of vaccines to $29 million.</seg>
<seg id="40">CEPI's other investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="41">On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="42">Researchers at the Imperial Institute of Technology in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-increasing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="43">The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence of viruses published in China.</seg>
<seg id="44">In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical response to COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.</seg>
<seg id="45">At about the same time, the Canadian government announced that $192 million would be dedicated to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and planned to establish a national "vaccine bank", including several new vaccines, so that they could be put into use in the event of another coronary virus outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pitt CoVacc School of Medicine reported a test for PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine for mice, and stated that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by the MNA could produce a strong antigen-specific antibody response, which began to appear two weeks after immunization".</seg>
<seg id="47">On April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo, Canada, announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine for possible nose spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Researchers have used bacterial phages to design DNA for internal reproduction in human bacteria to produce sound viral samples, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 viruses.</seg>
<seg id="49">In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM supercomputers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means that, in addition to preventing diseases, they can bring other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="52">Further random trials in Australia are in the process of recruiting 4,170 health personnel.</seg>
<seg id="53">Vaccines under development may be unsafe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, have shown the need for biosafety Level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and for international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there were no SARS treatments or preventive vaccines that were safe and effective for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a priority for Governments and public health agencies worldwide, and there is currently no effective vaccine for MERS.</seg>
<seg id="58">At the time of the MERS epidemic, it was thought that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infections.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of March 2020, one ( DNA-based) MERS vaccine had been clinically tested for phase I human body, and three other vaccines were under development, all viral vector vaccines, two gland viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).</seg>
<seg id="60">Various social media articles have contributed to conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and vaccines are available.</seg>
<seg id="61">Patents cited in various social media articles refer to genetic sequences of other existing coronary viruses (such as SARS coronary viruses) and vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) of the lung, arteries, heart, kidney and intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2">ACE2 is expected to serve as a drug target for cardiovascular disease ACE2 and some coronary viral entrances to cells by reducing the levels of vascular stressin II and increasing the levels of Ang (1-7) inhibiting the activity of the related vascular stressin conversion enzyme (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE).</seg>
<seg id="3">The human source version of this enzyme is commonly called hACE2.</seg>
<seg id="4">The vascular tension conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme located on the surfaces of inner leather cells and other cells.</seg>
<seg id="5">ACE2 proteins contain a N-terminal peptide enzyme M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin trans-shipment protein domain for kidney amino acids.</seg>
<seg id="6">ACE2 is a monotonic I-type membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is exposed to the cell surfaces of the lungs and other tissues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme, called sheddase, fractures the extracellular domain of ACE2 from the transmembrane domain, releases soluble proteins to the blood and eventually leaks to the urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly the type II lung bubble cells of the lungs, the intestinal cortees of the small intestine, the arterial and intravenous cortex cells of most organs, and the arterial smooth muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in cerebral cortex, texture, lower brain and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main function of ACE2 is to checks and balances ACE.</seg>
<seg id="11">ACE cracked the vascular nuclide I into the vascular nuclide II with vascular contractions.</seg>
<seg id="12">ACE2 then broke the carboxyl carboxylic terminal phenyl aminoate (Phenyl phenyl phenyl aminoate) of ACE2 (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into vascular tension (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).</seg>
<seg id="13">ACE2 can also break down many other peptides, including dehydration amino acids 9, apelin, neurorelief, morphine peptide A and stomach Hunger.</seg>
<seg id="14">ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid trans-shipment protein SLC6A19, and is associated with Hartnup's disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronary viruses into the cell, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that led to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that led to COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="16">More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's S1 glycerin binds to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, leading to ingestion and co-location of viruses and enzymes into the nucleus in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">This entry process also requires the activation of S protein by the host filinase TMPRSS2 and the inhibition of this process is being studied as a potential therapeutic method for some people to speculate that lowering the ACE2 level in the cell may help to combat infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, several professional associations and regulators recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, "the use of ACE inhibitor treatment reduces the risk of pneumonia for patients who are at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure."</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in mortality associated with pneumonia, but the results are less reliable than the overall risk of pneumonia."</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which seems to improve the indicators of blood flow mechanics and oxygen saturation for acute respiratory distress caused by lipid polygose.</seg>
<seg id="23">The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, with 30 minutes of effect and 24 hours of action (continuing time).</seg>
<seg id="24">Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with a classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) resistance or for patients with a higher level of circular vascular tension II, and that the effects of the rhACE2 infusion for acute respiratory distress syndrome have been evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Coronavirus epidemic 2019-2020 is a persistent epidemic of the 2019 new coronary virus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">This outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and 30 January 2020 as a public health emergency and 11 March 2020 as an epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases and 9.77 million deaths were reported cumulatively in 210 countries and territories worldwide,</seg>
<seg id="4">About 364,000 people were cured.</seg>
<seg id="5">In China, the rate is about 4 per cent, while in all regions of the world the rate ranges from 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) to 13.04 per cent (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include heat, cough and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="7">There may also be complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.</seg>
<seg id="8">The latency period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no vaccine or special antiviral treatment programme available.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinical treatment focuses on treatment for symptoms and recommends preventive measures such as hand washing, coughing the mouth, maintaining a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-segregation of people suspected of infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official authorities in various countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The global socio-economic impact of the epidemic has been severe and sports, religious, political and cultural activities have been postponed or cancelled, while panic shopping has exacerbated widespread supply shortages.</seg>
<seg id="13">Globally, 193 countries and territories have implemented national or local stoppages, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of primary, secondary and tertiary students.</seg>
<seg id="14">The spread of false viral information online has led to incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other ethnic and profiling groups of East and South-East Asian origins and groups in regions where the epidemic is severe.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and the closure of the heavy industry led to lower air pollution indices and lower carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 31 December 2019, the Health Department of Wuhan (Hubei Province) of China notified an unknown number of cases of pneumonia and initiated an investigation in early January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea, so the new coronavirus is considered to be common to humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that triggered the outbreak, called SARS-CoV-2, was a newly discovered virus, closely related to Bat-Crown Virus, Crown Piercing Yamount Virus, and SARS-CoV, which was confirmed to have an outbreak on December 1, 2019, without any apparent connection to the subsequent South China Seafood market cases.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On March 13, 2020, the Nanhua Morning News published an unconfirmed report stating that the first case could be traced back to November 17, 2019, when 55-year-old men were from Hubei province, and that on February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in the number of newly reported cases in China, but a sudden and dramatic increase in the number of newly reported cases in Italy, Iran and the Republic of Korea, and that the number of new cases outside China exceeded for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.</seg>
<seg id="22">As at 26 February, the number of reported cases among adolescents was relatively low, with the proportion of cases among adolescents aged 19 years and under worldwide being only 2.4 per cent, according to Patrick Valance, Chief Scientific Adviser, who estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the population in the United Kingdom would need to be infected with the new coronary virus in order to obtain effective group immunization.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases is the number of people tested for COVID-19 and confirmed as positive under the official program.</seg>
<seg id="24">As at 23 March, the proportion of people tested worldwide was less than 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries have also issued official policies for non-detection of people with minor illnesses, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">A study published on 16 March noted that, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of China's COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that 79 per cent of the recorded cases had been the source of infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to a statistical analysis published on 30 March, the actual number of infections in Italy is far higher than the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">The COVID-19 basic number of infections (R0) was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States suggests that R0 may be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most COVID-19 patients can be rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="30">The period from illness to death is 6-41 days for those who cannot recover, and 14 days is the most common.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of 10 April 2020, about 9.7 million people had died in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths in China were among persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual COVID-19 death toll may well exceed statistics, as this data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who died at home, in sanatoriums, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times the number of deaths from the new coronary virus pneumonia officially recorded.</seg>
<seg id="35">A CDC spokeswoman said, "We know that [the number of deaths published] is lower than the actual figure", and anecdotal reports that U.S. data are underestimated frequently in the epidemiological field, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic, which led to the first confirmed death in China on January 9, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="36">On 1 February, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on 14 February, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of 28 February, more than 10 deaths had occurred outside of China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="38">As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were often used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These figures vary from region to region and vary over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the quality of the health system, the treatment programme, the time of the first outbreak of the disease and the age, gender and general health status, with the death rate divided by the number of people diagnosed during the given period.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).</seg>
<seg id="41">Disease and death rates vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimated death rate fell from 17.3 per cent (for persons with 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with 1 February 2020), as well as from case mortality (CFR) to infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the number of deaths due to illness as a percentage of the number of confirmed cases, which reflects the percentage of deaths due to illness (including the number of confirmed and unconfirmed cases).</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics are not time-limited and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific population groups.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars have attempted to calculate these data for specific groups of people.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Centre for Evidence-based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimated that the overall incidence of the epidemic ranged from 0.1% to 0.39%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The upper limit for this range is consistent with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis of the impact on CFR estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization claimed that the epidemic was manageable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and varies from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania stated, "If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious disease usually stagnate after the depletion of existing hosts and then begin to alleviate them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is almost impossible for us now to reasonably predict when the point of abduction will occur."</seg>
<seg id="51">The Chinese government's Senior Medical Adviser Chung Nan-san said that "the end of the epidemic in June can be expected if all countries mobilize to adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) on measures to prevent the spread of the virus".</seg>
<seg id="52">On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "may erupt repeatedly for one to two years".</seg>
<seg id="53">Research led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology has shown that physical distance and other measures are necessary "before the vaccine is put into use (which may require 18 months or more)."</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from the University of Vanderborg said, "This coronary virus is highly propagated, and I do not think it is likely to disappear altogether", and "may evolve into a seasonal disease, which erupts once a year".</seg>
<seg id="55">The ability to re-emerge depends on the immune strength of the population and the degree of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected persons may be asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are heat (88%) and whooping cough (68%).</seg>
<seg id="58">The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell, aerostility, muscle and clock pain, throat, headache, cooling, vomiting, blood grobing, diarrhoea or cyanosis, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), about one sixth of patients may become seriously ill and have breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="59">The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) listed breathing difficulties, continuing chest pain or stress, suddenly obscure consciousness, difficulty in awakening and face or lip haemorrhage as emergency symptoms; in the event of such symptoms, further development of the disease could result in severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septicaemia, infectious shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some of the infected may have no symptoms and no clinical signs, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of the close contact with the confirmed patient to exclude the possibility of infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China estimates that the proportion of people with no symptomatic infections is very low to 44 per cent inferior.</seg>
<seg id="62">The period of latency (the time span between infection and morbidity) is generally 1-14 days; five days are most common for uncertainty, which can be illustrated by the fact that the percentage of patients with no smell in COVID-19 was originally estimated at 30% and later decreased to 15%.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details on the pathway of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly through close exposure and from fly foam when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close exposure means 1-2 m (3-6 ft).</seg>
<seg id="65">It was found that the absence of cough could result in the fly-out of 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (15-27 ft) of the foam.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has also been suggested that airborne foams produced by people who speak may also cause the virus to spread, although the virus is usually not airborne, but people may also have foams when breathing or speaking.</seg>
<seg id="67">The foam may fall into the nose of the surrounding people and may even be inhaled in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as plugging and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may result in aerosolization of the respiratory endocrine.</seg>
<seg id="69">Also, if a person touchs the surface (including skin) contaminated by the virus before touching his or her eyes and nose, the virus may spread.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is also concern that the virus may be spread through excreta, but this risk is considered to be low.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese Government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 excreta transmission, which is the most contagious virus three days before the outbreak, but also before and after the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="72">Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days prior to the occurrence, indicating that the new coronavirus was already contagious prior to the apparent symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although few cases of asymptomatic disease have been diagnosed in laboratories, symptomatic infections have been detected in some countries in the course of contact-tracking investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) stated that although the transmission of the new coronary virus was not yet fully known, the virus would generally be transmitted to two to three people, ranging from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, new coronaviruses are known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on paperboard for one day and copper for up to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, the lifetime of pets and other animals COVID-19 have been tested positive due to humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="77">There is no evidence that animals will re-infect the virus to humans, but official British agencies have advised people to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they may have been touching surfaces by other infected people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first separated from a group of three patients with acute respiratory system diseases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus before it enters the human body, which can be extinguished by domestic soap, since soap can dissolve the virus's protective membrane, SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is currently considered to be a common human and livestock disease.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis has shown that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the Sarbecovirus sub-groups of Sarbecovirus and two bats from virus strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">The New Crown virus and other Bat Crown Virus samples (BatCov RaTG13) are consistent with 96% of the total genome level.</seg>
<seg id="83">In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that viruses and human viruses in the hill-piercing body fell short of one amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence.</seg>
<seg id="84">To date, full genome comparisons have found that up to 92% of the genetic material is the same between the crown-piercing virus and SARS-CoV-2 and is not sufficient to prove that the piercing is the middle host.</seg>
<seg id="85">The virus can be initially diagnosed with symptoms, but eventually it can only be diagnosed by reverted transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.</seg>
<seg id="86">A PCR and CT comparison study in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and that many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of March 2020, the American Radiology Society recommended that "CT should not be used to screen COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease".</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health Organization (WHO) has now published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.</seg>
<seg id="89">Nucleic acid detection uses real-time reversal of the recorded polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory samples or blood samples may be used for detection.</seg>
<seg id="91">The results are generally available in hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Typically, such tests are carried out by swabs in the nose or swabs, and many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of 6 April 2020, none of these tests had been confirmed to be sufficiently accurate to permit widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use only by the Confidence Laboratory in emergency cases.</seg>
<seg id="95">Typical imaging features of patients with X tablets and computer fault scanning (CT) include asymmetry of glass glass and chestless fluids.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiology Institute is compiling an international online database of images of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to the overlap with other viral infections (e.g. adenvirus), images not recognized by PCR have limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="98">A large Chinese study comparing the results of CT in the chest with those of the PCR found that, although the image was less specific to the identification of the infection, the detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a means of screening in pop areas.</seg>
<seg id="99">A volume-based neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed that can be used jointly with X films and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good hygiene practices, hand washing, avoidance of unwashed hands touching the nose directly, coughing or sneezing with a paper scarf covering the nose and the used paper scarf being dumped directly into a garbage drum.</seg>
<seg id="101">A person suspected to be infected should wear a medical surgical mask when entering a public place.</seg>
<seg id="102">Measures to maintain physical distances were also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus, and many Governments had restricted or recommended that they should refrain from travelling to and from countries and areas affected by the epidemic where it was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means that the virus is spreading within the community and that medical personnel in some communities who come into contact with people suspected of being infected should take standard precautions, measures of access and eye protection, which are important tools for health supervision to identify the source of transmission and prevent further transmission.</seg>
<seg id="105">The Government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracing purposes raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, issued statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="106">Various mobile applications are now in use or in-proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Once the user is in close contact with the COVID-19 test-positive patient, the user receives a reminder that erroneous statements to prevent infection continue to spread; such as washing the nose and rinse mouths are ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended that the spread of the disease be stopped through hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="110">The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advised that people were often wash hand with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there was visible sludge, such as toilets or on their hands, before cooking, and after sneezing, cough or sneeze.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because, before entering the human body, the virus only needs to use domestic soap to destroy its protective capsule, which can kill the virus.</seg>
<seg id="112">The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommended that hand washing with at least 60% alcohol content if there is no soap and running water on the body.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">The surface of an object can be disinfected using a variety of solvents (disinfection fluids can be effective within a minute of stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium perchlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvinone iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other solutions (e.g. benzachloronium chloride and chlorohexagonate) are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">CDC recommended that if new CV pneumonia suspected or diagnosed cases were to occur in offices or day-care facilities, all regions should be disinfected, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATMs used by patients.</seg>
<seg id="117">WHO recommended that people covered their nose with bending elbows or scarves when coughing or sneezing, and immediately disposed of all contaminated paper scarves.</seg>
<seg id="118">Suspected infected persons are advised to wear surgical masks, which can reduce the amount of fly foam called when speaking, sneezing and coughing, and the distance from transmission.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health Organization has issued a note on the use of masks and methods of their use.</seg>
<seg id="120">Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said that "the wearing of masks reduces people's tendency to mask their faces, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of a hand-sanitary capacity, and also recommends that people who care for people suspected of being infected wear masks."</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that healthy people only need to wear masks in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help to avoid touching their faces.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended wearing non-medical masks made of cloth, and China explicitly recommended that healthy citizens should also wear a one-time medical mask, especially in close contact with others (within 1 m (3 ft).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China, recommends wearing masks in public transport or in crowd-intensive places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advised people to make their own masks and to clean them every day.</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech Republic and Slovakia strictly prohibit access to public places without hood or nose.</seg>
<seg id="127">On 16 March, Viet Nam required all persons to wear masks in order to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian Government requires that all persons enter grocery shops with masks.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, and on 1 April it was required to wear masks in train and intercity buses.</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama requires masks to be wearing outside the country and recommends that masks be made of their own by residents who cannot afford them.</seg>
<seg id="132">The masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection control measures for maintaining social distances (also known as maintaining physical distances) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thus reduce the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension from school, work and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="135">Measures that individuals may take to maintain social distances include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, changing to non-contact waiting methods and maintaining physical distances with others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Many Governments have now made it mandatory to request or recommend that areas affected by the epidemic remain socially distant.</seg>
<seg id="137">With regard to the size of the largest crowds, the original recommendation of the United States Government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which was quickly reduced to 50 and then to 10.</seg>
<seg id="138">On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people and groups with basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and damage to the immune system. The German Centers for Disease Control (DRC) recommended that such groups of people living in epidemiological areas should not travel as far as possible, and in late March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, including virtual and long-distance links.</seg>
<seg id="139">The use of the term "social distance" implies that people are required to be completely isolated from society, and some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic, without encouraging people to use other means to maintain personal connections.</seg>
<seg id="140">The recommendations include having sexual relations only with a partner living with no virus or asymptomatic status.</seg>
<seg id="141">COVID-19 is recommended for self-segregation in the home of persons diagnosed and suspected to be infected.</seg>
<seg id="142">Health institutions have issued detailed descriptions of the correct self-segregation, which many Governments have imposed or recommended for the entire population of the epidemic area.</seg>
<seg id="143">The harshest self-segregation instructions have also been issued to high-risk populations.</seg>
<seg id="144">If there is a possibility of exposure to COVID-19 patients, or to countries or areas where there has been widespread transmission in the near future, self-segregation is recommended for 14 days from the time the virus is last likely to be exposed.</seg>
<seg id="145">Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/depression and mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="146">The containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating the infected, together with other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.</seg>
<seg id="147">If it is not possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts will be made to transition to a phase of mitigation: measures to reduce the spread of the disease and its impact on the health system and society.</seg>
<seg id="148">Containment and mitigation measures may take place simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="149">Inhibition requires more extreme preventive and control measures, and part of the effort to control the outbreak by reducing the basic regeneration to below 1 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is the epidemiological curve known to us.</seg>
<seg id="150">This would reduce the risk of collapse of the health service system and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.</seg>
<seg id="151">Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as maintaining craft hygiene, wearing masks and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distances, such as stopping schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning, which China immediately adopted stricter containment measures, such as closures and strict travel bans.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="153">Korea introduced large-scale screening and partial isolation measures and issued alerts on the trajectory of the infected.</seg>
<seg id="154">Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes heavy fines on those infected who refuse to self-segregate.</seg>
<seg id="155">Taiwan, China, has increased the production of masks, and simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States of America that impose penalties on suppliers of covered medical goods show that there are significant challenges to easing (mitigating, but not halting, the spread of the epidemic) and inhibiting (reversing the spread of the epidemic).</seg>
<seg id="156">Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak medical needs by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of the health system.</seg>
<seg id="157">The repression may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained that the virus will not be transmitted among the population (or until the vaccine is rolled out, whichever is the first-in-first-in-the-first-in-first-in-first-in-first-in-time) or that the transmission will quickly rebound if the measure is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Long-term interventions aimed at curbing the pandemic have social and economic costs.</seg>
<seg id="159">No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development, including testing of existing drugs, is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="160">The use of non-prescription induction drugs, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="161">Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory support may be required.</seg>
<seg id="162">The use of steroids may lead to a deterioration of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="163">Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="164">The World Health Organization (WHO) also noted that some "traditional and home therapy" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.</seg>
<seg id="165">The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that improving treatment capacity and adapting health systems to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is the basic response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="166">ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services in COVID-19 testing, the elimination of selective procedures where possible, the separation and segregation of COVID-19 positive patients, and the improvement of intensive care by training personnel and increasing the number of respiratory respirators and beds available.</seg>
<seg id="167">There are divergent speculations about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).</seg>
<seg id="168">The first known case of new coronary viral pneumonia can be traced to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.</seg>
<seg id="169">Within one month, the number of new coronary viruses in Hubei province has gradually increased.</seg>
<seg id="170">Most of these patients are associated with the wholesale market in the South China Sea, which also sells living animals, a theory that the new coronary virus originates from some of these animals; or, in other words, on 26 December, the doctors of the Central West Medical Union Hospital in Hubei province first discovered and treated an unknown number of pneumonia patients and reported it to the Wuhan Jiang Han District Disease Prevention and Control Centre on 27 December.</seg>
<seg id="171">On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "sample virus similar to SARS".</seg>
<seg id="172">Eight doctors, including Li Wen Liang, were cautioned by the police for spreading "rumours", while another, Ephin, was cautioned by his superiors for sailing alerts.</seg>
<seg id="173">The Wuhan City Board of Health and Health subsequently issued a proclamation on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="174">After receiving numerous reports of cases of unknown causes of pneumonia, the Wuhan Health Department launched a survey in early January, which doubled the number of cases every seven and a half days in the early days of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="175">From early January to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, influenced by the large population movements at Spring Festival in China and the use of Wuhan as a transport hub and main railway hub.</seg>
<seg id="176">On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases within one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.</seg>
<seg id="177">Subsequent official data show that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had been diagnosed with symptoms in the United States as of 26 March, surpassing China and Italy, making it the country with the highest number of confirmed cases globally reported as of 9 April 2020 with more than 1.61 million confirmed cases; more than 9.77 million deaths and more than 36.4 million treated.</seg>
<seg id="178">Some 200 countries and territories worldwide reported confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="179">As a result of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted preventive and control measures that restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.</seg>
<seg id="180">National-level responses included containment, such as isolation (also known as residence orders, local asylum orders or closures) and curfews, as of 2 April, with nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90 per cent of the total population, in some form of blockade, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.</seg>
<seg id="181">On 26 March, 1.7 billion people were in some form of blockade worldwide, rising two days later to 2.6 billion, about one third of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="182">The first COVID-19 confirmed case dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculated that the first case dates back to 17 November.</seg>
<seg id="183">On 26 December, an unknown number of cases of pneumonia were detected by Dr. Zhang Jiushin, who was reported to the Jianghan District Disease Prevention and Control Centre in the city of Wuhan by his hospital on 27 December.</seg>
<seg id="184">On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronary viruses was found in a preliminary genetic test of a patient sample.</seg>
<seg id="185">The Wuhan City Board of Health and Health issued a proclamation on 31 December,</seg>
<seg id="186">It was reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.</seg>
<seg id="187">Following these notifications, several doctors in the city of Wuhan were warned by the police for "rumours" spreading the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="188">The National Health and Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="189">In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical movement, which he later described as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="190">On 23 January, the government announced a line to prevent people from entering and leaving Wuhan in Wuhanla, which was later extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people, "the largest isolation in human history".</seg>
<seg id="191">The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.</seg>
<seg id="192">The celebration of the New Year of Chinese Farmers' calendar (25 January) was also cancelled in many places.</seg>
<seg id="193">The Government has also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Marsan Hospital, which will be ready for delivery within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="194">Another hospital, the Ray Shengshan Hospital, was subsequently built to deal with more patients.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the new hospital, China also converted 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, into a bunker hospital on 26 January, and the Government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health declarations to travellers and the extension of spring holidays.</seg>
<seg id="196">The country's universities and primary and secondary schools have also been completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Hong Kong and Macao regions of China have also taken a number of measures, particularly for primary, secondary and tertiary schools.</seg>
<seg id="198">Remote home office measures have been introduced in many parts of China.</seg>
<seg id="199">Travel restrictions have also been imposed in addition to Hubei Province in other capacities.</seg>
<seg id="200">Public transport was restructured, and museums across China were temporarily closed.</seg>
<seg id="201">In many cities, public activity facilities have been regulated, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to some form of outdoor activity restrictions, with the Chinese authorities taking strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries and regions after the March epidemic entered the global phase.</seg>
<seg id="202">For example, the 14-day period of forced isolation in Beijing for all people entering Beijing outside China was observed in China during the five days prior to 23 March, when only one indigenous case was reported in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="203">On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases in China had been largely curtailed and that the Chinese epidemic had been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the same day, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that it would suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits from the Hubei region, with the exception of Wuhan, two full months after the blockade had been imposed, with no details being disclosed as to when the policy would end.</seg>
<seg id="205">Persons wishing to enter China are required to apply for a visa from the Chinese embassy or consulate.</seg>
<seg id="206">The Chinese Government encouraged businesses and factories to resume their work on 30 March and provided them with monetary stimulus plans to mark 4 April as a national day of mourning, which coincided with a three-minute national day of mourning at 10:00 p.m., and the Central Government encouraged families to join the network to pay tribute to their deceased relatives in order to maintain physical distances and avoid a second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="207">On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was diagnosed in Korea.</seg>
<seg id="208">The Korean Health Agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to a new religious movement rally in Daegu, Korea, the Church of Jesus in New Heaven.</seg>
<seg id="209">The New Heavens from Wuhan to Daegu were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="210">As of 22 February, 1,261 of the 9,336 members of the church, or about 13% of them reported symptoms, were declared to the highest level of vigilance on 23 February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="211">On 28 February, Korea cumulatively reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.</seg>
<seg id="212">The virus test results of three soldiers confirmed positive status, and all South Korean military bases have since been isolated.</seg>
<seg id="213">The flight schedule was also adapted to the effects of the epidemic, and South Korea launched a programme of virus screening for large populations, segregating all infected persons, and tracking and segregating people in close contact with those infected.</seg>
<seg id="214">Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new entrants from abroad via mobile applications, free testing of the virus, with results to be obtained the following day, and improved detection capacity to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.</seg>
<seg id="215">Although the entire city was not segregated, South Korean plans were considered to have been successful in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and South Korean society initially polarized its response to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="216">Many Koreans signed petitions, some calling for impeachment, blaming the government for improper handling of the epidemic and others for his response strategy.</seg>
<seg id="217">On 23 March, the lowest single-day number of new cases reported in Korea since four weeks' appearance was reported.</seg>
<seg id="218">On 29 March, it was reported that all newly arrived overseas personnel would be separated for two weeks from 1 April.</seg>
<seg id="219">According to media reports on 1 April, the Republic of Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries and territories.</seg>
<seg id="220">On 19 February, Iran announced that the first SARS-CoV-2 cases had been confirmed in Kum and that two patients had died that day according to the Iranian Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="221">Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the complete suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="222">Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to combat the virus.</seg>
<seg id="223">On 26 February 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, stated that there were no plans to block areas affected by the epidemic, but only to isolate infected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="224">In March, Iran announced plans to limit inter-city travel, but inter-city traffic congestion continued into the Persian New Year.</seg>
<seg id="225">The Shia holy sites in the Kum area remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre for transmission of the virus after China.</seg>
<seg id="226">The extent of the outbreak in Iran has been concealed by a number of sources, including the fact that, as at 28 February, more than a dozen cases had been traced to Iran, thus indicating that the actual outbreak in Iran was more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Government as at that date.</seg>
<seg id="227">The Iranian Parliament was forced to close, and 23 of its 290 members were reportedly found positive on 3 March.</seg>
<seg id="228">On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent and to release all eligible prisoners on a temporary basis.</seg>
<seg id="229">It noted that the transmission of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, was more at risk and that these institutions lacked adequate health care measures.</seg>
<seg id="230">On 15 March, the Government of Iran reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number reported in the country since the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="231">As at 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="232">As at 23 March, Iran had 50 new confirmed cases per hour and 1 new case of coronary virus death per 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="233">According to WHO officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.</seg>
<seg id="234">The view was also expressed that the United States sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to respond to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="235">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the relaxation of economic sanctions in the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.</seg>
<seg id="236">On 31 January, two Chinese tourists were tested positive in Rome as a result of SARS-CoV-2, and the epidemic was confirmed to have spread to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="237">Subsequently, the number of cases in the country rose sharply, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="238">From the 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was discovered, and on 22 February the Cabinet of Ministers announced new decrees to contain the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.</seg>
<seg id="239">The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, declared that "no access to the epidemic area is permitted".</seg>
<seg id="240">The area had ordered the suspension of work and sporting events." On 4 March, 100 deaths in the country occurred, and the Italian government ordered a total suspension of classes at all levels of the country.</seg>
<seg id="241">All major sporting events, including the Italian Primera División, will be held in an audience-free mode by April, but on 9 March all sporting events were fully suspended for at least one month.</seg>
<seg id="242">On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the discontinuation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies, and on 6 March the Italian Society of Anaesthetic Psychiatric Medicine (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on possible referral programmes.</seg>
<seg id="243">On 19 March, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, surpassing China, making it the world's largest number of new coronary virus deaths.</seg>
<seg id="244">On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="245">As of 5 April, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy stood at 128,948 deaths, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cured cases, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.</seg>
<seg id="246">Cable News Network of the United States has reported that the double factor in Italy's large elderly population and the inability to detect all virus infections so far may be part of the cause of high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="247">The initial British reaction to the virus was considered to be one of the most relaxed in the affected countries until 18 March 2020, when the British government introduced various forms of social distance or mass isolation measures for its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="248">The British government was criticised for its lack of speed and effort in responding to public concerns, and on 16 March, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the removal of any unwanted travel and social contacts, suggesting that people stay home as far as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants and theatres.</seg>
<seg id="249">On 20 March, the Government announced that all leisure facilities, including bars and gymnasiums, should be closed as soon as possible and committed to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' wages and a maximum of Pound2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the event of a crisis, and on 23 March the British Prime Minister announced stricter measures for maintaining social distances, prohibiting gatherings of more than two persons, and prohibiting any travel and outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="250">Unlike previous measures, the declared restrictions were enforced by the police through fines and dispersion of assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="251">With the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, five gold shops, petrol stations and garages, most of the other operations were suspended.</seg>
<seg id="252">The first COVID-19 confirmed case in the United States was found in Washington, Northwest Pacific on January 20, and the patients returned from Wuhan on January 15.</seg>
<seg id="253">On 29 January, the White House established a task force on coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="254">On 31 January, the Trump government declared a state of public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travellers from China.</seg>
<seg id="255">On January 28, 2020, the United States Centers for Disease Control (the leading public health agency in the United States Government) announced that they had developed their own test kits.</seg>
<seg id="256">Nevertheless, the United States has been slow to begin testing, masking the true state of the epidemic at the time.</seg>
<seg id="257">The federal government's February production of reagent boxes was flawed and it was not until the end of February that the federal government approved the use of non-governmental reagent boxes (from academia, companies and hospitals) and until early March that the test qualification criteria (after which medical will be required) were determined, all of which resulted in the United States pre-testing being blocked.</seg>
<seg id="258">On 27 February, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 4,000.</seg>
<seg id="259">On 13 March, The Atlantic reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 14,000.</seg>
<seg id="260">On March 22, the Associated Press reported that "many patients with symptoms and medical advice waited several hours or days before being tested" and that on February 29, Washington reported the first death in the United States, Governor Jay Innsley declared a state of emergency and other states soon followed suit.</seg>
<seg id="261">On March 3, the Seattle regional school closed, and on March 6, 2020, a number of epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave predictions of the effects of new coronary viruses in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Prevention and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="263">Enterprises impose travel restrictions on employees, cancel meetings and encourage employees to work at home.</seg>
<seg id="264">On 11 March, Trump announced that a 30-day travel ban would be imposed on most European countries except the United Kingdom from 13 March.</seg>
<seg id="265">The following day, Trump extended the restrictions to Britain and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="266">On 13 March, Trump declared a state of emergency and began to use federal funds to respond to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="267">Since 15 March, many businesses across the United States have closed or shortened their business hours with a view to mitigating the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">As of March 17, 50 states across the United States and the District of Columbia had reported confirmed cases on March 23, and New York City reported 10,700 confirmed cases of new coronary viruses, surpassing the total number of Korean cases.</seg>
<seg id="269">On March 25, the Governor of New York said that maintaining social distance seemed to have begun to work, and the doubling of the interval of cases was estimated from 2.0 to 4.7 days.</seg>
<seg id="270">As at 28 March, the total number of confirmed cases in New York City was 32,308, with 672 deaths due to the virus, and on 26 March it was reported that the number of new coronary virus infections diagnosed in the United States exceeded that of any other country, including China and Italy, with 400,335 cumulative confirmed cases and 12,841 deaths in the United States as at 8 April.</seg>
<seg id="271">According to media reports on 30 March, U.S. President Trump decided to extend the social distance code until 30 April.</seg>
<seg id="272">On the same day, the medical ship comfort, which had approximately 1,000 beds, was anchored in New York.</seg>
<seg id="273">On April 3, the U.S. recorded 884 new coronary virus deaths within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="274">On April 3, the White House instructed health officers and scientists to coordinate with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence public statements and publications related to the virus in order to dilute the threat and control the transmission of information, a move that was blamed by the public.</seg>
<seg id="275">The general popular acceptance of the Trump crisis prevention and control measures has been polarized by partisan differences.</seg>
<seg id="276">Some United States officials and commentators criticized the United States for relying on the importation of essential medical supplies from China.</seg>
<seg id="277">The air travel mode analysis was used to map and forecast the mode of transmission, and was published in the journal Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="278">According to information published by the International Air Transport Association in 2018, travel from Wuhan to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei was the largest.</seg>
<seg id="279">Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported to be popular tourist destinations from Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="280">Among the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali was reported to be the worst-prepared, and Australia's cities were best-prepared to release a new coronary virus (COVID-19) emergency plan on 7 February.</seg>
<seg id="281">It was reported that knowledge of COVID-19 was not sufficiently advanced and that Australia would focus on border control and communication in response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="282">On 21 March, Australia declared a "state of emergency for human biosafety".</seg>
<seg id="283">Since public transport in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei is effectively segregated, some countries and regions have plans to withdraw their nationals and diplomatic personnel residing in these areas, mainly through national charter flights and with the permission of the relevant Chinese authorities.</seg>
<seg id="284">Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan their withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="285">Pakistan stated that it would not withdraw its nationals from China.</seg>
<seg id="286">On 7 February, Brazil withdrew 34 Brazilians or family members and 4 Poles, 1 Chinese and 1 Indian.</seg>
<seg id="287">Brazilian aircraft passed through Poland before flying to Brazil, where they stayed for a short stay, with Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="288">Brazilian citizens arriving in Wuhan were sent to a military base near Brasilia for isolation.</seg>
<seg id="289">On the same day, 215 Canadians (of whom 176 were withdrawn from the first plane and 39 from the second plane chartered by the United States Government) withdrew from Wuhan and were sent to Trenton Gardens for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="290">On 11 February, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians took off from Wuhan and landed at the Trenton Gardens base.</seg>
<seg id="291">On 3 and 4 February, the Australian authorities withdrew 277 citizens and sent them to the Christmas Island Detention Centre, which had been converted to a separate location, for a period of 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="295">In early March, the Indian government began evacuating from Iran, and on 14 March, the South African government contracted a South African Airlines aircraft to withdraw 112 South African citizens.</seg>
<seg id="296">Passengers were medically screened prior to the aircraft's take-off, and four South Africans who showed signs of a new coronary virus were left behind to reduce the risk of transmission.</seg>
<seg id="297">Only South Africans whose test results were negative were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="298">All South Africans (including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police officers and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions) were negative and sent to The Ranch Resort for 14 days as a precautionary measure.</seg>
<seg id="299">On 20 March, as a result of the epidemic, the United States began to withdraw some of its troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="300">On 5 February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China indicated that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had provided assistance to China.</seg>
<seg id="301">A group of Chinese students in the U.S. also joined forces to help deliver relief supplies to areas affected by the virus in China, and a joint team from the Greater Chicago region reportedly transported 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on 30 January, in coordination with the Federal Express Relief, and 200,000 masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and protective clothing, to the Wuhan Association and the hospital by 30 January.</seg>
<seg id="302">On 5 February, the Gates and Gates announced a donation of $100 million to the World Health Organization to finance vaccine development and treatment, while protecting "high-risk populations in Africa and South Asia".</seg>
<seg id="303">Interaksyon reported that the Chinese government donated another 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February after Philippine Senator Richard Gordon had delivered 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="304">On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross Society announced that it would provide $2.26 million worth of aid to China.</seg>

<seg id="306">In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent experts and medical supplies to Italy in response to the outbreak of the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="307">Entrepreneur Ma Yun delivered 1.1 million reagent kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective clothing to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to be distributed by the African Union.</seg>
<seg id="308">Ma Yun later transported 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 respirators to Panama.</seg>
<seg id="309">In addition, Ma Yun donated medical supplies to Canada and the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and reagent boxes made in China.</seg>
<seg id="310">Spain, for example, withdrew 5.8 million CFV test kits with an accuracy of only 30 per cent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.</seg>
<seg id="311">Belgium recalled 100,000 unserviceable masks, believed to be from China, but in fact from Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the other hand, China's assistance was well received in Latin America and parts of Africa, and on 2 April the World Bank launched an emergency support initiative for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="313">The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts in the area of epidemic prevention and control.</seg>
<seg id="314">The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS and the current crisis, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts and obstructing prevention and containment, and in the current crisis, the Central Government "commenced regular updating of the situation before the New Year Farm holidays to avoid panic".</seg>
<seg id="315">On 23 January, in response to the Central Government's decision to impose a feudal city on Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that although it was "certainly not a recommendation from WHO", it "confirmed the determination to contain the epidemic from the most concentrated areas" and called it the "unprecedented in the history of public health" initiative, which was confirmed outside China and the number of cases in other countries increased, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandese, noted that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern was based on "global transmission risks, particularly to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".</seg>
<seg id="317">In response to travel restrictions, Tendese stated that "there is no reason to take measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".</seg>
<seg id="318">On 5 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the international community to contribute US$ 675 million to provide funding for low-income national strategic preparedness, stating that there was an urgent need to provide support to countries "that did not have a system for testing those infected with the virus".</seg>
<seg id="319">Tham Desai further issued a statement stating that "the weakest segment determined how powerful we were" and urged the international community to "invest immediately, or at greater cost later on February 11", when the World Health Organization decided to name the disease COVID-19 at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the same day, Tandese stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed that "the United Nations will respond fully to the epidemic".</seg>
<seg id="321">To this end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the response across the United Nations, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), so that WHO could "focus on the health response and other agencies could use their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development impact of the epidemic".</seg>
<seg id="322">On 14 February, a joint Chinese mission led by the World Health Organization (WHO) was launched, sending international and World Health Organization experts to China on the ground to assist in the response to the local epidemic and assess "the severity and contagion of the disease" through seminars and meetings with key national agencies, and on 25 February, the World Health Organization announced that "provincial and district-level response activities, including the differences between urban and rural areas, should be assessed" and that "greater global efforts should be made to adequately prepare for the potential coronary virus epidemic" and noted that although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be "prepared for".</seg>
<seg id="323">In response to the unfolding epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation, and on 28 February, World Health Organization officials said that the global risk level for the coronary virus epidemic had been increased from "high" to "high", which was the highest level of alert and risk for the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="324">Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the Health Emergency Project of the World Health Organization, warned in a statement: "This is a review of the reality of Governments around the world: a wake-up call.</seg>
<seg id="325">The virus may be approaching, please be prepared", and Governments are urged to take the right response to avoid the "worst situation" around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="326">Ryan further stated that the current data were not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare a global epidemic, and that such a declaration would mean "we largely recognize that all people on Earth may be exposed to the virus".</seg>
<seg id="327">On 11 March, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of a new coronary virus constituted a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="328">The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was "deeply concerned about the pervasive levels and severity of proliferation and the reality of inaction" and that WHO had been critically criticized for its perceived improper handling of the global pandemic, including the delay in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="329">The stronger opposition included a petition for resignation from the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, which had been signed by 73.3 million people as of 6 April.</seg>
<seg id="330">On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Group noted that everyone had the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government should assume that responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="332">The group of experts stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not in any way justify discrimination against specific groups.</seg>
<seg id="333">The expert emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government support.</seg>
<seg id="334">International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information and perspectives and recommendations on policy responses worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="336">From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of embargoes and movement restrictions, the digital centre has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote a global collaborative response to the challenges of the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="337">Since the epidemic began in Hubei Province of China, U.S. and British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, as well as the son of Brazilian President Jail Bosonaro, Eduardo Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese government's approach.</seg>
<seg id="338">Several CPC provincial administrators were dismissed for improper handling of the epidemic in China, reflecting central dissatisfaction with the response of local political institutions.</seg>
<seg id="339">According to some commentators, this was intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="340">Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, denied previously recognized COVID-19 rhetoric that began in Wuhan and supported conspiracy theories that new types of coronary viral pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="341">U.S. President Donald Trump called the new coronary virus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "censorship system has increased the spread of the virus and made it a global pandemic", which in turn has been viewed by some critics as racial discrimination and has "directed attention from the failure of its government to contain the virus".</seg>
<seg id="342">The Daily Beast received a cable from the U.S. government outlining a communication strategy that was apparently issued by the National Security Council, which stated that "all of this is out of touch with China."</seg>
<seg id="343">We were told that this message was disseminated as much as possible in any way, including press conferences and television appearances." The media, such as The Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, claimed that China's assistance to countries affected by the epidemic was intended to promote its global reach.</seg>
<seg id="344">The European Union Foreign Policy Officer Josep Borrell warned that there was a "geopolitical element that included competition for influence through good offices and "g generosity politics".</seg>
<seg id="345">Borrel also stated that "China is making great efforts to promote it as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States".</seg>
<seg id="346">China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, which it had allegedly provided assistance.</seg>
<seg id="347">On 3 April, the 100,000 masks donated by Maayun to Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="348">The United States authorities were also accused of transferring aid to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="349">There are also reports of mask disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as between the Czech Republic and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="350">In addition, Turkey had intercepted hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="351">In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Italian ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, stated, "only China has responded bilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="353">This, of course, is not a good sign of European solidarity."</seg>
<seg id="354">On 22 March, Russian President Putin arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, following a conversation with Italian Prime Minister Kunt.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Italian News quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political official" saying that 80% of Russian aid was "almost useless for Italy".</seg>
<seg id="356">The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.</seg>
<seg id="357">Attilio Fontana, Governor of Lombardy and Luigi Di Maio, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, rejected media reports and expressed their appreciation.</seg>
<seg id="358">Russia also dispatched a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="359">According to Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin Palace, "[Putin] offered assistance to U.S. colleagues, believing that once the U.S. manufacturer of medical equipment and materials regains its capacity, it would pay if necessary".</seg>
<seg id="360">The planned NATO "Defenders 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea was the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war and will be scaled down.</seg>
<seg id="361">Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Movement for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the "Defenders 2020" exercise, which "would endanger not only the lives of the U.S. and many European participants in the national army, but also the inhabitants of the country where the exercise was carried out", and the Iranian government was severely affected by the epidemic, with around 24 members of Parliament and 15 other current or former politicians infected.</seg>
<seg id="362">On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance, stating that the United States sanctions against Iran had prevented Iran from gaining access to international markets, and that the outbreak of the epidemic had led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal health care for children, paid family visits and increased public health funding.</seg>
<seg id="363">Political analysts predicted that the epidemic might have had a negative impact on the re-election of Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, and that diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea had deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="364">Japan announced that all people entering the country would be subject to two-week quarantine isolation at a government-designated location, and Korea subsequently criticized Japan for "the blurred and passive quarantine measure".</seg>
<seg id="365">Korean society initially showed polarization in the response to the crisis in Tora.</seg>
<seg id="366">Many Koreans signed petitions, some calling for impeachment, blaming the Government for its poor handling of the epidemic, and others for his response strategy, which prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation.</seg>
<seg id="367">Some commentators feared that this could lead to greater government control over power.</seg>
<seg id="368">In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Olban Viktor's indefinite term of office by decree, suspending the Parliament and elections and punishing anyone found to have disseminated false information about the virus and the handling of government crises.</seg>
<seg id="369">The multiple supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of new coronary viruses, resulting from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping, and the disruption of plant and logistics operations worldwide in response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="370">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruption.</seg>
<seg id="371">There have been numerous panic shopping, which has resulted in the emptying of essential items such as food, sanitary paper and bottled water on shelves, resulting in a shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="372">The science and technology industry in particular has also been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.</seg>
<seg id="373">According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandese, the popular demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.</seg>
<seg id="374">This demand has resulted in a 20-fold increase in the price of such products as compared to normal times, and a delay of 4 to 6 months in the supply of medical supplies,</seg>
<seg id="375">It also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization warned would pose a threat to medical personnel.</seg>
<seg id="376">In Australia, Big Brothers offer new opportunities to sell Australian products to China.</seg>
<seg id="377">This resulted in a shortage of infant formula flour in supermarkets, which was then banned by the Australian government, although the COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region were very serious, but there was no serious food shortage in both areas.</seg>
<seg id="378">The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of and illegal trade in key products had been very successful and had averted serious food shortages, which were expected in Europe and North America.</seg>
<seg id="379">Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.</seg>
<seg id="380">The blasting of food shelves was only temporary, even in Wuhan, and pork reserves were released by Chinese government officials to ensure adequate nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="381">Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="382">The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: on 16 March, a media report reported that the first two months of 2020 had been affected by the Government's measures to contain the epidemic and that the Chinese economy had suffered a huge shock, with retail sales falling by 20.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="383">Since mainland China is the world's leading economic and manufacturing centre, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="384">Agathe Demarais of The Economist predicted that the market would remain unstable until there was a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="385">In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS.</seg>
<seg id="386">An expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the impact of the epidemic on global supply chains would be more than $30 billion, possibly for up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="387">It was reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "in a difficult position" after the sharp fall in oil prices due to declining demand in China.</seg>
<seg id="388">On 24 February, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.</seg>
<seg id="389">On 27 February, growing public concern about the new coronary virus epidemic led to the largest decline since 2008 in the US equity indexes, including the NASDAQ 100 index, the S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average, pointing to a drop of 1,191 points, the largest single-day decline since the 2007-08 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="390">All three indices fell by more than 10 per cent during the week.</seg>
<seg id="391">On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.</seg>
<seg id="392">Concerns about new coronary viruses led to a further sharp fall in stock markets, with the largest drop occurring on March 16.</seg>
<seg id="393">The recession was considered a probability event.</seg>
<seg id="394">Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the Central Banks and the states for their timely and urgent measures.</seg>
<seg id="395">The Central Bank's response was faster than the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="396">Tourism is one of the industries most affected by the closure of public places, such as travel bans, tourist attractions, and recommendations from Governments to avoid the impact of travel.</seg>
<seg id="397">As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to declining demand, including British Airlines, China Oriental Airlines and Australian Airlines, while British branch airlines Flybe unfortunately closed.</seg>
<seg id="398">The cruise ship industry has suffered more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="399">Several railway stations and ferry ports were also forced to close.</seg>
<seg id="400">The epidemic coincided with the Spring, which was an important tourist season due to Chinese Spring holidays.</seg>
<seg id="401">The state and local governments cancelled a series of events involving crowd gatherings, including the annual Spring Festival, and private businesses closed shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.</seg>
<seg id="402">Many agricultural New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Palace and the traditional temples, were cancelled and closed to prevent large-scale crowds.</seg>
<seg id="403">Of China's 31 provinces, municipalities directly administered and autonomous regions, 24 extended the new year's leave to 10 February, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.</seg>
<seg id="404">These regions account for 80 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and 90 per cent of exports.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hong Kong, China, raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, suspended school classes until March, and the new year's celebrations were cancelled worldwide, with shops operating for shorter or temporary closures.</seg>
<seg id="406">Retail shop customers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="407">Retail shop customers in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="408">In addition, the epidemic led to a 33-43 per cent decline in shopping centre passenger traffic in March compared to February.</seg>
<seg id="409">Additional measures have been taken by shopping centre operators around the world, such as increasing sanitary facilities and installing thermal scanners to measure shopkeepers' body temperature, as well as the cancellation of activities which, according to estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, could result in an economic recession caused by the pandemic that could result in 14 to 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than they did not have.</seg>
<seg id="410">In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people were unemployed in China.</seg>
<seg id="411">China has nearly 300 million peasant workers, many of whom were left behind in their homes in the inland provinces or in Hubei Province in March 2020, and over 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.</seg>
<seg id="412">According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronary virus epidemic may have left 47 million people unemployed in the United States, and the Indian blockade may have led to the unemployment of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (on a daily basis) as a result of a survey conducted by the Angrid Institute, which found that 44 per cent of Canadian families had experienced some form of unemployment since the Spanish blockade in mid-March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="413">In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for general welfare benefits in Germany, where nearly half a million companies used government-subsidized shorter working hours for their employees.</seg>
<seg id="414">Both France and the United Kingdom have introduced the German Compensatory Work Compensatory System.</seg>
<seg id="415">The Performing and Cultural Industries have also been severely affected by the epidemic, with organizations operating worldwide and employees and individuals not spared.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Arts and Cultural Industries Organization works to uphold its mission (usually funded by the Government), exhibit cultural heritage to the community, preserve the safety of its employees and the public, and provide support to artists wherever possible.</seg>
<seg id="417">By March 2020, museums, libraries, performances and other cultural institutions around the world had to varying degrees been closed indefinitely, and scheduled exhibits, events and performances had to be cancelled or postponed.</seg>
<seg id="418">In response to this situation, efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms have recently led to the cancellation of many religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion performances, and this negative impact is rapidly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="419">The film industry was also hit by the Vatican's announcement to cancel the holy week celebrations to be held in Rome during the last week of Ramadan, Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="420">Many dioceses advised older Christians to stay in their homes and not to attend masses on worship days; some churches held ceremonies on radio, online live or television, and others allowed in-car worship.</seg>
<seg id="421">Due to the closure of the Roman Catholic district's churches, Christian pilgrims were not seen in St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and places of worship.</seg>
<seg id="422">The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic, and the subsequent closure of the holy sites, while Saudi Arabia prohibited foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="423">The pandemic caused the worst damage to the world's sporting agenda since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="424">Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, 2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 U.S. Hockey League season.</seg>
<seg id="425">This eruption disrupted the planned 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled for the end of July; on 24 March the IOC announced that the event would be "restructured beyond 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021 when casinos and other gambling sites around the world were closed and the field poker competition was postponed or cancelled".</seg>
<seg id="426">This led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, and several online gambling websites reported a significant increase in their new registration, with music groups suspending or cancelling touring concerts.</seg>
<seg id="427">Many large theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, also suspended all performances.</seg>
<seg id="428">Some artists have also sought to continue to create and share works through the Internet in lieu of traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or to create a network of "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.</seg>
<seg id="429">On the Internet, many Internet fans with the theme of new coronary viruses are spreading, and with uncertainty spreading, many began to turn to responding with humour and diverting attention.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asian and people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="431">In many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.</seg>
<seg id="432">Many reports this February, when most of the cases were still confined to China, documented racist sentiments against Chinese people from different groups around the world, believing that Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="433">There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei were reportedly subjected to geographical discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="435">Both online and online, there is a voice in favour of Chinese and residents of areas with severe epidemics.</seg>
<seg id="436">As the epidemic spread to other hot spots, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and populations from that country could also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia, and some citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Republic of Korea initially signed petitions requesting a ban on Chinese entry into the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="437">In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese farewell to Japan) topic was widely disseminated by Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="438">Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing racial abuse and attacks.</seg>
<seg id="439">The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticised for calling the new type of coronary virus the "Chinese virus", which critics believed was racially discriminatory and anti-Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ukrainian protesters attacked the bus from Wuhan to Nova Sanzari, carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="441">Students from north-eastern India (bordering China) and attending major cities in India have also reportedly been harassed by the outbreak of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="442">Dileep Gosh, President of West Bengal of the Indian People's Party, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that "there were more emperors to retaliate against them".</seg>

<seg id="1">COVID-19 Workplace Prevention and Control</seg>
<seg id="2">COVID-19 Workplace prevention and control refers to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using occupational safety and health measures to prevent hazards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The adequacy of workplace risk control depends on the specific work site and task and should be based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and risk factors for individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="4">In accordance with the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work has the lowest occupational exposure to the public and other co-workers, and basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouragement of sick employees to live apart from their homes, compliance with respiratory rites and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medium-risk exposure includes work requiring regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of continuous community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">This includes staff working with the general public, such as schools, high-population density working environments and some large-scale retailing environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should use efficient air filters and sneeze protective devices for ventilation, personal protective equipment for exposure to COVID-19 patients and other hazard control measures.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure to medical and encoffinating staff who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that exposure becomes extremely high if the staff performs operations to produce aerosols to known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hazard control measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as pressurized ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work.</seg>
<seg id="10">The COVID-19 outbreak may have serious effects in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff members may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">There may also be changes in business models, including changes in demand for or access to commodities (e.g. shopping at off-peak times, or the use of distribution or exemption from car delivery services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, product logistics from areas of the COVID-19 epidemic may be interrupted by infectious disease prevention and response plans that can be used to guide protection actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">These plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups suffering from chronic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also outline the precautions needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans for the prevention of and response to infectious diseases may need to be subject to national or local recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objectives of the response to the outbreak included reducing inter-staff transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response can be affected by the severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">The hazard control hierarchy is the widely used control framework for occupational safety and health and is used to group hazard control measures according to their effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the COVID-19 hazard cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control is the separation of employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on the behavior of employees, and it is also the least costly solution to implement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative controls refer to changes in work policies or procedures that require staff or employers to take their own action.</seg>
<seg id="23">PPE is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it helps to prevent some exposure.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of PPE are selected according to the level of risk to which the staff member is exposed and are equipped (e.g. respirators), as applicable, and must be worn correctly at all times, regularly inspected and maintained, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="25">Under the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended that all workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, the separation of sick workers from their homes, the observance of breathing instruments when coughing or sneezing, the provision of scarves and garbage buckets, the preparation of remote offices, the staggering of work when necessary, the dissuasion of employees from using tools and equipment of others, and the maintenance of daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="27">The timely identification and segregation of potentially contagious individuals is key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that employees showing acute respiratory symptoms should be separated from their homes for at least 24 hours until it was determined that there was no heat, heat disorder or any other symptoms, and that the sick leave policy should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of sick family members at home and should be clearly informed of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Under OSHA, medium-risk exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m), but which may cause an individual to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of continuous community transmission near the workplace or because of possible recent visits to the COVID-19 epidemic area.</seg>
<seg id="30">Such staff include staff working in schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments who are in contact with the general public, the installation of physical barriers such as efficient air filters, improved ventilation, transparent plastics sneeze protection devices, and the installation of car windows free of charge to provide customer services to this group and high-risk groups, the use of virtual communications in lieu of face-to-face meetings, the elimination of staggered shifts to COVID-19 eruption sites, the development of emergency communication plans, including forums for responding to staff questions, the provision of up-to-date education and training on the risk factors and protective behaviour of COVID-19, the provision of training on the use of protective clothing and protective equipment to staff in need of protective clothing and protective equipment, the provision of resources and working environment that contribute to improving personal hygiene, the requirement of hand-washing,</seg>
<seg id="31">Such staff would ideally need to be equipped with respirators.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the event of an illness on board the aircraft, protective measures shall be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including by placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from the other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing a mask to the patient or requiring the patient to cover the nose with a turban when coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">The crew shall wear a one-time medical glove in the event that the traveller suffers heat, persistent cough or breathing difficulties, and the crew shall wear additional personal protective equipment in the case of sick travellers, touch fluids or potential contaminated surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="34">The gloves and other disposable items should be treated in biological hazard bags, which should then be cleaned and decontaminated on contaminated surfaces, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, and hazard control measures should also include the postponement of travel in the event of sickness, in the event of heat or other symptoms on board the ship, and immediate notification to the medical room on board the ship.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up visits should take place in segregated rooms for schools and childcare facilities, and the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommend the short-term closure of appropriate schools and childcare facilities, regardless of the community's spread, for complete cleaning or disinfection.</seg>
<seg id="36">Social distance strategies such as the cancellation of other large gatherings such as field visits, rallies and sports classes, choirs or cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, staggered and off-site visits, restrictions on unwanted visitor visits, and separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms can be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the case of severe community transmission, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) considers that the immediate health risk to law enforcement personnel carrying out routine activities is low, in addition to social distance strategies.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement officers who must have access to COVID-19 who diagnose a patient or suspect act in accordance with the same level of protection as first-aid medical technicians, including the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the event of close contact during the arrest, the staff member shall clean and sterilize the cashew belt and equipment before it can be cleaned with clean spray or smear from the home and shall comply with the standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA considers that certain health care and encoffoffice staff are exposed to a high or very high risk of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-risk staff include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who are physically exposed to persons known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="42">The risk of exposure becomes extremely high when a staff member implements a foam-generation procedure for a person known or suspected to be in COVID-19, or collects or treats specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="43">Foam generation programs include plug-in, cough-inducing programs, bronchial tube checks, some dental programs and checks, or body specimen collection.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-risk morgue workers include those involved in the corpses of the deceased who were diagnosed or suspected with COVID-19 prior to their life; if an autopsy was performed, additional engineering measures would be required for this risk group, including isolation rooms for COVID-19 diagnosis or suspected cases, including when carrying out the foam-generation procedure.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some health-care facilities and morgues may also be equipped with specialized negative ventilation systems.</seg>
<seg id="46">Bio-safety level 3 precautions should be taken in the handling of specimens.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that different waiting areas be assigned to patients based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases, and that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH) also recommend that persons working within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 patients known or suspected to have been infected, as well as those performing foam-generation procedures, wear respirators.</seg>
<seg id="48">The U.S. requires the use of N95 filters or better masks approved by NIOSH in a comprehensive written respiratory protection program environment such as health testing, training, medical examination, etc.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of respirators provide better protection and improve staff comfort, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">WHO recommends that screening officers at points of entry should wear only medical masks.</seg>
<seg id="51">For staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing foam-generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, glasses or masks, burbes and gloves.</seg>
<seg id="52">If foam-generation procedures are to be implemented, medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks.</seg>
<seg id="53">In view of the global insufficient supply of PPE, WHO recommends that the demand for PPE be reduced through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, access to COVID-19 rooms only for direct care personnel, use of PPE only when it is necessary for a specific task, continued use of the same respirator in the care of multiple patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by people with no symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include heat, cough and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include stress, muscle acid pain, diarrhoea, pharynx pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latency period from exposure to morbidity ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although most cases have minor symptoms, some may develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 17 April 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 22.4 million and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, more than 568,000 people have been rehabilitated through treatment, mainly through close-to-people exposure, often with the spread of the virus from fly foams resulting from cough, sneeze or talk.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the breath may produce flying foams, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface of various objects and do not cause long-range transmission.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, a person may be infected if he or she touchs the surface contaminated by the virus before touching his or her eyes and nose.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the pre- and post-recovery periods may also be transmitted, the standard diagnostic method for the first three days of the disease is the most contagious by conducting real-time RRT-PCR tests in swabs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those suspected to be infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The recommendation to wear masks varies from one place to another, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks and others requesting them.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is no COVID-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment programme available.</seg>
<seg id="15">The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported localized transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic and may also have suspected influenza symptoms, such as heat, cough, weakness and passion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, continuing chest pain or smellness, blurred consciousness, difficulty in awakening and blue face or lips; in the event of such symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneeze, nose or throat pain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, are also monitored at different rates.</seg>
<seg id="20">In some cases in China, only chest torment and heart palpia symptoms were reported.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or even death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call it a latent period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The latency period of COVID-19 is usually 5–6 days, but may extend to 2–14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 97.5 per cent of cases, symptoms were reported within 11.5 days of infection, not all of them.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role played by people with no symptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic has not been fully defined; however, there is prima facie evidence that people with no symptomatic infections may contribute to the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of people with no symptomatic infections has not yet been determined and research is still being intensified at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">The National Board of Health and Health of China has included cases of asymptomatic cases in its daily notification since 1 April; 130 of the 166 cases (78 per cent) occurred on that date.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sputum and saliva carry a large number of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Voice rhetoric is more inflammatory than normal rhetoric.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that unprotected cough could cause the foam to spread 4.5 metres (15 ft) distant.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that they may be transmitted by biosols, and air collectors in the outpatient corridors have detected positive samples of the virus RNA.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as plugging and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may result in aerosolization of the respiratory endocrine.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is also concern that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but this risk is considered to be low, with the virus being most infectious when symptoms occur; although the risk may be low before symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) stated that although the transmission of the new coronary virus was not yet fully known, the virus would generally be transmitted to two to three people, ranging from a few hours to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, new coronavirus is known to survive on paperboard for one day, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on copper products of 99% purity.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its lifetime is also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">If properly used, soap and cleaning agents can also degrade the virus's fat-protection layer by soap products and can also remove the virus from the skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzachloramonium and chlorohexagonate (a surgical disinfection fluid) were less effective than in Hong Kong, China, where saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="39">The first sample of 5/6 patients had the highest viral load, and the second day of 1/6 patients detected the highest viral load.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, first separated from three patients with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory system diseases in Wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the virus entered the human body, it could be killed by domestic soap, as soap could destroy the virus's protective capsule, SARS-CoV-2, which was closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through vascular enzymes conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2), the latter having the highest lung bubbles in type II lung cells.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus binds to the host cell through a special surface glycoprotein known as "sabulus" (cystotic particles) and ACE2.</seg>
<seg id="45">In China, 12% of patients admitted to Wuhan's hospital found acute heart muscle damage and a higher proportion of patients with severe symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="46">Acute heart muscle damage may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor due to the worsening of the condition, overall inflammation and disorders in the immune system, with a high incidence of cardiovascular symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="47">The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in the regulation of heart functions.</seg>
<seg id="48">The higher incidence of CVID-19 (31%) and intravenous embolism (25%) in ICU-guarded patients may be associated with poor prognosis in the autopsy of CCOVID-19 resulting in the discovery of dispersible lung bubble damage (DAD) and lymphocyte inflammation in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although SARS-COV-2 has habits on the respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 sufferers suffer from full-body hyperinflammation.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, the CCOVID-19 pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells are associated with inflammatory IL-6 monocrine cell collection and severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">The autopsy report also saw lymphocyte immersion.</seg>
<seg id="52">WHO has published several disease detection programmes.</seg>
<seg id="53">The standard test method is the real-time reversal of the recorded polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test usually tests respiratory samples obtained through nose swabs; however, nose swabs or sputum samples can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests may also be carried out, but two weeks between two samples are required, the result of which is almost no immediate value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing agents to detect the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (not only for active infections, but also for individuals who had previously contracted the virus) is still under development but has not been replicated.</seg>
<seg id="59">According to China's experience, the accuracy of the tests was only 60 to 70 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="60">On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first instant diagnostic reagent, and the Diagnostic Guide issued by Wuhan University's Mid-South Hospital at the end of the year proposed methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.</seg>
<seg id="61">Early infections were mostly bipolar follicular glass, with asymmetries and later layers in the outside.</seg>
<seg id="62">As the virus develops, there may be chest downward appearance, gravel trajectories (with increased leaf spacing with varying degrees of lung bubble enrichment) and lung variability.</seg>
<seg id="63">Little information is available on COVID-19 micro-pathological damage and path physiology.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main pathological findings of the autopsy were as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Eye examination: chest inflammation, cardiac inflammation, lung variability and pulmonary oedema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four critical levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Light pneumonia: oedema of the pulmonary, increased lung cells, large amounts of atypical lung cells, lymphocyte leaching associated with mesopitis and formation of poly nucleic giant cells</seg>
<seg id="68">Heavy pneumonia: Breakable pulmonary bubble damage (DAD) Permeating fluid with diffuse pulmonary bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="69">DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Restitution pneumonia: fluid infiltration of the bubble cavity and inter lung fibrosis</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: dispersible blood tubular condensation (DIC); young white-child red cell reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the incidence of infection include staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="73">The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended covering the nose with a paper scarf when coughing or sneezing, and in the absence of a paper scarf, using the elbow side.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended that manual hygiene be properly cleaned after coughing or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">The CDC proposes to wear masks in public and to some extent to prevent the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic patients, the core of its social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public gatherings, thereby reducing the access of infected persons to large groups.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, social distance guidelines provide for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) in interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no drugs for the effective prevention of COVID-19, since it is expected that vaccines will not be developed until at least 2021, so efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, the "epidemiological curve" that we know.</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the CDC advised people to wash hand with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there was visible sludge, such as after the toilet or in the hands, before cooking, and after sneezing, cough or sneeze.</seg>
<seg id="79">In addition, it is recommended that hand washing be done with at least 60% alcohol content, but only in areas where there is no soap and piped water available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity by ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand-to-hand disinfecting active substance".</seg>
<seg id="82">Glycerine is added as a wet agent.</seg>
<seg id="83">Providing people with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other critical organ support affected.</seg>
<seg id="84">CDC recommends that suspected carriers wear improvised masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">The in vitro membrane oxygen hybrid (ECMO) has been introduced to alleviate the symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits remain to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to improve immunization by maintaining hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyles and dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the case of patients with early minor infections, support for sex therapy may be effective, with the initiative of WHO and the National Health and Health Commission of China calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="88">United States specialists in critical pathology and lungs have compiled the recommendations for treatment made by the agencies and made them available free of charge through the IBCC.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy had been developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">In response to some symptoms, some medical experts recommended the use of thermal pain (acetyl aminophenol) instead of Bloven for first-line treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as plugging or handling, with particular attention to protection.</seg>
<seg id="92">With regard to medical personnel caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommended that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure and airborne preventive measures, patients should be transferred to the Airborne Infectious Diseases Separation Room (AIIR), which provided an overview of the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended equipment: PPE Protective suits, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves, if available, preferably respirators (rather than masks).</seg>
<seg id="94">The N95 masks were authorized for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the emergency use authorization (EUA).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is used primarily to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but cannot be used for other uses to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the absence of a mask, the CDC recommends the use of a mask and, if necessary, a self-propelled mask.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most COVID-19 cases have lower symptoms and do not require the use of mechanical gas or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Medical staff are actively working on research to provide respiratory support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms, with evidence that nose-flow oxygen therapy or double-phase gas-pressure venting can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is not clear whether the two treatment programmes mentioned above will have the same effect on patients with serious illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="100">If the conditions permit, some physicians prefer to use mechanical flux, as this technique also limits the spread of aerosol particles to older persons (especially those over 80 years of age) as compared to nasal flow oxygen therapy.</seg>
<seg id="101">In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient and the health-care system is unable to cope with the serious situation in which hospitalization is required as a result of the surge in COVID-19 cases, given medical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients needed to be sent to the intensive care unit, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical airing, and 1.4 per cent would die.</seg>
<seg id="103">About 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in China were eventually admitted to ICU.</seg>
<seg id="104">With the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, mechanical flux complications increased and oxygen complications increased.</seg>
<seg id="105">A pressure control mode and a high PEEP respirator are then required to maximize oxygen transmission, while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest damage caused by the respirator.</seg>
<seg id="106">Old respirators may not be able to achieve high PEEP.</seg>
<seg id="107">Since January 2020, potential therapies have been studied, and a number of antiviral drugs are now in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="108">Ridsewe appears to be one of the most potent drugs at present.</seg>
<seg id="109">While new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced stages of testing.</seg>
<seg id="110">People with severe illness may try to use antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="111">WHO called on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapeutic efficacy and safety tests, and the FDA has granted temporary authorization to restore blood plasma transfusions as experimental treatments for people with serious life-threatening conditions.</seg>
<seg id="112">The necessary clinical research to demonstrate the safe and effective treatment of the disease has not yet been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="113">In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="114">Users are required to enter names and identification numbers as required.</seg>
<seg id="115">This application is capable of detecting "close contact" by monitoring data to determine the potential risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="116">Each user can also check the status of the other three users.</seg>
<seg id="117">Once potential risks are detected, the application not only advises self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials on the combined use of big data analysis, facial identification techniques, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected persons and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="118">In March 2020, the Government of Israel approved the tracking of cell phone data by security agencies for suspected coronary virus carriers.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of this measure is to impose segregation and to protect groups that may be in contact with infected citizens.</seg>
<seg id="120">Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregated cell phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute of the German Federal Government in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Russian Federation has deployed facial identification techniques to detect persons who violate the separation provisions.</seg>
<seg id="122">According to the Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera, "40% of citizens are still moving around".</seg>
<seg id="123">The German government hosted a 48-hour hacking marathon with over 42,000 participants.</seg>
<seg id="124">In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for innovative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="125">Separation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of infection, all of which may be disruptive.</seg>
<seg id="126">The BBC cited Rory O'Connor's view that "social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harmed people's mental health and well-being".</seg>
<seg id="127">The disease is moderate, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="128">Minor cases can usually be recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.</seg>
<seg id="129">Data from other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS) show that pregnant women are at higher risk of developing into COVID-19 patients, but lack of COVID-19 data support may have an impact on the lungs of some people, leading to pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="130">In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="131">CoVID-19-related complications include septicaemia, condensation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.</seg>
<seg id="132">In 6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital there were condensation abnormalities, especially the extended time of the condensation enzyme, while in 4% of the group there were kidney abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="133">About 20–30% of COVID-19 patients have liver enzymes (transaminases) elevated.</seg>
<seg id="134">According to the same report, the average time from illness to death was 10 days, of which the average time from hospitalization was 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="135">However, the average time between hospitalization and death of patients transferred to ICU is seven days.</seg>
<seg id="136">Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.</seg>
<seg id="137">A study by the China National Council for Health and Health (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.</seg>
<seg id="138">The organopathological examination of the body anatomy of the lungs showed that both lungs were secreted with diffuse pulmonary bubbles and fibres of the cellular fibrosis.</seg>
<seg id="139">Pulmonary cells observed viral cellular pathologies.</seg>
<seg id="140">Pulmonary images are similar to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</seg>
<seg id="141">Of the deaths reported by China's National Board of Health and Health, 11.8 per cent resulted in heart damage due to higher calcium muscle protein levels or sudden cardiac stops.</seg>
<seg id="142">According to data released in the United States in March, 89 per cent of institutionalized patients had a history of medical resource availability and regional socio-economic conditions, which could also affect mortality.</seg>
<seg id="143">Estimates of disease mortality vary according to regional differences and methodological difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="144">An underestimation of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, if the death is due to prior infections, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="146">Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into COVID-19 than non-smokers, and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or death.</seg>
<seg id="147">The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that the lung activity of some of the rehabilitated persons had decreased by 20% to 30%, and lung scanning showed organ damage.</seg>
<seg id="148">In addition, rehabilitation may be subject to post-custodial syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="149">As of March 2020, it was uncertain whether previous infections would provide effective long-lasting immunization for those recovering.</seg>
<seg id="150">Other coronary virus behavioural characteristics suggest that it may be immune, but some COVID-19 cases are reported to have been tested positive shortly after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="151">These cases are considered to be worsening and not re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is considered a natural virus, which originates in animals and is infected through spills.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origin has not been determined, but as of December 2019, almost all infections were interpersonal.</seg>
<seg id="154">In January 2020, the Lancet published the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 case studies, which showed that the earliest cases occurred on 1 December 2019.</seg>
<seg id="155">WHO The earliest date of morbidity reported in official publications is December 8, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="156">Mortality rates are usually quantified using several methods.</seg>
<seg id="157">These figures vary from region to region and change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as measurement, quality of the health system, treatment programmes, timing of the first outbreak and age, gender and general health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, WHO designated ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Deaths, and U07.2 for clinical or epidemiological diagnostic infections COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 Deaths without laboratory confirmation, divided by the total number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).</seg>
<seg id="160">A number of other measurements vary from region to region, including case mortality (CFR), which reflects the number of deaths due to illness as a percentage of those diagnosed, and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the number of deaths due to illness as a percentage of the number of infections (including those diagnosed and not diagnosed).</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics are not time-limited and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific population groups.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected persons produce antibodies, the existence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="163">The Italian Epidemiological Center Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of only 4,600, and 80 (1.7%) have died of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="164">In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival festivals and even to young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.</seg>
<seg id="165">In addition, the German medical system is already overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="166">Blood donors' assessments indicate that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="167">To date, 69 persons (0.004 per cent of the total population) have been confirmed to have died in COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary according to sex.</seg>
<seg id="169">Studies in China and Italy have shown that the mortality rate for men is higher than for women.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men between 50 and 60 years of age have the highest risk of death, with only the gender gap in the 90 years of age being similar.</seg>
<seg id="171">China has a male mortality rate of 2.8 per cent and a female mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact causes of such gender differences are not yet clear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-based immunological differences, lower rates of smoking among women and lower age for men with complications such as hypertension, have resulted in higher mortality among men than among women.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57 per cent of infected men and 72 per cent of all deaths due to COVID-19 are men.</seg>
<seg id="175">As of April 2020, the U.S. Government had not followed the COVID-19 gender-related data on infection.</seg>
<seg id="176">Studies have shown that viral diseases such as the Ebola virus, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.</seg>
<seg id="177">The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher and the rate of exposure to the virus is also higher.</seg>
<seg id="178">On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease "COVID-19".</seg>
<seg id="179">The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained this: CO's "champion", VI's "virus", D's "Disease", and 19's first outbreak (December 31, 2019).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or population, in line with the international nomenclature recommendation to prevent stigmatization, leading to the virus known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Crown Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus that causes COVID-19" in mass communication.</seg>
<seg id="182">Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="183">During the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "champion virus" and "wuhan champion virus".</seg>
<seg id="184">In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as temporary virus and disease names, based on the 2015 Guidelines on the Positioning of Diseases and Viral Names.</seg>
<seg id="185">On February 11, 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.</seg>
<seg id="186">Given the capacity constraints of the standard supply chain, a number of digital manufacturers have started printing health-care materials such as nose swabs and respiratory parts.</seg>
<seg id="187">For example, an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilation valve, the supplier could not deliver the parts within the required time, a local start-up company carried out reverse works and 100 ventilation valves were printed overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were quickly spread through the network.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans appear to be able to spread the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">No evidence of virus replication has been found in pigs, duck and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of this disease have yet been approved.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research and development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="193">In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidarity Pilot" to assess therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects.</seg>
<seg id="194">Vaccines are not yet available, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entered human cells via ACE2 receptors, the previous work of SARS-CoV was needed.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers plan to develop all-viral vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at stimulating a rapid immune response in the case of new infections of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is the development of subunit vaccines, aimed at developing a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies have focused on S gillin in ACE2 enzyme receptors with auxiliary viral intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is the development of a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technique).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccine developed by the strategies mentioned above must be tested, and on 16 March 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical vaccine trials.</seg>
<seg id="203">Vaccines contain sound genetic sequences from the replication of disease-induced viruses, which have been argued to be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven trials were evaluated and approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">The conversion of antiviral drug use accounts for the vast majority of research in China, and nine third-stage clinical trials on Ridhewee will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="207">As of April 2020, a state-of-the-art review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated and several available antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment are currently being evaluated, including Ridsewe, Chloroquine and Hydrochloroquine, Lopinaway/Litonaway and Lopinaway/Litonaway combinations of interruptors β.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of March 2020, therapeutic efficacy of Radhive has been initially confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">The clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate medication were observed to have been mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="210">The United States, China and Italy are currently conducting a three-stage clinical trial in February 2020, and China started a chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) study with preliminary results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there was a call for a peer review of the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommended the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, the Wuhan Institute of Viral Sciences recommended taking 1 g per day, while alerting two times the dose to be very dangerous and possibly fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorizations for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors had the right to decide whether to use the two substances mentioned above for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The seventh edition of the Chinese guide also proposed the use of jamming, Libawelin or Abidor hydrochloride for the treatment of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data indicate that the high dose Libavelin was in vitro inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in vivo studies using nitrazonite have been recommended, suggesting that transmembrane protease filin 2 (TMPRSS2)-induced primitive glycerin is a necessary condition for SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 receptors to enter the human body.</seg>
<seg id="217">Both chloroquine and hydrochloroquine studies have serious limitations in combination with Achillomycin, and unless further studies have taken place, Osthetavier has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not been found to have therapeutic effect on COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms may become complications in COVID-19 patients for later treatment.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydroxy chloroquine may have an anti-cell-factor storm characteristic, and after a small study, the National Health Board of China has included the pearl resistance in its treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="220">Following the positive test results for patients with serious symptoms, Italy is conducting a national 2nd non-random test.</seg>
<seg id="221">Combined with serum iron protein blood testing, identification of cytokine storms is intended to contain disease development, while cytokine storms are thought to cause death in some of the infected people.</seg>
<seg id="222">In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of white-cell diabetes 6 receptor antagonists for the treatment of the artificial cytokine release syndrome for steroids caused by other causes, the CAR T cell therapy.</seg>
<seg id="223">To date, there has been no random cross-checking evidence that the beads are resistant to the effective treatment of CRS.</seg>
<seg id="224">Pure enrichment antibodies from the COVID-19 vaccination system are being studied for people in need of antibodies as passive immunotherapy before successful vaccine development.</seg>
<seg id="225">SARS has attempted this strategy during the outbreak, but the efficacy of the treatment has not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="226">The virus is also an intended mechanism for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 immune defense in passive antibody therapy.</seg>
<seg id="227">However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, can achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="228">Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of man-made monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.</seg>
<seg id="229">The amount of serum production during the rehabilitation period may increase, and it may facilitate the rapid deployment of serum consisting of a liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which contains specific antibodies for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="230">Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndrome</seg>
<seg id="231">Li Wen Liang, a physician at Wuhan City Central Hospital, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, which was later unfortunately contracted with COVID-19 and died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shops in Australia reduced the ceiling on the number of sanitary paper per transaction</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday and Saturday night, Australia's chain shops Woolworths and Cooles nationwide reduced the ceiling for each of their shops to two bags and one bags for the purchase of sanitary paper.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALDI also introduced a limit on the purchase of a package on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the silver counter or on the Facebook page that is released to the chain store.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was reported that buyers hoarded goods for fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from having to isolate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Woolworths will also limit the purchase of sanitary paper for delivery to the door to a single package.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Cooles introduced a four-package limit for each transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a press release on 8 March, Coles reported that following the four-package restriction, "many stores were sold out within one hour of arrival" and that the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI stated in the Facebook post on Tuesday that it was "unavailable".</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a spokesman for Woolworths, the sales volume of the previous week was "rapidly increased".</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, the Costa shop in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two bags.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further mitigate the shortfall, Coles ordered more packaging from the vendor and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, and ALDI prepared its stock for the planned Wednesday specialization.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said that retailers attempted to increase their stock, but this was made difficult by the local council's restrictions on truck delivery times.</seg>
<seg id="13">He anticipated that production costs would increase as suppliers tried to meet their needs, while preferential activities would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, ALDI announced that it would not be possible for some stores to hold Wednesday excavations after the early release of stocks.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Science and Technology of Queensland, stated that the store would replenish the stock every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said that sanitary paper was a large piece of items and was therefore relatively small in stock and that once sold out, it would leave large shelves space, adding to the perception of shortages.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Coles and Woolworths argue that if there is much on the shelves, goods such as cylinder paper and hand washing fluids can be [built] and sufficient, you may not be so panicy."</seg>
<seg id="18">The manufacturer of recycled sanitary paper, Who Gives a Crap, stated last Wednesday that they were no longer in stock.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a comfortable sanitary paper, and Solaris Paper, a Sorbent sanitary paper, both stressed that they were working all day and on weekends to ensure supplies.</seg>
<seg id="20">The real estate website Domain.com reported that the first bidder was provided with free sanitary paper at auction in Melbourne because buyers rested on the weekends of labour festivals and fewer auctions were held.</seg>
<seg id="21">The NT News is a daily newspaper printed in the city of Darwin and contains eight pages of spots in its Thursday edition, which is intended to be used as sanitary paper after cutting.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to ABC Australia on 3 March, the shops were initially reluctant to implement the purchase restrictions, and they said they had no plans to enforce them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand washing fluids, dry goods, hand washing fluids and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Similarly, outside Australia, the UK's online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres sanitary paper to two bags of 12 volumes each on Sunday night.</seg>

<seg id="2">All employees of the Wikimedia Foundation</seg>
<seg id="3">Theme: [Covid-19] Lightly loaded and prepared for the future</seg>
<seg id="4">Date/time of transmittal: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC</seg>
<seg id="5">License: CC0: No rights reserved</seg>
<seg id="6">We have faced some difficult circumstances since this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the CVID-19 epidemic, we have clearly felt solidarity with the destiny of all humankind, while also recognizing our responsibilities towards each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to them requires people around the world to feel together, work together and promote community-building, which is the core philosophy of Wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="9">The transmission of friendship and care among all colleagues through e-mails, telephones and chats is ample proof of the difference in the revelations of our colleagues and how fortunate we are to work with you.</seg>
<seg id="10">I can count on my gratitude and pride as colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They made me aware that the use of Wikipedia by the world at this juncture was a meaningful event, while at the same time making me aware of the symbolic power that this vital resource has brought to the people of the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your work is in charge of website operations, payment of salaries or community safety, the normal operation of Wikimedia will not require your hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">More than ever before, the world needs information from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, the content of our work, and even the way we work, will have an important impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities that colleagues have to shoulder, we will begin next week to make some important adjustments to our modus operandi.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adjustment of working methods and timetable</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn had previously mentioned, the senior management team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and schedule for the next few days to months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At that meeting, we considered what we saw as appropriate responses to the current challenges facing companies, as well as best practices to ensure their sustainable development during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="20">The senior management team agreed to relieve pressure on the company's staff so that they could support the company's mission over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you in alleviating the pressure on your work appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contractors:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week) and follow up if changes occur.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a leave notice, and if you can work longer every day, we will give you the task in accordance with the length of your work.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as family care, out-of-pocket shopping or medical consultations.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will not follow your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are sick, please leave your job.</seg>
<seg id="28">While this is self-evident, we would like to remind you and assure you.</seg>
<seg id="29">You do not need sick or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and assist your team in revising the work calendar and schedule to ensure that critical areas of work are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of the talent and cultural operations department, which will support you and ensure that your situation is duly taken into account by the management.)</seg>
<seg id="31">For current-paid employees, we will pay the full salary.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already expressed and renewed our commitment to honouring the commitments made to contractors and hourly workers.</seg>
<seg id="33">The salaries we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of the compensation they receive in the normal course of working hours.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if you are sick or unable to work, this is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many chose to communicate with the outside world through work and to release their pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in the current period.</seg>
<seg id="38">But caring for himself is still the first.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can get up to date and adjust accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Priority is given to ensuring that important work is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="41">We must maintain the normal functioning of some important work.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work of the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and others) is essential and may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will begin to assess the current objectives with all sectors and will shift our focus to supporting a number of matters that are essential to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is much to be done by all of us, but we all need to focus on the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="45">A temporary slowdown would not affect future development.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not intend to "work overtime to catch up" after the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="47">We will not ask you to catch up with your work overtime, which now seems impractical.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed and that we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">What is the change in the APP (annual plan)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working hours, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time to be allocated to the preparation of the budget to enable staff to prioritize critical work and care for themselves and their families, and to adjust working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="52">An extension of the schedule would significantly reduce the current planned workload across the Organization and reduce the pressure on work.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will submit the above proposals to the Board next week, and if they are adopted, we will update the programme of work for follow-up to delegates and teams as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thank the APP team for its leadership in this process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office conditions, exposure and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the CVID-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, out of caution, we have hired a number of anti-virus cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="58">Using a hospital-level sterilization solution, they disinfected various surfaces as well as halls and elevators leading to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The office building is fulfilling its due diligence agreement, using the corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are confident that the Office is fully prepared to welcome you when you decide to return to work.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington, D.C., office uses the WeWork office, which shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and with all Washington, D.C. staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to full-time remote office, in accordance with the guidance we had shared with the San Francisco office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some New York office colleagues already know, we have been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn area.</seg>
<seg id="64">These discussions are still ongoing but may be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="65">For the first time, some colleagues were exposed to telecommuting.</seg>
<seg id="66">Other long-distance colleagues would like to offer them some suggestions for modus operandi adjustments:</seg>
<seg id="67">Meeting time should be kept within one to two hours.</seg>
<seg id="68">If more time is needed, please consider decentralizing the content of the meetings to more than one session.</seg>
<seg id="69">Clearly define the objectives of the meeting, set the agenda for the meeting and send reading material in advance.</seg>
<seg id="70">Videoconferencing is used as a default meeting modality, along with online collaboration and networking using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.</seg>
<seg id="71">In each of these meetings, a moderator presides over the meetings, a person is responsible for monitoring the questioning in the chat window and following changes in the list of speakers, and another person is responsible (or working in a multi-player manner) for assisting with the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="72">If you need a comfortable headphone, please send an e-mail to contact the technical support department.</seg>
<seg id="73">Do you use your health subsidy to buy zero food.</seg>
<seg id="74">Addition of #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues</seg>
<seg id="75">The Human Resources Operating Team is studying manual engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues improve their efficiency during distributed office hours.</seg>
<seg id="76">Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editorial loos, before WHO announced the end of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="77">These requests for the lifting of activities and other restrictions may prevent recipients in these communities from carrying out their intended contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this while also pledging that no one of them will be penalized for postponing or modifying these objectives.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the following week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional and thematic community meetings.</seg>
<seg id="79">The global community now appears to be masked by the devastation caused by the epidemic, but it also reflects comfort in being able to maintain a clear interest in their respective communities, Wikimedia and others.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the future, the CRT team will set up a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide the community with a space to monitor impacts and track the community's communication with us.</seg>
<seg id="81">Keeping in touch and communicating COVID-19-related issues</seg>
<seg id="82">We plan to hold a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 (Heart of the World) at 07:00 (Pacific Time), and we will send an invitation to you in your calendar later.</seg>
<seg id="83">At that meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and allow some time for an exchange of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="84">We are united in our efforts to help you here.</seg>
<seg id="85">At the same time, you can get more information about this e-mail and other important information about COVID-19 on Office Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="86">The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and bring all the information together in one place.</seg>
<seg id="87">We are seeking to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries/areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="88">Please contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time if you have any doubts about travel, activities, main workflows or insurance, or other assistance is required.</seg>
<seg id="89">We are here to provide you with the necessary support and liaison.</seg>
<seg id="90">If you have an intimate or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, head of the global human resources operation.</seg>
<seg id="91">While we face these changes, we cannot abandon our work and our obligations.</seg>
<seg id="92">On the contrary, the epidemic has taught us that we may now need to adapt our work and obligations in a way that has not been done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="93">We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in continuing to complete their work, to provide the support needed for our actions and to continue to bring to the world the services on which they depend.</seg>
<seg id="94">It is time to plan well so as not to be afraid of challenges.</seg>
<seg id="95">We are now invited to support one another and to work together to create space for important work in the coming weeks or even months.</seg>
<seg id="96">We need all to contribute to that goal, and we are therefore invited to take care of ourselves and their families in order to remain in the best position when needed.</seg>
<seg id="97">Finally, we would like to keep in mind the need to wash hands and not to face.</seg>
<seg id="98">Katherine, the CRT teams (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N) are saluted.</seg>

<seg id="1">The need to update COVID-19 diagnostic standards for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases"</seg>
<seg id="2">On February 6, 2020, our team released the "Guide to Rapid Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Crown Viruses (2019-nCoV) Infections", through which we provided experience and lessons for the global response to the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, and our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical experience; diagnostic and treatment strategies are therefore constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic standards for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Clinical Program (seventh edition) issued by the National Health and Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="5">In December 2019, a new type of coronary virus (2019-nCoV) erupted, and the disease is now officially known as the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), formerly known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="7">To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a fast-track advice guide, which was released online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06.2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since its publication, it has attracted wide-ranging attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new type of disease whose awareness is gradually increasing, based on ongoing research and clinical experience; diagnostic and treatment strategies are therefore constantly being updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Commission on Health and Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published a total of seven editions of the COVID-19 Clinical Programme between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our guide now receives comments from Zhou et al. who have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to this global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We acknowledge their important work and thank them for it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their proposals, however, also need to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 Clinic Programme (Pilot Seventh Edition) and recent studies.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the identification of suspected cases requires a combination of an epidemiological history characteristic and two clinical expressions for a comprehensive analysis, and in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations need to be met:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiological history: (1) Travel or residence history in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 cases within 14 days prior to the symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 infection (nuclear acid test positive); (3) contact history with people with heat or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the symptoms; (4) contact history with concentrated confirmed cases (within 2 weeks prior to the symptoms, with ≥ 2 cases of heat and/or respiratory symptoms, e.g. at home, office, school class, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical performance: (1) Heat and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) Imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Normal or reduced total number of white cells in the early stages of morbidity and reduction of lymphocyte counts.</seg>
<seg id="18">The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on a suspected case with any of the following pathogen or serum evidence: (1) SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test positive; (2) Viral whole genome sequencing showing a known high congener of the new coronary virus; (3) Specification of IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies in serum tests for SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2 specificity IgG antibodies converted from vaginal to positive or increased by ≥4 times the droplet during the recovery period.</seg>
<seg id="19">We can see the addition of real-time PCR nucleic acid testing in the respiratory or blood specimens in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions added blood specimen pathogen tests, followed by serological evidence in the seventh edition.</seg>
<seg id="21">These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to study the best test kits for nucleic acid testing for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood extraction, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, there is growing evidence reminding us of atypical and asymptomatic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flow charts of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we would like to see more direct evidence and call for comments from the reader.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that the latest guidelines for the country in which the case is located be consulted and followed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also provide assistance by updating our guide in a timely manner.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bangladesh reported 5 new COVID-19 deaths, a single-day high</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.</seg>
<seg id="3">This has resulted in a new high rate of single-day deaths due to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="4">As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR) had reported 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases were treated after rest at home.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cumulatively 17 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6">At an online press conference, the head of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, stated that the deaths included four men and one woman.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were between the ages of 60 and 60, two between the ages of 51 and one between the ages of 41 and 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also stated that two of the dead were from Dhaka.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (pandemic).</seg>
<seg id="10">A hospital officer told the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh, who had been treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced via an online video that public transport stops would be extended beyond the initial schedule to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The public transport shutdown began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.</seg>
<seg id="13">Essential goods, such as medical care, fuel and food, remain routinely transported.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 8 March, of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and one patient was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of 19 March, all three patients had been rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the continued outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) as a major epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the term "great epidemic" refers only to the extent of the disease's spread and not to the degree of risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge Governments to take measures to:</seg>
<seg id="4">"All countries/regions can still change the course of this pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, should each country/area test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize its people as a response.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction".</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented".</seg>
<seg id="8">In February, he commented in CNN that "no respiratory virus, other than influenza, has been found to continue to spread to the world since its occurrence".</seg>
<seg id="9">Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronary virus before."</seg>
<seg id="10">He went on to say, "Similarly, we have never seen a controllable viral epidemic before."</seg>
<seg id="11">Before entering the new state of the pandemic, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said the outbreak, "most importantly, it is still deteriorating".</seg>
<seg id="13">By Thursday, the Associated Press had reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Coronary respiratory virus disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory tests include testing for the presence of the virus and for the creation of antibodies after infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR can detect the coronary virus's RNA and thus determine whether the virus is present in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is a specific test for SARS-CoV-2 viruses RNA.</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be used to determine whether there has been a recent infection or whether there has been an active infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody testing (blood serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with minor symptoms that have not been reported or asymptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results of this test determine the exact death rate of the disease, as well as the level of immunization among the population groups.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/area had been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population.</seg>
<seg id="9">As at 23 March, no country/area had more than 3 per cent of its population tested, and there were significant differences in the measurements completed by each country/area.</seg>
<seg id="10">This discrepancy may also seriously affect the reported case mortality rate, which in some countries may be grossly overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="11">A real-time RRT-PCR test using throat swabs will yield reliable results only within the first week of the virus infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RT-PCR test, carried out with swabs, can yield reliable results only within the first week after the virus has been infected.</seg>
<seg id="14">The virus then disappears in the throat, but continues to breed in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Samples may be replaced with deep respiratory extracts from the sputum tubes or with pertussis (sputum) for those who are tested in the second week of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="16">In January 2020, rRT-PCR was released at Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests and served as the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 23, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It searches for all "E" genes common to β coronary viruses, as well as the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp genes in China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from the National Drug Control Administration of China for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the new 2019 coronary viruses (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories in the United States through the International Reagent Resource Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">Early versions of the test agent cassette used three genetic tests, one of which was unable to determine the results due to reagent defects, while Atlanta's CDC experienced detection bottlenecks; this resulted in less than 100 samples being successfully processed every day throughout February 2020.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was not until 28 February 2020 that a two-part test was determined to be reliable and the state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the basis of emergency use authorizations, and the U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="22">LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing could be carried out nationwide from March 5, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics also announced that COVID-19 testing would be available nationwide from 9 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="24">Quantity limits were not announced; sample collection and processing had to be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, COVID-19 tests are developed and produced by the National Centre for virology and Biotechnology Research (VECTOR).</seg>
<seg id="26">On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Inspectorate on 12 March 2020, and it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test box for COVID-19 infection, a test method approved by the FDA on 13 March 2020 for Roche Diagnostics, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours so that a device could undergo approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing with the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.</seg>
<seg id="28">On March 21, 2020, an approximate 45-minute test for Cepheid was also authorized by the FDA for emergency use.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has approved a test method for replacing PCR with thermal augmentation technologies such as nucleic acid.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the method does not require a series of temperature cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes and negative outcomes in 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">About 18,000 such devices are currently available in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is developing a test method using monoclon antibodies (specialized with new coronary virus nuclear crust protein (N protein), which is expected to be available within 15 to 20 minutes as rapid influenza tests.</seg>
<seg id="32">A March 2020 review of literature concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of chests is very low and CT [computer fault scanning] may be apparent even before symptoms occur".</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features of CT include double pulmonary leaf glass glass, which is asymmetric and later layout.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, there will be the development of chest downplay, gravel traps and lung variability.</seg>
<seg id="35">A PCR and CT study comparing Wuhan (where the current pandemic first erupted) showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate, and many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of March 2020, the U.S. Radiology Society recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19", and that the CDC recommended using the PCR for initial screening as of March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to the infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections around 7 days after the start of symptoms, to determine the immune status of the monitored population, either at the central laboratory (CLT) or via immediate testing (PoCT).</seg>
<seg id="39">High flux automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by serial sampling, it is usually measured using an outer circumference blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="41">For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained by skin-piercing.</seg>
<seg id="42">On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the testing method for 29 entities which are now able to distribute their anti-examination test kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test on the basis of an emergency use authorization, and in late March 2020, Epitope Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics' test kits were approved in Europe for the testing of IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours of detection capacity, and thus much faster than conventional PCR tests on the virus RNA.</seg>
<seg id="45">In general, antibodies could be detected 14 days after the infection began, and in early April, the UK found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased was useful enough.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has established a mechanism under which suspected patients can live in the home, "the emergency room provides the patient with a sample test tube", where the patient spits saliva to the test tube and then sends the tube back, and the UK NHS announces that it will pilot a program to detect suspected cases in the home, which will eliminate the risk that the patient will be infected with another person while travelling to the hospital, or that the ambulance will have to be sterilized after the patient's use of an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Exemption Testing Centre has helped Korea to carry out the most extensive and faster tests than other countries, and on 2 March the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors (NASHM) indicated that non-inpatient institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day and that 10,700 tests had been conducted the previous week.</seg>
<seg id="48">In the case of testing at the request of a doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the total detection capacity in Germany is 160,000 copies per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of 19 March, free testing has been provided in several major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only the number of positive tests had been reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial laboratory survey showed that 483,295 samples (including 12 weeks 2020) had been detected as of the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive in Israel, and researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of 64 patients, i.e. summary samples, and only further testing was carried out in Wuhan, where the Big Genome (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 flatmeter emergency laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was put into use on 5 February 2020 and could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.</seg>
<seg id="53">The laboratory was built on 5 days under the supervision of the founder of the Chinese genome Wang, and modelling showed that if the above detection capacity was not achieved, the Hubei case would have been 47 per cent higher and the corresponding isolation would have been doubled.</seg>
<seg id="54">Immediately after the Wuhan Laboratory, the Fire Eye Laboratory was established in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, and 12 cities in China have now established the Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="55">By March 4, 2020, the laboratory had a total of 50,000 open-source, multi-circuit designs released by Origami Assays, and these equilibrium designs could be tested for up to 1,122 patient samples in small laboratories without automatic fluid transfer.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the USA.</seg>
<seg id="57">This led some sponsors to explore sample preparation programmes involving heating samples up to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing, and on 31 March the United Arab Emirates announced that it had now carried out new coronavirus testing for more people than any other country and was expanding testing levels to allow large numbers of people to undergo testing.</seg>
<seg id="58">This test capability is achieved through the use of drive-through testing, on the one hand, and the provision of funds to the Group 42 and the Chinese genes (based on their "Fire Eye" Emergency Test Laboratory in China) for the establishment of high-volume laboratories to respond to the needs of large crowds.</seg>
<seg id="59">The laboratory was completed within 14 days and is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the first in the world to operate on such a scale outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronary virus gene map.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German method of producing test kits to send them to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent kits.</seg>
<seg id="62">The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the program developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) will not be available until 28 January, limiting the ability of China and the United States to meet problems with the reliability of test-agent boxes at an early stage of the outbreak, and both countries and Australia are unable to provide sufficient test boxes to meet the needs and test recommendations made by health experts.</seg>
<seg id="63">Conversely, experts found that extensive testing in the Republic of Korea would be useful in reducing the spread of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, its main concentration is in laboratories in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="65">On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for additional testing programmes as the best way to mitigate the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, resulting in a high demand for testing, which led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the availability of swabs and chemical reagents began to become tense.</seg>
<seg id="66">In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kits.</seg>
<seg id="67">In the United States, test kits developed by CDC had "defects"; subsequently, the government removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing, and Spain purchased them from the Chinese company Shenzhen Erie Biotechnology Ltd. and found the results inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explained that the inaccurate results of the tests could be the result of the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of test kits.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish Cabinet stated that the reagent boxes would be recovered and replaced with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China, and that the results were incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test boxes should be thrown into the Danube River, and Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China were "highly erroneous" and that the UK had purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and declared them unusable in April 2020.</seg>
<seg id="71">Positive results can be obtained by testing and segregating those who test positive and tracking the history of SARS-CoV-2 positive exposure.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò (the first case of COVID-19 in Italy) carried out two rounds of testing for a group of approximately 3,400 people, each for about 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them tested positive and asymptomatic, and all cases found were segregated.</seg>
<seg id="74">Travel restrictions have been imposed on communities, thus completely eliminating new infections.</seg>
<seg id="75">Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and isolation, CF virus transmission in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not adopted extreme restrictions, such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="76">Singapore cancelled many activities, and on March 28 recommended that residents stay at home, but the school resumed classes on 23 March after the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also controlled the pandemic through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and segregation, and less radical blockades.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistical study found that the lower the case-mortality rate in countries where the number of deaths was detected may be due to the fact that those countries were better able to detect groups with only minor symptoms or no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">WHO recommends that the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first 10 negative COVID-19 samples be sent to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing in countries where there is no testing capacity and where national laboratories have limited experience in handling COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the chart below, "% of positive tests" are influenced by the country's testing policy.</seg>
<seg id="82">In other cases under the same conditions, the positive test rate is higher in countries where only hospitalized persons are tested (whether symptoms or non-existent) than in countries where all citizens are tested.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">Cumulative rates of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) in various countries of the EU/EEA and the UK show similar trends, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly, although at different stages in different countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Italy's experience, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, especially with regard to intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 9 January 2020, the China Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that the pathogen is a new type of coronal virus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">The evidence to date shows that about 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases are minor, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most are rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of the approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed towards serious illness and required hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progressed to critical condition and required intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hospitalized mortality rate for COVID-19 is about 4%.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we have assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in various countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EU Economic Area, EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared it with the Hubei Province of China.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">EU/EEA COVID-19 Cases in countries and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="13">Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those in China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">On 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first COVID-19 cases in Europe based on WHO's case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported from 31 December to 15 March 2019, including in Italy alone, 17,750 and 1,441 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases obtained</seg>
<seg id="19">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country in the world every morning at 8 a.m. only from official sources, such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="20">These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EEA and UK COVID-19, compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculated the 14-day contraction of cumulative morbidity in each EU/EEA country and UK COVID-19 case for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020, as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provided the total number of cumulative cases reported per country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., and compared with Italy's data for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">EU/EEA National and British COVID-19 Trends</seg>
<seg id="24">EU/EEA The trend in COVID-19 cases in the UK and the UK is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, COVID-19's cumulative incidence increased from around 21 February 2020 and then sharply increased around 28 February (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but there is a similar trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (supplementary material).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As of 15 March, at 8:00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is rapidly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed trend in COVID-19 cumulative morbidity rates suggests that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">While countries are at different stages of the national public health response, the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and the options used to select those who must undergo COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including additional tests, vary, but the situation is the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">In early March 2020, approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, according to physicians in affected areas of Italy, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in those areas had reached their maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU/EEA level, the available data are only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases, respectively, in hospital and/or in intensive care wards (data not available).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to complement the current monitoring data on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study carried out in 2010-11 showed that the number of places available for intensive care and medium-term care in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for every 100,000 persons.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-2011 12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people).</seg>
<seg id="37">The ECDC's sixth update to the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled the health-care capacity saturation and associated scenarios, and estimated the relationship between the incidence of patients in the EU/EEA countries and the risk of patients in the UK in the COVID-19 hospital and the number of places in the intensive care beds, and 90 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases have so far been concentrated in some areas of the EU/EEA countries and UK, and hospitals and seriously ill care wards usually provide services for the population in the identified areas, it would be advisable to provide information on cases and critical condition care beds at the level of the Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2 (NUTS-2).</seg>
<seg id="39">The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EEA and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom are developing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards should be prepared to respond to the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of patients in need of medical care, particularly COVID-19, as in affected areas of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, active and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in caseload may not allow decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adjust the response.</seg>
<seg id="42">The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a short window of opportunity that countries may be able to further increase their control in order to reduce the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce pressure on health care systems.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, other EU/EEA health-care systems are likely to face a surge in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Genesis of coronary virus co-production in human animals</seg>
<seg id="2">For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability have contributed to the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts (including humans).</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to 2003, two human coronary viruses (HCoV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreaks of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation, revealing the destructive and deadly nature of HCoV infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 again gave CoV the focus of attention, surprisingly having a high spread but low pathogenicity compared to its sister, SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="6">The HCoV infection is a human and animal co-disease, and it would be helpful to know the origin of HCoV's co-disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most HCoVs come from bats and are non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some HCoV intermediate hosts are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">The identification of animal hosts is directly relevant to the prevention of human disease.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study of the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of human CoV's mechanism of morbidity.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this overview, we provide an overview of seven HCoVs of existing knowledge, highlighting their discovery history, the origin of human and livestock complications and inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is important that we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genome restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this context, we have explored the current epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 2019.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the paper highlights the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of viral evolution on the severity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">CoV belongs to the Coronary Viruses Section and consists of a group of just single chain RNA viruses with membranes.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome in RNA viruses, with 2.6 to 3.2,000 bases, and are called "CoV" due to crown morphology in electron microscopy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, CoV has a non-phase genome sharing similar tissues.</seg>
<seg id="18">About two thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicating enzyme polymer proteins.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polymeric proteins were further processed, resulting in 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1 to 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome contains the ORF of structural proteins, including stabbing (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many spectral heterogene auxiliary proteins are also encoded by coV in different spectral systems.</seg>
<seg id="22">Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genera (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV and δ-CoV), with β-CoV containing the majority of HCoV and subdivided into four spectral systems (A, B, C and D).</seg>
<seg id="23">System developmental evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genes of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, there are 7 species of coronary viruses (HCoV) known to be infected.</seg>
<seg id="26">Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other five β-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively large number of patients, and are more likely to develop into the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and lung exterior.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E viral strain B814 was separated from the nasal secretion of the general influenza patients.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, more human knowledge has been developed through extensive research on two viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which can cause self-contained symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, the notion that HCoV infection was usually harmless before the SARS eruption had been widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 infections and a crude death rate of about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula, spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of a persistent Crown Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which as of 3 March 2020 had claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has been raised and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All seven HCoVs have common animal origins from bats, rats or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Multiple evidence suggests that all HCoV evolutions originate from the bats, where the virus is well adapted and non-pathogenic, but exhibits great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The COVID-19 epidemic posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracking the origins of HCoV's human and animal co-pathy provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of viral species leapfrogging.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, this will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 hosts, intermediate hosts and expanded animal hosts, which will be important in preventing future virus spills.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this overview, we outlined the origin, inter-species transmission and morbidity mechanisms of HCoV's human and animal co-infection.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we highlight and explore a common topic, namely that HCoV's viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural hosts, but are pathogenic when trans-species are transmitted to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we recall the trend towards HCoV evolution, in which the increase in transmitability is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="45">In this context, we also discussed the outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animals CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before HCoV-229E bacterial strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of the general influenza patients, physicians had separated different CoVs in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (table 1) would provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and later adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms of common feelings such as headache, sneeze, maladiness, throat pain, and heat, cough, etc. in 10 to 20% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from organ culture and subsequent sequential transmission of the brain in mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, and there are no significant differences in the symptoms of other respiratory pathogens (e.g. influenza A virus and nose virus).</seg>
<seg id="54">HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, mainly in temperate winter.</seg>
<seg id="55">Typically, the latency of the two viruses is less than a week, and it is about two weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="56">A human volunteer study has shown that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experience moderate common feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a few people with low immune function exhibit severe lower respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by HCoV, whose pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first SARS case dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="60">The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">With the exception of super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in about 2 sequential cases, with a latent period of 4 to 7 days and a high viral vector of 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed signs of muscle pain, headache, heat fever, disharmony and cold war, followed by later symptoms of breathing difficulties, cough and breath distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reduction of lymphocytes, liver function detection abnormalities and increased muscle kinases are common SARS laboratory inspection abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, dispersible pulmonary bubble damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages were observed in SARS patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">About 20–30% of patients subsequently needed intensive care and mechanical gas.</seg>
<seg id="66">In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidneys, may also be infected and usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which may be fatal in patients with low immune functions.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first separated from an open pulmonary viral check-up by a relative of a person of origin travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.</seg>
<seg id="69">HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and immunized patients with respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, nasal, conjunctitis, fever and fine bronchitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study showed that the same virus was separated from the nose specimen of an eight-month-old Dutch boy with pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive throatitis (also known as Grueb throat).</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and fine bronchitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community access to sexual pneumonia and fine bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four communities are well suited to HCoV and are usually less likely to undergo mutations leading to high-pathogenic diseases, but there are also unexpected causes, such as HCoV-NL63, a more toxic rare subtype, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit and survive effectively in the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="81">MERS-CoV was first separated from the lung of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="82">Although the majority of laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional cases of secondary transmission to close contact.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, there was a resurgence of secondary sexual transmission in Korea, with confirmed cases186.</seg>
<seg id="84">The clinical performance of MERS is similar to that of SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which is unique to MERS in HCoV-related diseases to date.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases had been reported, with a high rate of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.</seg>
<seg id="88">In mid-December 2019, patients with concentrated pneumonia were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by retrospective analysis.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a public health event of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is noteworthy that the rate of deaths in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, while the rate outside Hubei is 1.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections in the form of heat, cough and breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="93">Diarrhoea also occurs in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homogeneity of 82% of high nucleotide sequences, they polymerize to different branches in system development trees.</seg>
<seg id="96">SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more infectious.</seg>
<seg id="97">There have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections, which could accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the latency and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four communities acquired HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in the community's acquired HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or asymptomatic behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, albeit at a slightly lower rate.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community acquisition HCoV and SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as transmitable as HCoV in the community.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2s, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, has declined after human transmission and remains to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">At least in some cases, it remains to be clarified whether SARS-CoV-2 excreta-transmission plays an important role as in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal like community access HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, SARS-CoV-2 characteristics such as transmission, pathogenicity and sustained post-transmission will have an important impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All four communities with minor symptoms have acquired HCoV that is well adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both sides may have been survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">HCoV, which causes serious human illnesses, and HCoV, who are suffering from serious illnesses, have died.</seg>
<seg id="115">To this end, HCoV must be adequately replicated in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations against host-limited factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic continues, the greater the number of people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it is well adapted, its spread in humans will be difficult to prevent by isolation or other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, these four communities have acquired the spread of the coronary virus among the population, which has led to common feelings among people with normal immune functions.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses do not require animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="120">In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, are not well adapted to humans and are not able to spread continuously in humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to survive and thrive in human and animal co-infected hosts, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and extended hosts, seeking opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets.</seg>
<seg id="122">SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities that acquire HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as highly contagious as the community acquired HCoV, at least at present.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than HCoV acquired in the community, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="125">It is still to be seen whether it is fully adaptable to humans and circulates within humans without hosts or intermediate animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="126">The definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary hosts, natural hosts, hosts, intermediate hosts and extended hosts are discussed before discussing the origins of HCoV's animals, and are of some guidance to us.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has a closely related ancestor at the level of the nucleotide sequence, the animal will become an evolutionary host of HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="128">The ancestral virus is usually highly adaptable and non-pathogenic in the host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Similarly, the host will carry HCoV on a permanent basis.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">By contrast, if HCoV has just been born in the middle host or immediately to the human body, it will not be able to adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">Such intermediate hosts can serve as a common source of human infection for human animals and can play their role by allowing short replication of the virus and then spreading it to humans to increase the scale of human infection.</seg>
<seg id="133">If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission in the middle host, end-of-life infections may occur.</seg>
<seg id="134">Instead, HCoV can be adapted to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term localities.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural host.</seg>
<seg id="136">An epidemiological retrospective analysis found that SARS indexed cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">Subsequent seropositive surveys showed that the anti-SARS-CoV immunoprotein G (IgG) in animal traders was higher than in the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the living animal market, the fruit beaver (Utricularia) and a beaver cat were first found carrying almost identical SARS-CoV viruses to SARS-CoV viruses.</seg>
<seg id="139">This view is indirectly supported by the fact that there is no further SARS report after the removal of all fruit from the market.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, it was reported that the testing of SARS-CoV by the fruit beaver in the wild or in the inaccessible living animal market was largely negative, suggesting that the fruit beaver might be a natural host with an intermediate amplification rather than SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="141">Notably, since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammals may also act as SARS-CoV intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="142">All these animals appear to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related bats coronary virus known as the SARS-related bird coronary virus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the Chinese bats.</seg>
<seg id="144">These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bat coronary viruses have 88-92% Nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of the bats as hosts of emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, several SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoV) have been identified from bats, but no virus except one designated WIV1 can be separated as a living virus.</seg>
<seg id="148">The human vascular tension conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known SARS-CoV receptor.</seg>
<seg id="149">Experimental evidence suggests that the WIV1 was extracted from bat manure samples using the bats, fruit beaver, and man ACE2 as receptors for entering cells.</seg>
<seg id="150">Interestingly, SARS is the serum of patients during the recovery period and WIV1.</seg>
<seg id="151">To date, WIV1 is the closest ancest to Bat SARS-CoV and has 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although both viruses are highly homogeneous, WIV1 is not considered to be a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and the Bat is not a direct host of SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="153">System development analysis grouped MERS-CoV with the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5 into the same group.</seg>
<seg id="154">Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invade the virus using the same host receptor dipepeptide enzyme 4 (DPP4).</seg>
<seg id="155">MERS-CoV's RNA Dependent RNA polymerase sequence is developed closer to the corresponding RNA in bats β-CoV from Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.</seg>
<seg id="157">MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% Nucleotide sequence homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="158">As a result, the bat may not be the direct host of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that monoplane camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV specificity and antibodies, like camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">The living MERS-CoV, separated from the nose wipe of a single camel, is the same as the virus found in humans, further indicating that the camel is the real host of the MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="161">It should also be noted that in the case of experimental MERS-CoV camels, the general symptoms are minor, but a large number of viruses have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the faeces, which are also the main means by which the bat distributes the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, the problem persists, as many MERS confirmed cases did not have a history of contact with camels prior to their symptoms, which could be attributed to either legendary or unknown means of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="164">The SARS-CoV-2 bats CoV RaTG13 separated from the horseshoe bat have a nucleotide homologue of 96.2%.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine the parent relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is found in the future, the bat may not be the direct host of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="167">It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be sold and slaughtered in wildlife species at the wholesale market in the South China Sea, and that many of the initial COVID-19 cases are associated with them, suggesting that there may have been an animal-to-human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on macrogenomic sequencing have shown that an endangered small mammal known as piercing (Malay piercing) may also carry ancestral β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new candy coronaviruses have 85–92% Nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="170">However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 and are about 90% homologous at nucleotide sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="171">In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sample viral subgeners, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="172">In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more different, although the whole genome is more homogeneous.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on piercing of mountains with disease also reported the detection of viral overlaps from lung samples, with similar results to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="174">The study used different methods of assembly and manual processing and obtained some genomic sequences of about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="175">We cannot rule out the possibility that the piercing of the hill armor is one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="176">However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originates directly from the SMS-CoV-2 due to differences in the β-CoV sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2 piercing.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="178">The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary paths in bats, jancers and other mammals are still to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">Although the highest serial homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and yellow-piercing, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest total genomic sequence homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly probable that the high similarity between the β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the evolution of selectively mediated convergences.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another contrary view is that the β-CoV and RaTG13 associated with SARS-CoV-2 are reorganized in a third species of wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force for evolution, restructuring is widespread in β-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="183">The origins of SARS-CoV-2 direct human and animal co-production have not yet been determined.</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, researchers have studied the origins of common human and animal diseases in HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</seg>
<seg id="185">Systemic developmental evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bats coronary viruses, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">It was reported that the Bat Crown Virus, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American tri-coloured bat, showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another Bat Crown Virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) where camelids are suspected to be hosts.</seg>
<seg id="188">For the sake of clarity, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals.</seg>
<seg id="189">System development analysis provides evidence of historical HCoV intergenerational events.</seg>
<seg id="190">Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was infected with humans from trans-pastoral species, there was a respiratory epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="192">The bat alpha-CoV, which is closely associated with HCoV-229E, has been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="193">Between the two, a camel α-CoV appears.</seg>
<seg id="194">There is a number of evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from the bats to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, rather than camels, may be exposed to bats in common ecological areas.</seg>
<seg id="196">On the contrary, humans are in close contact with lamels.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, the bats α-CoV associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in the bats, while the lamel α-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, no alpha-CoV has been found in wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility of HCoV-229E-related α-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, the bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nippa and Hendra viruses.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it is not surprising that the bat transmits HCoV-229E directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Alternatively, although the bats α-CoV serves as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, sheep camels and monoclamas may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="203">MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the inter-species transmission from the bats to the monoplacids and from monoplacids to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">The origin of the Bats' MERS-CoV evolution is known in their initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforce this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">It is clear that the bats provide a rich reservoir of viral species for inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission of gene fragments.</seg>
<seg id="206">Long-lived and densely populated groups, close social interactions and strong flight capabilities are all favorable conditions for Bat to become the ideal "virus transmitter".</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the monocamel for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It is well adapted to these camels, which have been transformed from intermediate to stable natural hosts.</seg>
<seg id="209">MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains relatively low rates of mutation.</seg>
<seg id="210">It is an accidental sporadic transmission to humans, who remain the terminal hosts of MERS-CoV due to their inability to spread continuously.</seg>
<seg id="211">The role of camels in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (if any) is different from that of camels in MERS-CoV transmission.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in jancers.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be the terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, similar to the fruit beaver in SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="214">In future studies, several possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans must be identified or excluded.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, the bat may be the host of a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share ecological bats through slaughter or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, it may be one of the intermediate enlarged hosts of a new SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating the odour.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">There is a need for antibody surveys of livestock and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reconfigured and adapted in the third species exposed to both bats and through the hill armour.</seg>
<seg id="222">The study of the origins of SARS-CoV-2 animals continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main elements of the virus have played an important role in promoting coronary viruses across inter-species barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, coronary virus mutation rates are estimated to be "medium" to "high", with an average annual replacement rate of about 10–4 times per site 2 based on the coronary virus's adaptation phase to new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="226">Coronavirus has a calibration-reactive nucleic acid ectomy enzyme and its deletion would result in very high variability and decay, or even non-existence.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this nucleic acid trachease and RNA RNA dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Ridsewe is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, coronary virus mutations are about 1 million times higher than those of its hosts.</seg>
<seg id="230">Also, if coronary viruses are not well adapted to hosts, their mutation rate is usually high.</seg>
<seg id="231">SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower rate of mutation than SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host close to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="233">Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.</seg>
<seg id="234">In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause rapid invalidation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the larger RNA genome in coronary viruses has additional plasticity in gene mutation and recombinant modification, thus increasing the possibility of synergistic evolution between species, which, when appropriate, favours the emergence of new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="236">The large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the end of the genome 3' provides evidence for this.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, coronary viruses are randomly and frequently switched templates through unique "replication options" mechanisms during RNA replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">In hosts as mixed containers, chain switching occurs frequently during the CoV RNA transcription.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homogeneous whole and subgenome RNAs can be restructured to produce new coronary viruses.</seg>
<seg id="240">Systemic developmental evidence of natural regrouping has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in bats SL-CoV and Bats CoV-HKU9.</seg>
<seg id="241">Transmission-related viruses - host interactions</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with host receptors is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">This paper uses SARS-CoV reconfiguration as a typical example of evidence of positive selection in inter-sectual incidents.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparative analysis of human and fruit Utricular SARS-CoV separation strains, researchers have suggested that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, particularly through the mutation of S protein RBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">RBDs in coronary viruses S proteins interact with cell receptors and are closely screened by host antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="246">In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 segment, which binds to the human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.</seg>
<seg id="247">RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, fruit beaver, rats and Utricular cats, thus spreading the virus between species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, only six amino acid residues separated from human and fruit Utricular viruses were observed in RBD, four of which were in receptor-binding sequences interacting with ACE2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="249">Fruit Utricular SARS-CoV RBDs have K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the affinity of fibrogen to human ACE2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be essential for the virus's adaptation to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S protein S1 units is 30%, meaning that the binding affinity of S protein and human ACE2 may change.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a study of refrigeration mirrors has shown that the affinity of this union is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptor was needed in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with different parts of S.</seg>
<seg id="256">There are also many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E's amino-peptide enzyme N and HCoV-OC43's 9-O-acetylized saliva acids.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain why the coronary virus has been successfully adapted to humans after spreading across animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCHoV inter-species transmission are also influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">The differences between these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural hosts such as bats, single camels and rodents may constitute an obstacle to inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">HCoV must deprive the host of dependency and break the host's constraint in order to succeed in inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of viral-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.</seg>
<seg id="262">The use of the latest CRISPR technology for an impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restrictive factors is likely to yield results.</seg>
<seg id="263">The emergence of the new HCoV: back to the original point</seg>
<seg id="264">The diversity of bats coronary viruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, Bat-Crown Virus serves as a gene bank for HCoV.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and gene restructuring are also drivers of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes may radically alter the form of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="268">In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans due to the separation of SARS-CoV-related batsviruses, but it has been found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deficiency features of SARS-CoV were found in separate viral strains.</seg>
<seg id="270">This lack divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered adaptive mutations that facilitate host conversion.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-CoV may have been restructured with α- and γ-CoV spectral systems, where a large number of smaller regrouping areas have been found in RNA dependent RNA polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Restructuring sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone a reshuffling of different spectroscopic systems in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganisation events were observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronary viruses were reorganised in their non-structural genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to unexpected changes in the genome of the virus, which may well be due to reduced choice pressures such as the host immune system facing the virus.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these effects is the absence of dual nucleotide in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, resulting in the loss of the entire long ORF4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camelviruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a migration mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is driven by the host selection pressure.</seg>
<seg id="279">After the bats are infected with the coronary virus, no symptoms or only minor symptoms have been detected, indicating that the coronary virus and the bat are adaptable to each other.</seg>
<seg id="280">From anatomical and physiological point of view, the bats seem to be well adapted to the coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, bats for inflammation activated defects that effectively reduce coronary virus-induced pathological changes.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, the natural lethal cell activity of the bats is inhibited by the positive regulation of the inhibited natural lethal cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and by the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility complex I class molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">Furthermore, high-level activated oxygen (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of the bats can both inhibit coronavirus replication and influence calibration through RNA enzymes, thus providing a high pathogenic selection pressure for viral strains into new hosts.</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve by restructuring, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accommodate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="285">As a result, it is not accidental that three new types of HCoV have emerged over the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">Crown viruses do not cause disease or minor symptoms in hosts such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They are copied extensively and do not cause strong host immunizations.</seg>
<seg id="288">That is why there are asymptomatic carriers and serious human infections.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine storms, so that the greater the immune response, the greater the lung damage.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, the immune response has been decoupled from coronary virus replication in asymptomatic carriers.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy of de-linking immune reactions may have an active role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="292">The bats have a particularly strong jamming reaction.</seg>
<seg id="293">It would therefore be useful to use type I jamers at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is also flawed.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory bodies may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="296">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although bats β-CoV with 95% nucleotide congeners have been found with SARS-CoV, there is also a bats coronary virus with SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide congeners up to 96%.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although fruit bever and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">Beta-CoV, which is clearly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, has been found, suggesting that it may be one of the middle hosts, or that beta-CoV may have contributed to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="300">Although still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="301">As a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the coronary virus has been re-focused.</seg>
<seg id="302">The study of coronary viruses in bats and other animals has significantly altered our understanding of the origin of HCoV's co-morbidity and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is abundant evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Given that the SARS-CoV infection resulted from human-fruit-to-bea contact in the marketplace, the closure of the wet cargo market and the killing of the fruit-to-bea could effectively end the SARS epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">Similarly, given the discovery of multiple spectroscopic systems closely related to SARS-CoV-2, beta-CoV, piercing should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent the spread of human and animal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="306">However, the question of whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to humans through armour-piercing and other mammals remains to be further studied.</seg>
<seg id="307">On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in single camels for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are important means of transportation and are the main source of meat, milk, leather and hair products for the local population.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">As a result, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, following the practice of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive initiative should be taken to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.</seg>
<seg id="312">Since we are unable to eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, which could trigger an outbreak of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="313">All types of coronary viruses common to humans and animals are circulating in wild environments.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, there is a high diversity of bats coronary viruses with human and livestock co-infection potential.</seg>
<seg id="315">These human and animal coronary viruses have many opportunities to evolve and reorganize, leading to new coronary viruses that are more easily transmitted and/or fatal in humans in the future.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of consumption of wildlife should be discarded in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the harsh tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their own natural hosts until the spillover opportunities arise.</seg>
<seg id="320">Although the bats have many characteristics conducive to virus transmission, human exposure to the bats and other wild species is greatly reduced if people are educated away from the bats and other wild species.</seg>
<seg id="321">In order to better understand the ecology of coronary viruses and their natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary and will prove very useful in preventing their transmission to humans and future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In general, the most effective way to prevent viral human and animal co-production is for humans to move away from the natural hosts of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="323">SARS-CoV-2 has several missing mysteries about the origins of the disease in humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, it would be useful to examine the circumstances under which the bat and the piercing of the hill armor could share the same ecological bit if the bat spread an old SARS-CoV-2 virus to the piercing hill.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if the bats play a more direct role in human propagation, how human contact with the bats remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third mammal serves as a true intermediate host, it must be made clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and piercing hills.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same progenital viruses will be found in natural hosts in the future if they are bats, piercing mammals or other mammals.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which are important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.</seg>
