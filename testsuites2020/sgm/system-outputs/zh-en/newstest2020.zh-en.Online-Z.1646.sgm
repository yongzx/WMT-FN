<seg id="1">The b ' Covid-19 app is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 Corona Virus Outbreak, helping track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been exposed to infected people ("contacts").</seg>
<seg id="2">Some areas and jurisdiction have developed or proposed many applications with the support of the official government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many of the framework for building close contact tracking apps have been established.</seg>
<seg id="4">Privacy issues are also raising multiple concerns, especially some systems that need to track the geographic location of app users.</seg>
<seg id="5">Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth Signals to record the distance between users and other phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">On December 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that it would integrate this feature that supports Bluetooth app directly into android and ios operating systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In China, the government and paypal have jointly developed an app to support citizens to self-check if they have been exposed to covid-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">The program is currently in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an app called tracetogether.</seg>
<seg id="9">The app, developed by the local it community, was released as an open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app " stopkorona!" to track exposure of potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The app was developed by the north Macedonia ministry of communications technology and the ministry of health.</seg>
<seg id="11">As of December 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from Google play store and Apple app store.</seg>
<seg id="12">On January 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking app has entered an advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch similar apps ("Stopcovid").</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar apps based on Singapore's trace app and bluetrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geographic fence app for covid-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure patients don't leave home.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at University of Cambridge, listed some of the practical problems with the app system, including false positive misreporting, and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population use the app.</seg>
<seg id="15">To stop the spread of misleading or harmful " Corovirus " Apps, Apple has set limits on the type of organization that can publish corovirus-related apps in Apple app store, i.e. only " official " or other well-known organization.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google and Amazon both impose similar restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Privacy Advocates have expressed concern over the use of corona app for mass surveillance, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to respond to the corovirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a limit on this surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="19">These organizations announced eight conditions to be met for government projects:</seg>
<seg id="20">Surveillance must be " Legal, necessary and proportionate</seg>
<seg id="21">Monitoring and surveillance extension must have a "Sunset" clause;</seg>
<seg id="22">Data collected for covid-19 purposes only;</seg>
<seg id="23">Data Security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that it is actually protected;</seg>
<seg id="24">Digital Surveillance must avoid aggravating discrimination and marginalization;</seg>
<seg id="25">Any data sharing with a third party should be defined by law;</seg>
<seg id="26">There must be guarantees against data abuse and citizens the right to respond to data abuse;</seg>
<seg id="27">Calling for all " relevant stakeholders "" effective participation "" including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German chaos computer club (CCC) and reporter ohne grenzen (RSF) also issued a checklist.</seg>
<seg id="28">Google / Apple's proposed plan aims to address ongoing monitoring issues and remove it from device operating systems once tracking is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some countries have adopted location tracking based on web rather than apps, where users don't need to download the app while avoiding being tracked.</seg>
<seg id="30">Web-based tracking has been approved in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="31">Web solutions with access to original location data could have serious privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use central servers to communicate with each other are now created (see below).</seg>
<seg id="33">South Korea has launched an app-based system to perform contact tracking tasks.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instead of using dedicated apps, the system opts to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices tracking data and credit card transaction data, then combines that information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.</seg>
<seg id="35">In addition to using these information to remind potential close contacts, the government has also been allowed to disclose location information as the country made major changes to the information privacy act following the outbreak of mers outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="36">This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Other countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of December 6, 2020, the details have not been announced.</seg>
<seg id="38">Privacy Protection Close contact tracking is an accepted concept, with a large number of related research literature dating back to at least 2013 as of December 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy protection solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (ble) to record the distance between users and other phones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pepp-PT is a coordination program that includes centralized and distributed approaches, not a single agreement. The dispersion protocol includes dispersed privacy protection neighborhood tracking (DP-PPT), temporary contact numbers (Tcn, formerly known as contact event number, Cen), privacy sensitive agreements and mobile contact tracking mechanism (PACT).</seg>
<seg id="40">Under these agreements, identifiable personal data never leaves the device and all matches are done on the device.</seg>
<seg id="41">The privacy team at mit media lab has been developing safepaths platform that uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or path crossover data to track covid-19</seg>
<seg id="42">The platform is based on research on the white paper on app rogue: maintaining personal privacy in outbreak, published in December 2020 in addition to that, ENIGMA MPC, a company, originally founded in mit media lab and dedicated to developing privacy technology, is developing a similar platform called safetrace.</seg>
<seg id="43">Safetrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">On December 5, 2020, some groups joined together the global tcn alliance around basically the same approach and basic overlapping agreements with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting the global mutual of tracking and alert applications operability, which is a key to achieving a wide range of applications.</seg>
<seg id="45">On December 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government app is using the open source bluetrace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="46">Google and Apple, which controls android and Ios mobile platforms respectively announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming Bluetooth Low Power Technology with privacy protection combining technology can protect privacy.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition, they released core technical norms used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="48">Apple and google say the system plans to launch in three stages:</seg>
<seg id="49">Introducing tools to support the government in creating an official corona tracking app that protect privacy</seg>
<seg id="50">Integrating this feature directly into ios and android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through an operating system update, which will be removed in the same way after the epidemic threat to address the follow-up monitoring problem.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hand washing, also known as hand cleansing, is the act of cleaning your hands to clear the dust, Grease, microbes or other useless material.</seg>
<seg id="2">Persistence on washing hands with soap at some " critical moments of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through dung-mouth.</seg>
<seg id="3">If people don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membrane), they can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Five Key moments of the day to wash your hands with soap: before and after urination, cleaning the child's hips or after changing diapers, before feeding, before and before and after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is no soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health organization recommends washing hands in:</seg>
<seg id="6">Before, during and after preparing food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before and after taking care of patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">After changing diaper or cleaning the toilets kid's hips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wipe your nose, cough or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="10">After touching animals, animal food or animal poop.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medical staff hand hygiene refers to sanitary habits associated with medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Washing your hands before prescription or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the medical field of medical care, the main objective of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microbiome that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause disease.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hand washing is especially important for people working in food processing or working in the medical field, but washing is also very important for the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, corovirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;</seg>
<seg id="16">And reducing infant mortality at home delivery.</seg>
<seg id="17">A study in 2013 showed that improving hand washing habits could contribute slightly to the height of children under five years old.</seg>
<seg id="18">In developing countries, child mortality related to respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by advocating for simple behavioural change (such as washing hands with soap).</seg>
<seg id="19">This simple act could reduce the death rate of these diseases by nearly 50 %.</seg>
<seg id="20">Advocating for hand washing could reduce about one third of diarrhoea cases, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hand washing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48 % as a spontaneous act in families, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and acute respiratory infections (acute response infections, Ari) cheapest way.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death of children under five years of age, which kills about 1800 million children every year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3500 million children dead each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">UNICEF says turning hands with soap before meal and after toilets can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, halve deaths caused by diarrhoea by nearly half the resulting deaths were reduced by a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="25">As part of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) project, other hygiene interventions are usually accompanied by advocating for hand washing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hand washing can also prevent pustules transmitted through direct physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hand washing can have a minor negative effect that frequent hand washing can cause dry skin and cause skin damage.</seg>
<seg id="28">A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing leads to itchy, chaps, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">Excessive frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of OCD.</seg>
<seg id="30">Five Key moments in order to reduce disease's dung-mouth spread, make sure to wash your hands with soap in the day: after washing (Urination, urination) after cleaning the child's hips (changing diapers), before meal and after handling food before and after raw meat, fish or raw poultry.</seg>
<seg id="31">To prevent the spread of disease, washing your hands should also be used in the right way: dealing with cutting or after a cut or after sneezing, cough or wiping nose; after touching animal poop or treating animals; and after touching garbage.</seg>
<seg id="32">In many countries / regions, the rate of washing hands with soap is low.</seg>
<seg id="33">A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 % of households use soap-washing habits. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of 97 percent, with the United States approaching the average, i.e. 77 percent, and China's lowest rate of 23 %. Now, multiple behavioural change methods are being implemented to advocate for washing hands with soap at critical moments. In order to develop a hand washing habit for children, developing countries have the option of having children in school to wash their hands every day.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Basic Health care program introduced by the Philippine Department of education is an example of a massive initiative to improve children's health and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the heart of the national plan is deworm twice a year, accompanied by washing hands with soap and brushing teeth with Fluoride-containing toothpaste.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Indonesia, the plan has also been successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="37">Blending with soap or cleaner in water can better remove microbes from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main function of soap and cleaners is to reduce dissolve obstacles and improve solubility.</seg>
<seg id="39">Using water alone doesn't effectively clean skin because fat and protein (part of organic soil) are not easily dissolve in water.</seg>
<seg id="40">But cleaning hands requires reasonable use of water......</seg>
<seg id="41">Solid Soap, as it can be reused, may preserve bacteria left behind when it was used before.</seg>
<seg id="42">A small amount of studies surveyed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because bacteria can be washed away by foam.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the CDC still claims "the best choice of non-contact liquid soap".</seg>
<seg id="44">Antibacterial Soap has been widely promoted among the health conscious public.</seg>
<seg id="45">So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistant microbes in nature has been chosen using recommended antibacterial or disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorosa, which has a large number of drug resistant microbiotics.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, even if antibacterial soap is not chosen for antibiotic resistant strains, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="48">In addition to surfactants and skincare agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (Acetate, anti-bad blood acid, Lactic Acid), antibacterial active benzoic acid, and more skin conditioners (Aloe Vera, vitamins, Peppermint, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the university of public health at the university of Oregon shows that ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing trichlorosa in preventing disease and clearing bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="49">Hot water washing your hands is comfortable, but its heat isn't enough to kill bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bacteria breed quickly at body temperature (37Â°C).</seg>
<seg id="51">However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural grease containing soil and bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="52">Scientific research has confirmed that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbiome on hand, contrary to the common view.</seg>
<seg id="53">Water-free hand wash or sterilized hand wash is a non-Water Base Hand Cleanser.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the late s and early s, non-Water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol rubbing liquid, free hand wash-free hand wash or hand wash) was popular.</seg>
<seg id="55">Most of this type of hand washing detergent contains isopropyll or ethanol, then add thickers such as kapom (acrylic polymer) to form gel, or add moisturizing agents such as glycerine to form Liquid, or foam so easy use and relieve dry skin caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="56">Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide could further increase antibacterial activity. Free hand wash that contains at least 60 to 95 % alcohol can effectively sterilize.</seg>
<seg id="57">Alcohol rubbing hand fluid can kill bacteria, Multi-Drug-resistant bacteria (Methylin Staphylococcus (MRSA) and anti-vancomycin enteria), TB and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syndrome) viruses (RSV), nasal virus, acne, flu and hepatitis) and fungus.</seg>
<seg id="58">After 70 % alcohol rubbing liquid used for 30 seconds, it can kill 99.97 % of bacteria in your hand (reduced by 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 DB), rubbing hands bacteria can be reduced by 99.99 % to 99.999 % (4 TO 5 orders of magnitude) in your hands in 1 minutes. Free hand washing detergent is the most effective for bacteria, while for some viruses it works slightly less.</seg>
<seg id="59">Alcohol rubbing hand fluid has almost no effect on virus (Norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It must be used enough non-sterilized hand washing detergent or alcohol to completely moist or cover both hands.</seg>
<seg id="60">Scrub the palm and back of your hand, as well as between fingers and all fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel dried.</seg>
<seg id="61">Fingertips must also be fully cleaned, scrub the fingertips on both palms. The CDC suggests it's best to wash your hands than using free hand rub, especially when it looks dirty.</seg>
<seg id="62">Since such hand rubbing fluids are easy to use and can quickly inactive microbiome, they are increasingly being used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water available.</seg>
<seg id="63">Frequent use of alcohol free hand washing can cause dry skin unless a moisturizer and / or moisturizer is added to the formula.</seg>
<seg id="64">Glycerin and / or other skin moisturizer can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate dryness caused by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="65">In Clinical Trials, alcohol free hand washing with Skin Moisturizer can significantly reduce skin irritation and dryness than soap or antibacterial cleanser.</seg>
<seg id="66">Allergic exposure to skin inflammation, contact hives syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol rubbing liquid is rare.</seg>
<seg id="67">One reason why alcohol free hand washing is less likely to induce stimulating sexual contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Water Cleaner, while effective, does not remove organic matter from hand, just sterilize it.</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, free hand washing fluid is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as soap and water, as these pathogens are still in hand.</seg>
<seg id="70">The effectiveness of non-alcohol free hand washing determines depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, which has historically been much worse than alcohol and alcohol rubbing.</seg>
<seg id="71">Recently, formulations using benzaza ammonium chloride has been proven to have sustained, cumulative anti-bacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been confirmed to be reduced after reuse, possibly due to gradual cause bad skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="72">Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.</seg>
<seg id="73">Grass Gray or soil is better than washing hands alone, but not as soap.</seg>
<seg id="74">One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated with microbiome, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slowing it.</seg>
<seg id="75">Like Soap, grass ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it meets water.</seg>
<seg id="76">Who suggests that if there is no soap available, you can replace soap with grass ash or sand.</seg>
<seg id="77">The CDC suggests the right hand washing steps to prevent the spread of disease:</seg>
<seg id="78">Wet your hands with flowing warm water or cold water.</seg>
<seg id="79">Running water is recommended because vertical basins may be contaminated, and the water temperature doesn't seem to matter much.</seg>
<seg id="80">Scrub repeatedly with enough soap to produce foam while cleaning the back, fingers and nails.</seg>
<seg id="81">Soap removes bacteria from the skin, research shows that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than water alone.</seg>
<seg id="82">Scrub at least 20 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="83">Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, the longer you scrub, the more bacteria remove.</seg>
<seg id="84">Wash fully with flowing water.</seg>
<seg id="85">Washing hands with a water basin can cause recontamination.</seg>
<seg id="86">Dry or dry naturally with clean towels.</seg>
<seg id="87">Moist hands are easier to be recontaminated. Thumbs, wrist, fingers and nail seams are the most frequently overlooked parts.</seg>
<seg id="88">Artificial Nails and cracked nail polish may hide microbes.</seg>
<seg id="89">Moisturizing Lotion is usually recommended to avoid hand drying; dry skin can cause skin damage, thus increasing the risk of infection transmission.</seg>
<seg id="90">Where tap water and / or soap is not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, such as pourd water through a hanging barrel or pourd, and / or using grass Ash (if necessary)). Water-saving hand washing programs, such as easy taps and other low-cost ways can be used when water supply is limited water supply (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries).</seg>
<seg id="91">The technique of easy faucet is simple, hang a water tank with rope, then pouring a small amount of water to your hand through a pedal, then using soap.</seg>
<seg id="92">Wiping your hands effectively is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there's still some controversy about the most effective way to dry hands in public bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="93">More and more research shows that tissues are healthier than electric dry phones offered by many toilets.</seg>
<seg id="94">In 2008, Westminster University of London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, on paper towels, warm-style dry phones and more modern jet dry phones comparisons in terms of hygiene.</seg>
<seg id="95">After washing your hands with warm wind drying your hands, the total amount of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 194 % and the total amount of bacteria on the pal</seg>
<seg id="96">And with jet dry mobile phone, the total amount of bacteria on fingers increased by an average of 42 % and the total bacteria on the palm</seg>
<seg id="97">Wipe your hands after washing tissues, the total amount of bacteria on fingers declined by an average of 76 percent, and the total amount of palm bacteria decrease of 77 percent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hands may cause bathroom users and toilet facilities have cross infection.</seg>
<seg id="98">Jet dry phones allegedly spray air at 180 meters / s (650 mph; 400 mph; 400 mph), capable of blowing away microbes on hand and on the plane, thus potentially contaminating 2 other bathroom users and toilet facilities within meters.</seg>
<seg id="99">Using warm wind dry phones to spread microbes 0.25 meters away from dry phones.</seg>
<seg id="100">Results from using tissue dry hands suggest there is no serious microbiome spread. In 2005, tÃ¼v produckt und umwelt conducted a study that assesses different ways of dry hands.</seg>
<seg id="101">The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after dry hands:</seg>
<seg id="102">The study involves many different dry phone manufacturers, comparing these dry phones with paper towels.</seg>
<seg id="103">During Travel, you can choose to wash your hands with hand sterilized wet towels without soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="104">Alcohol free hand washing detergent should be at least 60 %.</seg>
<seg id="105">Hungarian doctor ignaz semmelweis discovered in 1846 that washing could effectively prevent the spread of diseases in hospitals, however, it was forced to require medical staff to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="106">Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="107">A study found a decrease in infection rates after using these devices.</seg>
<seg id="108">Medical staff wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel to generate foam and scrub all parts of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="109">Hands and fingers are rubbing each other.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there is residue between the nail seams, you can be cleared with a hard brush.</seg>
<seg id="111">Since the remaining moisture on hand may still have bacteria, it is necessary to be fully cleaned and clean towels.</seg>
<seg id="112">After wiping, tissue should be used to close the taps (use tissue to open the exit door if necessary).</seg>
<seg id="113">This prevents hand from contamination with these surfaces again.</seg>
<seg id="114">At Medical and health facilities, hand washing aims to Eliminate Pathogen Microbiome ("bacteria") and avoid spreading.</seg>
<seg id="115">Reports from the new England medical journal show that in most medical environments, there are still not reaching an acceptable level of hand washing, with a large number of healthcare workers often forget to wash their hands before they contact with patients, leading to the spread of microbes.</seg>
<seg id="116">A study suggests that proper hand washing, along with other simple procedures, can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health organization has released a worksheet that gives standard hand washing and rubbing methods in medical institutions demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="117">The organization also published draft hand hygiene guidelines on its website for public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="118">Whitby and others made a review.</seg>
<seg id="119">If compliance is needed to be confirmed, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by rival health.</seg>
<seg id="120">The "five moments" recommended by the world health organization to wash hands:</seg>
<seg id="121">After contact with blood / body</seg>
<seg id="122">Before Sterile Operation</seg>
<seg id="123">After taking care of the patient. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (" Soap " or " Antibacterial Soap ") can make hand washing agents sterilize.</seg>
<seg id="124">This sterilization may be required before surgery or in environments with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microbiotics. When "Scrub" hands for surgery, there must be a faucet that can be opened and closed without contact, chlorohexine or iodine, Sterile Towels used to wipe your hands after washing hands, Sterile Brush and cleaning other aseptic tools for nails seams.</seg>
<seg id="125">All Jewelry must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="126">This procedure requires washing hands, forearm to elbow, usually wash 2 TO 6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="127">No long scrub (10 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="128">When washing, you must prevent water on your forearm from returning to your hands.</seg>
<seg id="129">After washing your hands, use sterile cloth to dry your hands and put on surgery clothes.</seg>
<seg id="130">In order to reduce bacteria spread, it is better to wash your hands before and after contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="131">To control Staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it is found that the greatest benefits of cleaning your hands come from washing frequency of 20 percent, and the further benefits are extremely limited when the frequency of cleaning up to more than 35</seg>
<seg id="132">Washing your hands with ordinary soap can lead to more than tripled the rate of bacterial infectious diseases spread to food compared to antibacterial soap. After comparing the use of alcohol rubbing your hands with antibacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), it was found that bacterial infections using alcohol rubbing liquid is 26 % lower than antibacterial soap.</seg>
<seg id="133">However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol rubbing hand in reducing the H1n1 Influenza A (Hi1n1 Influenza A) virus and clostridium differential spores. Hand hygiene in medical facilities can be improved by training staff on how to wash their hands, increase the supply of alcohol rubbing fluid and giving written and oral reminders to employees.</seg>
<seg id="134">Further research is needed on which intervention is most effective in various medical settings.</seg>
<seg id="135">In developing countries, washing your hands with soap is considered an important tool for cost-effective physical health and even good nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="136">However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, schools and workplace makes universal hand washing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="137">For example, in most african rural areas, it is rare to have hand washing faucet near every private bathroom or public bathroom, even with cheap methods to build a hand washing table.</seg>
<seg id="138">However, the low frequency of hand washing can also be caused by deep-rooted habits, not by a lack of soap or water.</seg>
<seg id="139">Promoting and advocating for hand washing with soap can affect policy making, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioural changes among residents.</seg>
<seg id="140">To Be effective, monitoring and evaluation must be done.</seg>
<seg id="141">A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing the proportion of hand washing in low-income countries (Lmics), while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of advocating for hand washing in schools is the "Samsung approach" introduced by UNICEF, among other hygiene requirements, encouraging schools to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.</seg>
<seg id="142">When minimum standards are reached, schools can rise from one star to top three stars.</seg>
<seg id="143">Hand washing promotion could include building hand washing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.</seg>
<seg id="144">Another example of hand washing activity is world hand washing day, which aims to try to achieve behavioural change. UNICEF has promoted the use of a hand washing emoji due to the 2019-20 Corona virus epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="145">Few studies have looked at the relationship between the overall cost-benefits of hand washing and the avoidance of disability adjustment life (Daly) in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="146">However, reports suggest that advocating for hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation intervention.</seg>
<seg id="147">The earliest to recognize the importance of hand washing for human health -- especially for those with weak bodies (such as newly born mothers in hospitals or wounded soldiers) were two hand hygiene in the mid-19th century pioneers in the field: Ignaz Semmelweis, a hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence, founder of modern nursing " Florence Nightingale).</seg>
<seg id="148">At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the stinky smell known as the poison.</seg>
<seg id="149">Outbreaks of foodborne diseases and pathogenic infections in the s prompted the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention to advocate for hand hygiene, highlighting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.</seg>
<seg id="150">The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the covid-19 epidemic in 2020 have increased awareness among many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="151">Germany, for example, "the right way to wash" posters will hang next to hand washing pools in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets.</seg>
<seg id="152">The Idiom "washing hands off" means that someone declares that he is not willing to be responsible for something or unwilling to participate in something.</seg>
<seg id="153">It stems from the Bible Matthew, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after the decision to nail Jesus and later evolved into widespread idioms in some English-speaking groups.</seg>
<seg id="154">In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth began forced washing her hands for trying to clean imaginary stains, showing her guilt for the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to commit.</seg>
<seg id="155">Research shows that people who think or contemplate immoral behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others and often cherish hand washing facilities more.</seg>
<seg id="156">Moreover, those who can wash their hands after envisioning immoral behavior are unlikely to engage in other "purifying" compensatory actions such as volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="157">Religion calls for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic washing hands with water but without soap is part of many religious iconic hand washing, including Baha ' I faith, Hindu, Judaism and netilat yadayim puristianity gifts and little purity in Islam. Religion also has hand-washing regulations for hygiene, especially after certain behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="158">Hindu, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after toilet.</seg>
<seg id="159">Hindu, Buddhism, Sikh, Judaism and Islam require hand wash before and after meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The outbreak of 2019 Covid-2 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Cov-2 has so far infected 80,000 in China and other parts of the world. Many people, killing more than 3,000 people, causing huge human disaster.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar to homogeneous virus SARS-Cov, which caused thousands of people infected sars in 2003, SARS-Cov-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Covid-19 is lower in gravity and mortality than sars, it is more spread, with more elderly people than young and more males than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the rapid increase in new crown pneumonia-related publications, this article would like to give a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly growing research topic.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will introduce basic knowledge about epidemiology, etiology, viral, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this synthesis will help understand and eradicate this horrific disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Spring Festival on December 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and memorable memory of the Chinese people, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to stay out of their homes throughout the holidays and weeks.</seg>
<seg id="8">The virus is highly homogenic with the cov that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the world health organization (who) will put it on December 11, 2020 named SARS-Cov-2, the related disease is known as corovirus disease-19 (Covid-19).</seg>
<seg id="9">The epidemic began in wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of December 2, 2020, the virus has led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of covid-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 dead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Who warned that covid-19 has become the " no. 19 public enemy and its threat may surpass terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to pubmed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), there are less than two months since the first reported isolation of virus sequences from multiple patients on January 7, 2020 several papers on covid-19 have been published on virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">This article aims to summarize research progress in this emerging subject area.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is used to compare Covid-19 to sars and another cov-induced disease, Middle East Breathing Syndrome (Mers, outbreak in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">We will also discuss what has been learned so far on prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some urgent issues that remain to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cov used to be a non-Lethal pathogen in humans, causing about 15 % of common cold 4.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human cov, SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, spreading quickly many other countries have terrible prevalence and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore, the covid-19 outbreak is the third cov outbreak recorded in human history.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shown in figure 1,1, wuhan city first reported several unknown cases of pneumonia to the Chinese National Health Council on December 31, 2019</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven days later, the cov sequence was released.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wuhan reported its first death case on December 15, 2020</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the epidemic is rapidly spreading to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">Infections were reported on December 20, suggesting that there may be a human-to-person phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="24">Wuhan City closed the city and closed all public transport on December 23</seg>
<seg id="25">The first clinical study on new crown pneumonia on December 24, only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the South China seafood market in wuhan, which is believed to be the starting point of infection from unknown animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 30, who declared the outbreak a "Global Health emergency".</seg>
<seg id="27">By the time of release of this report, the disease has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe (Figure 2 (Fig). 2)).</seg>
<seg id="28">Due to the rapid growth of the epidemic, the ultimate scope and extent of the outbreak have yet to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Multi-centric study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed covid-19 patients) provided an updated explanation of the epidemic as follows shown (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).</seg>
<seg id="30">Sars-Cov-2 can infect all ages, but the main age group is 30-65</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost half (47.7 %) of those infected are over 50 years old, very few under 20 and only 14 infected are under 10</seg>
<seg id="32">Sars-Cov-2 infected more males (0.31/10 million) than women (0.27/10 million).</seg>
<seg id="33">Covid-19 mainly gathered for sexual transmission in and around hubei.</seg>
<seg id="34">Covid-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from illness to diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="35">The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.</seg>
<seg id="36">The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Basic Regeneration Number (R0) is 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted r0 is 2.23-4.82.</seg>
<seg id="38">The number of infected people has increased exponentially by January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass migration in China before the Chinese new year.</seg>
<seg id="39">The death rate of diagnosed cases is 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).</seg>
<seg id="40">The three major risk factors for covid-19 are gender (male), age (+ 60 years) and severe pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="41">Cov is a large mask virus subfamily containing single justice chain RNA.</seg>
<seg id="42">They can be divided into four genus, i.e. a, beta, Gamma and Delta, where Alpha-Cov and beta-Cov are known to be infected with humans.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sars-Cov and mers-Cov-Cov combined with cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ace2) and Dipeptide Enzyme 4 (dpp4) and then membrane fusion pm</seg>
<seg id="44">The viral rna genome is released into cytoplasm; after the viral genome is copied, genomic rna together with mask protein, together with encapsule protein and nuclear coat protein, then fusion with the mass membrane and release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The first genome sequence of SARS-Cov-2 was reported on January 10, 2020</seg>
<seg id="46">It was found that SARS-Cov-2 is a new type of beta-Cov, with genetic consistency over 99.98 % of 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China seafood market in wuhan city, the original outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sars-Cov-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-Cov than mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="48">Sars-Cov-2 particles have been discovered in ultra-thin slices of the popultra thin slices of the popultra.</seg>
<seg id="49">Research found that human ace2 is the recipient of SARS-Cov-2 AND SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, SARS-Cov-2 has a weak bond between SARS-Cov-2 s protein and human ace2 compared to the fact that SARS-Cov-2 IS LESS SEVERE THAN SARS-Cov matching.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sars-Cov-2 can also form new short protein coded by orf3b and secretion protein coded by orf8</seg>
<seg id="52">The Orf3b OF SARS-Cov-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of ifn beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or base sequences.</seg>
<seg id="53">On December 2, 2020, Zhou et al. Reported the structure of frozen electron microscopy (Cryo-em), which forms complex with amino acid transporter protein b0at1 with a resolution of 2.9 Ã¥s.</seg>
<seg id="54">They found that the complex has open and closed conformations, assembled into a dimer, and the ace2-B0at1 Complex can combine two s proteins, thus providing evidence of cov recognition and infection.</seg>
<seg id="55">B0at1 could be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress Sars-Cov-2 infections.</seg>
<seg id="56">Origin and middle host</seg>
<seg id="57">It is known that SARS-Cov and mers-Cov both originated from bat and spread to humans through beaver and camels, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="58">Bat is believed to be the natural host of SARS-Cov-Cov-2 by comparison with other cov-2 BECAUSE THE NEW VIRUS IS COMPARING TWO SARS-like cov from the bat --. 96 % consistency for bat-SL-Covzx45 And Bat-SL-Covzx21 --</seg>
<seg id="59">However, it is unclear what intermediate host helps the virus cross species barriers to infect humans, and its pathways of transmission also remains to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="60">Ji et al. Suggest snakes are carriers from bat to humans, which involves homologous recombinations within s protein.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe a cov found in pangzhou, a kind of long-kissed anteater, often used in Chinese medicine -- has 99 % of Cov-2 -- Gene Homology, therefore, is considered the potential intermediate host of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="62">However, the 1 % difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence is yet to provide decisive results (Fig). 33).</seg>
<seg id="63">The physical and chemical nature of SARS-Cov-2 remains largely unclear.</seg>
<seg id="64">Sars-Cov and mers-Cov can survive in dry environments for 48 hours, with up to 5 days at 20Â°C and 40 % humidity.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sars-Cov-2 may have a similar nature.</seg>
<seg id="66">Sars-Cov-2 is reportedly sensitive to UV and thermal sensitivity -- 56Â°C 30 minutes; Ether, 75 % ethanol, Chlorine Disinfectant, peroethanic acid, chloroform and other fat solvent all can effectively inactive virus, but chlorine is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="67">Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-Cov-2, and therefore are susceptible to the new virus.</seg>
<seg id="68">Currently, there are no detailed study of the immune response to SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="69">Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other cov, especially sars-Cov and mers-Cov (Fig). 4). 4</seg>
<seg id="70">Generally speaking, the virus is first recognized by the host's inherent immune system (PRR), including type c-like receptor, toll-like receptor (TLR), nod-like receptor (NLR)) and rig-I-like receptor (RLR.</seg>
<seg id="71">Viruses Induce inflammatory factors expressed through different pathways, dentic cells maturity and synthesis of type I interferon (Ifn), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the giant phage of the virus antigen.</seg>
<seg id="72">But Sars-Cov's n protein can help the virus get rid of immune responses.</seg>
<seg id="73">Adaptive immune responses will soon join the fight against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="74">T LYMPHOCYTES including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells play an important role in antivirus defense.</seg>
<seg id="75">Cd4+ T cells stimulate b cells to produce viral specific antibodies, while cd8+ t cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.</seg>
<seg id="76">Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help these defensive cells.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, cov can inhibit t cell function by inducing t cell apoptosis.</seg>
<seg id="78">Body Fluid immune including supplements such as c3a and c5a - and antibodies are also essential to fighting viral infections.</seg>
<seg id="79">For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can neutralize mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="80">On the other hand, excessive reaction of the immune system can produce large quantities of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, in the worst case, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.</seg>
<seg id="81">Sars-Cov-2 infection, characterized by aggregate morbidity, are more likely to affect older people with multiple syndrome as well as pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="82">Often, individuals exposed to large numbers of viruses or impaired immune function are more likely to be infected than others.</seg>
<seg id="83">According to a study of the first 425 cases in wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-Cov-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days.</seg>
<seg id="84">However, a study of 1,099 cases shows an average incubation period of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.</seg>
<seg id="85">As previously mentioned, a recent study shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, according to the demographics of 8,866 cases.</seg>
<seg id="86">For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective segregation time based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent symptomatic infections from spreading the virus to others.</seg>
<seg id="87">As usual, viral contacts or infected people usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="88">Should the isolation be extended to 24 days?</seg>
<seg id="89">Fever is usually the main and first symptoms of covid-19, which can be without any other symptoms, but can also be accompanied by dry cough, gas promotion, dizziness, dizziness, headache, headache, flux, chest pain, diarrhoea, nau waiting for symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some patients suffered from breathing difficulties and / or hypoxia one week after illness.</seg>
<seg id="91">Serious people will quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acids and blood coagulation dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="92">Even without lung imaging anomaly, patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for early diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="93">A demographic study conducted late January 2019 shows the percentage of various symptoms: fever, dry cough 76 %, breathing difficulties 55 % and diarrhoea 3 %; 8 % of patients need ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="94">Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on family gatherhood and asymptomatic individual transmission.</seg>
<seg id="95">By contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that mers-Cov patients also dominated fever (98 %), dry cough (47 %) and breathing difficulties (55 %).</seg>
<seg id="96">However, 80 % of those patients need ventilation support, much more than covid-19 patients, coinciding with mers fatality higher than covid-19</seg>
<seg id="97">Diarrhea (26 %) and pharyngeal pain (21 %) were also observed in mers patients.</seg>
<seg id="98">Among Sars patients, fever (99 %- 100 %), dry cough (29 %- 75 %), difficulty breathing (40 %- 42 %), diarrhea (20-25 %) %) and pharyngeal pain (13 % (25 %) are the main symptoms, with about 14 to 20 % of patients need ventilation support.</seg>
<seg id="99">As of January 14, 2 CONFIRMED COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 66,576, with a death rate of 2 %.</seg>
<seg id="100">In contrast, sars had a mortality rate of 10 % in 8,096 confirmed cases as of January 2002</seg>
<seg id="101">For Mers, according to a demographic study conducted in December 2012, the death rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 %.</seg>
<seg id="102">An early study reported that SARS-Cov-2 R0 is up to 6.47,95 % confidence interval (CI), while SARS-Cov's R0 IS ONLY 2 to 4.</seg>
<seg id="103">Table 1.1 shows SARS-Cov-2 comparison with mers-Cov and Sara-Cov in terms of symptoms, mortality and r0</seg>
<seg id="104">THE ABOVE DATA SHOWS THAT SARS-Cov-2 diffuse capability is higher than mers-COV AND SARS-Cov, but is less deadly than the latter.</seg>
<seg id="105">Therefore, controlling the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic is more challenging than mers-COV AND SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="106">Aggregate diseases typically occur in the same family, or from the same gathering or transport, such as cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="107">Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in wuhan or other outbreak areas in the last two weeks before the disease, or have a history of close contact with infected person or patients.</seg>
<seg id="108">However, people are reportedly able to carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients discharged can carry the virus again, thus warnings of extending the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="109">The number of blood white cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients early in the early stages of disease is normal or decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="110">For example, leukocyte count 4 Ã 109 / L -- including lymphocyte count 1 Ã 109 / L -- was found in 1,099 patients disease, higher levels of amino transfer enzyme and viral blood.</seg>
<seg id="111">Higher Levels of liver enzyme and muscle enzymes in the blood were seen in the blood, and most patients saw high blood c-reaction protein and blood sinking.</seg>
<seg id="112">Blood fibrin degradation product d-Dimer levels and lymphocyte count is seen in heavy patients.</seg>
<seg id="113">Most Covid-19 patients can see abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by bilateral spots shadows or lung grinding glass shadow.</seg>
<seg id="114">Patients usually suffer from atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards).</seg>
<seg id="115">Uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and sexual fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange when ards occur.</seg>
<seg id="116">Type I and type ii epithelial cell dysfunction can reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thus reducing lung expansion capacity and increase the risk of lung collapse.</seg>
<seg id="117">Therefore, the worst chest imaging discoveries often coincide with the disease's worst.</seg>
<seg id="118">Covid-18 first pathological analysis of covid-19 found alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, and mesive lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nuclear cell cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathology of ards, and similar to sars and mers patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">The detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA through reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing covid-19</seg>
<seg id="120">However, since a higher false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began using clinical manifestations for diagnosis (instead of relying solely on RT-PCR) on January 13</seg>
<seg id="121">A similar situation happened when diagnosed sars.</seg>
<seg id="122">Therefore, combining medical history, clinical performance, lab tests and imaging results is crucial for effective diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="123">On December 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a program to detect Sars-Cov-2 using crispr-based Sherlock technology, which does not require complicated instruments, using a test paper synthetic Sars-Cov detected in less than an hour with concentrations of 20 Ã 10-18 mol / l to 200 Mol / L (10-100 copies per microlitre)-2 RNA fragments.</seg>
<seg id="124">If proven in clinical samples, this new technique is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="125">Due to lack of experience in treating new cov, doctors mainly support treatment for covid-19 patients while trying to be used or proposed for other cov - such as SARS-Cov and mers-Cov - and other viral diseases various treatments (Table (table2). 2).</seg>
<seg id="126">These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antivirus, immunoinhibitors, steroids, blood plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is even recommended that the blood plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="128">Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.</seg>
<seg id="129">Sars-Cov-2 mainly attacked the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs that express ace2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="130">Nevertheless, breathing dysfunction and failure are major threats to patients and major causes of death.</seg>
<seg id="131">Therefore, breathing support is crucial to relieving symptoms and saving lives, including regular oxygen inhalation, high flow oxygen inhalation, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation, depending on the extent of</seg>
<seg id="132">Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive support from external membrane oxygen synthesis (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="133">In addition, Maintaining Electrolyte Balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and sepseptic shock and protecting critical organ functions are essential for SARS-Cov-2 patients.</seg>
<seg id="134">It is known that overreaction of the immune system in sars and mers patients leads to cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="135">Cytokine storms are a form of full body inflammation, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including tnf a, IL-1 Beta, IL-2, IL-6, ifn a, ifn beta, IFN GAMMA AND MCP-1.</seg>
<seg id="136">These cytokines can induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, a major cause of ards and multiple organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="137">Immunosuppressive is crucial in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe illness.</seg>
<seg id="138">Cortical steroids and tobeads single-an anti-Il6 Monoclonal Antibody - have been used to treat cytokine storms.</seg>
<seg id="139">Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include: regulating t cell directional immune responses; blocking ifn-Gamma, IL-1 and tnf; inhibiting jak; bonatomitting; Cytokine Signal Transfer Inhibitor 4; and hdac inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="140">Steroids are widely used as an immunosuppressor to treat sars to reduce inflammation damage.</seg>
<seg id="141">However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial to severe lung injuries in sars and covid-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="142">Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially ischemic bone necrosis, which seriously affect prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nonetheless, short-range treatment is recommended for patients with critical covid-19 patients with cautious use of medium and low doses of corticovid-19</seg>
<seg id="144">At the time of writing, effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="145">However, redsiway, a nuclear-a nuclear-like -- intravenous drug has been found to be effective for a covid-19 patient in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="146">Redsiway is a new antivirus drug developed by gilid, originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and marburg virus.</seg>
<seg id="147">Later, it was also shown that redsiway may inhibit other single-chain rna viruses, including mers and sars viruses.</seg>
<seg id="148">For these reasons, gilied has made the medicine available to China for two clinical trials for SARS-Cov-2 infected people with the results of which are expected.</seg>
<seg id="149">In addition, Barrick Tini, Alpha-Interferon, lopinavi / litonavee and libaverin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="150">Lopinawi / litonavi could be associated with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other negative reactions.</seg>
<seg id="151">The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.</seg>
<seg id="152">Blood Plasma And Antibody Generation of recovered patients</seg>
<seg id="153">Patients recovering from infectious diseases has a long history of collecting blood for treating other patients suffering from the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection.</seg>
<seg id="154">In fact, recovered patients typically contain relatively high levels of antibodies targeting pathogens in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="155">Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (IG) produced by b lymphocytes used to combat pathogens and other foreign objects that identify unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.</seg>
<seg id="156">Based on this principle, blood was collected from the blood of a group of covid-19 patients who had recovered and injected to 10 critically ill patients.</seg>
<seg id="157">Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while declining inflammation and viral load and increased blood oxygen saturation.</seg>
<seg id="158">However, before specific treatments are developed, it is necessary to verify and clarified to propose methods that can be used on a massive scale.</seg>
<seg id="159">Also, given the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings related to blood plasma should be carefully considered.</seg>
<seg id="160">For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can be life -</seg>
<seg id="161">Antibody Concentrations in the blood are usually lower, while there is a high demand for treatment of critical patients.</seg>
<seg id="162">It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="163">Therefore, a more critical and practical way is to separate b cells from the body of a recovered patient and identify genetic codes for effective antibodies, or screening effective antibodies against the protein necessary for the virus.</seg>
<seg id="164">In this way, we can easily expand the production of antibody.</seg>
<seg id="165">In China, TCM has been used to treat multiple diseases for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="166">However, its therapeutic effect depends heavily on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, which vary according to TCM theory of disease diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.</seg>
<seg id="168">Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for covid-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe illness.</seg>
<seg id="169">For example, the wind detoxification capsules and concoction capsules have been found to be effective for covid-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="170">In several provinces of China, 87 % of patients use TCM treatment, among which the highest healing rates of covid-19 patients were observed, including gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %) while hubei province uses TCM treatment in only about 30 % of covid-19 patients with the lowest healing rate (13 %).</seg>
<seg id="171">However, this is just a rough comparison, as many other influential factors such as the number and gravity of patients should be included in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="172">On December 18, 2020, Zhang Bury and his colleagues released a study comparing western medicine (WM) treatment alone treatment with wm and TCM.</seg>
<seg id="173">They found that the time needed to recover, symptoms disappear and hospitalization in the wm+tcm group was significantly shorter than the simple wm group.</seg>
<seg id="174">Most impressive, the symptoms deterioration rate of the wm+tcm group (from light to heavy) is significantly lower than the simple wm group (7.4 % to 46.2 %) and the death rate of wm+tcm group is also lower than the simple wm group (8.8 % vs 39 %).</seg>
<seg id="175">Nonetheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality control tests, larger scale and more centers to be confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="176">Characterizing the mechanism of TCM treatment or its combination and, where possible, explaining its effective ingredients will also be of concern.</seg>
<seg id="177">Most patients suspected or diagnosed with covid-19 tend to be extremely fears of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those who are isolated feel bored, lonely and angry.</seg>
<seg id="178">In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse reactions such as insomnia caused by lesteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.</seg>
<seg id="179">A series of psychological responses were reported in the early stages of sars outbreak, including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental motor excitement, psychiatric symptoms, delirium and</seg>
<seg id="180">As part of the public health response to the covid-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and segregation will increase anxiety and guilt about the effects of infection, segregation and stigma on their families and friends.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mental Health care should therefore be provided to covid-19 patients, suspected cases, close contact and the public in need.</seg>
<seg id="182">Mental support should include building multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates on SARS-Cov-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and avoiding close contact using professional electronic devices and apps.</seg>
<seg id="183">Effective vaccines are crucial to disruption of transmission chains from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable host, and often serve as a complement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.</seg>
<seg id="184">The industry has worked to develop vaccines based on s protein to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and / or protective immune against SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="185">The live vaccine has been evaluated in sars animal models.</seg>
<seg id="186">However, before the clinical study was launched, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and deadly assault models and their protective effect on common toxic infections in humans and animals had not been identified.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is probably because sars disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.</seg>
<seg id="188">By contrast, due to the continuing common source of human and livestock disease in the epidemic areas, there are sporadic cases and aggregate cases of mers in the middle east and spread to other regions.</seg>
<seg id="189">Vaccination strategies have been developed for mers, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, through the use of inactive virus, viral carrier, Nano Particles, viral particles, and recombinations.</seg>
<seg id="190">Developing safe and effective vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="191">However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time needed for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and dynamic changes in cov.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a new type of disease, Covid-19 has just begun to show its full clinical process in thousands of patients.</seg>
<seg id="193">In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, similar to sars and mers, Covid-19 patients also have high prevalence and mortality rates.</seg>
<seg id="195">Therefore, building prognosis models for the disease is crucial for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="196">According to clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect prognosis of covid-19 patients (Table (table33):</seg>
<seg id="197">Age: age is the most important factor influencing sars prognosis, as well as for covid-19</seg>
<seg id="198">As previously mentioned, in a study that includes 8,866 cases, Covid-19 mainly occurred in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7 % of patients over 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="199">Patients in need of critical care are more likely to have basic syndrome and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need serious care (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting the age is covid-19 a prognosis factor in patient's outcome.</seg>
<seg id="200">Gender: as previously mentioned, more men are infected with SARS-Cov-2 than women (0.31/10 million against 0.27/10 million).</seg>
<seg id="201">Syndrome and complications: Covid-19 patients who need serious care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.</seg>
<seg id="202">Heart Events are also the leading cause of death in sars patients.</seg>
<seg id="203">Sars-Cov-2 can also be combined with ace2 positive bile duct cells, which could lead to liver abnormal in covid-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="204">It is noteworthy that age is closely related to basic diseases and may affect each other.</seg>
<seg id="205">Lab results are abnormal: the c-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflects the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and is seen as a potential prognosis factor for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery</seg>
<seg id="206">The correlation between crp levels and the gravity and prognosis of covid-19 was also raised.</seg>
<seg id="207">In addition, the rise of Lactic Dehydrogenase (Ldh), Amino Transfer Enzyme (AST), Acine Amino Transfer Enzyme (Alt) and muscle acid kinase (ck) may also help predict the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="208">These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue injury.</seg>
<seg id="209">Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="210">Major Clinical Symptoms: chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of covid-19</seg>
<seg id="211">Steroids Use: as previously mentioned, steroids are immunoinhibitors, often used as an auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the extent of inflammation damage.</seg>
<seg id="212">As high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in heavy sars patients, many survivors suffer from ischemic bone necrosis, leading to lifetime disabilities and poor quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="213">Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and short time in covid-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mental Stress: as previously mentioned, many patients were under great pressure during the covid-19 outbreak because they often suffer from chronic isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of relatives and sick friends.</seg>
<seg id="215">Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and get back to normal life.</seg>
<seg id="216">According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological features of covid-19 appear to differ from SARS.</seg>
<seg id="217">In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also be effectively replicated in upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or asymptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other cov that cause common cold</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, infected people can produce a large number of viruses during the early or incubation period during daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="219">However, SARS-Cov spread is believed to occur during severe condition, and most of the spread does not occur at the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="220">Thus, the current covid-19 outbreak is more severe and uncontrollable than sars.</seg>
<seg id="221">China is currently making great efforts, including blocking wuhan and surrounding cities, and continuing segregation of almost all its population, with a view to interrupting the spread of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="222">While these measures have caused severe damage to China's economy and other areas, the number of new cases is declining, suggesting that the epidemic is slowing.</seg>
<seg id="223">The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in January and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.</seg>
<seg id="224">However, some other experts are less optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="225">Paul Hunter and others estimate that covid-19 is significantly more contagious than sars and will not end in 2020</seg>
<seg id="226">Ira Longini and others have built models to predict the consequences of the epidemic, BELIEVING SARS-Cov-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.</seg>
<seg id="227">A TEAM IN CANADA REPORTS THAT SARS-Cov-2 was detected in middle nasal and Swabs-2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a similar type cyclical epidemics from flu.</seg>
<seg id="228">However, as the number of new cases decreases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.</seg>
<seg id="229">Ebola has been predicted to cause 1000 million cases and 500 million deaths.</seg>
<seg id="230">However, through strict isolation, the disease is finally under control.</seg>
<seg id="231">Similar to SARS-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 Contagion could weaken, eventually disappear or become less pathogenic viruses coexist with the human body.</seg>
<seg id="232">Below is a comparison of the covid-19 outbreak with sars and mers (Fig). 55).</seg>
<seg id="233">Sars-Cov-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through cough or sneezing, or even by direct contact with items contaminated with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="234">The virus has also been found in the poop, increasing the likelihood of spreading.</seg>
<seg id="235">A recent study that includes 138 cases, 41 % of cases may be caused by intra-hospital infections, including 17 previously suffering from other diseases and 40 medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="236">Therefore, tighter precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially paramedics, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have been in contact with patients or infected.</seg>
<seg id="237">The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 Dust Masks (1860 S Series) help control the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="238">Surgical masks prevent droplets from potentially infected people from spreading in the air or adhesive to the surface of items that may be passed to others.</seg>
<seg id="239">However, only n95(1860 S Series) Masks Prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 NM, with only 5 % of the viruses can penetrate fully; SARS-Cov-2 the size is similar to SARS-Cov, all around 85 NM.</seg>
<seg id="240">Since viral particles can even penetrate five stack surgical masks, paramedics directly contact with patients must wear n95(1860 S Series) masks instead of surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="241">In addition to masks, paramedics should also wear isolation clothes to further reduce exposure to the virus.</seg>
<seg id="242">The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.</seg>
<seg id="243">On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-Cov-2 while wearing a n95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammatory eyes.</seg>
<seg id="244">Therefore, paramedics should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.</seg>
<seg id="245">For the public in areas affected or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that all people use sterilized soap more frequently than usual, stay indoor self-isolated and limit exposure to potential infected people.</seg>
<seg id="246">Three Feet is thought to be the right distance for people to stay away from patients.</seg>
<seg id="247">These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="248">While Sars-Cov-2 is breaking into the human world as a new virus, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS OUTBREAK, reported on January 7, 2020-Cov's high homology should have raised China's heightened alert.</seg>
<seg id="249">However, until December 19, 2020, the director of the wuhan city center for disease prevention and control was still appealing the public, saying that the new virus is not contagious, the possibility of human to-to-to-to-to-person, and that the outbreak is control.</seg>
<seg id="250">The news apparently relaxed public vigilance, and the Chinese new year is approaching, which is missing out on the key point in wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="251">China's disease control agencies could learn this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="252">For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements because every word is crucial to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive to abnormal information from hospitals instead of waiting for official reports from doctors or officials ;(3) tighter control of potential outbreaks at the early stages rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) conduct more frequently targeted and effective drills to improve public awareness epidemics awareness and regularly test and improve social response systems.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Covid-19 outbreak, caused by the new virus SARS-Cov-2 began in late January 2019</seg>
<seg id="254">At the time of writing, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe in less than two months.</seg>
<seg id="255">Since the virus is very similar to SARS-Cov and symptoms between covid-19 and sars, the covid-19 outbreak looks like sars recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="256">However, there are some notable differences between covid-19 and sars, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.</seg>
<seg id="257">Covid-19 affects more older people than young, more males than women, and older patients are more severe and mortality rates than younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="258">Sars has a higher mortality rate than covid-19 (10.91 % against 1.44 %).</seg>
<seg id="259">Even without symptoms, Covid-19 patients still spread the virus, while sars patients usually spread the virus when they are serious condition, making controlling covid-19 spread far more difficult than sars.</seg>
<seg id="260">This part explains why sars-Cov-2 spread far faster and widely than SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="261">In some covid-19 patients, regular RNA TESTS FOR SARS-Cov-2 may be negative.</seg>
<seg id="262">On the other hand, healed patients may turn to the sun again.</seg>
<seg id="263">These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="264">Considering the research on covid-19 is so fast, the following key issues remain to be addressed:</seg>
<seg id="265">WHERE DID SARS-Cov-2 come from?</seg>
<seg id="266">Despite 96 % genetic homology found between SARS-Cov-2 and two bat-like cov, we still cannot draw the conclusion that SARS-Cov-2 comes from the bat.</seg>
<seg id="267">What animal is spreading the virus from the original host -- presumably bat -- to humans?</seg>
<seg id="268">Without knowing the answers to questions 1 AND 2, we can't effectively cut the transmission pathways and the outbreak could resurgence anytime.</seg>
<seg id="269">While molecular models and biochemical analysis have proven that SARS-Cov-2 combines with ace2, how does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?</seg>
<seg id="270">Does the virus also combine cells that express ace2 in other organs?</seg>
<seg id="271">Without Clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</seg>
<seg id="272">How long will the outbreak last?</seg>
<seg id="273">How did viruses evolve during human-to-person?</seg>
<seg id="274">Will it become a global pandemic? DISAPPEAR LIKE SARS? Or will it recurve regularly like flu?</seg>
<seg id="275">Finding answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but it may take longer.</seg>
<seg id="276">However, regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and get our lives back to normal as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="47">On December 16, 2020, the university of Waterloo Canada announced the design of a dna-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.</seg>
<seg id="48">Researchers used bacteria to design dna as replicating inside human bacteria to produce harmless viral particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 virus.</seg>
<seg id="49">In December 2020, the U.S. Government, industry and three universities gathered resources and combine cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft and google to access ibm's supercomputers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some vaccines have heterogenic effects, also known as non-specific effects.</seg>
<seg id="51">This means they have other benefits than preventing disease.</seg>
<seg id="52">Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care workers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Vaccines in development may not be safe or ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="54">Early research to evaluate vaccine effectiveness with covid-19 specific animal models such as ace2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, suggests that biosafety level 3 is needed to be taken to deal with live viruses curb measures and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized security procedures.</seg>
<seg id="55">Vaccines for sars and mers have been tested in non-human animal models.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of 2020, there were no safe and effective sars treatment or preventative vaccines for humans.</seg>
<seg id="57">According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new types of vaccines and drugs used to treat sars is a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide. In addition, there are currently no effective vaccine for mers.</seg>
<seg id="58">During the mers epidemic, it was thought that existing sars research could provide useful templates for developing vaccines and treatments for mers-Cov infections.</seg>
<seg id="59">As of December 2020, one (DNA-based) Mers vaccine had completed stage I human clinical trial, and three more vaccines are under development, all of them viral vectors, both of them adenovirus carrier vaccine (Chadox1-Mers, Bvrs-Gamvac), a MVA CARRIER VACCINE (MVA-Mers-s).</seg>
<seg id="60">Various social media articles have fuelled conspiracy theories, claiming the virus behind covid-19 has been found and vaccines are available.</seg>
<seg id="61">Patents quoted in various social media articles refer to the gene sequences of other corona viruses (such as sars corovirus) and patents for vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ace2 is an enzyme attached to the extracellular surface (cell membrane) in lungs, artery, heart, kidney and intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ace2 is expected to be the drug target for treating cardiovascular disease by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ang (1-7) content. Ace2 is also the entrance point for certain corona viruses into cells.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Human Source Version of this enzyme is commonly known as hace2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Angiotenin Converting Enzinc-2 is a zinc metal enzinc-containing enzyme located on the surface of endo</seg>
<seg id="5">Ace2 protein consists of an n-End Peptide Enzyme M2 domain and a c-End Collectrin Kidney Amino Acid Transporter Protein Domain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ace2 is a single-pass I membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is exposed to cell surfaces of lungs and other tissue.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another enzyme known as sheddase (Sheddase) breaks ace2's extracellular domain from the transmembrane domain, releasing soluble protein into the blood and eventually excretion to urine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ace2 exists in most organs: ace2 is attached to cell membrane, mainly lung type ii lung, intestinal epithelial cells, arteries and vein endothelial cells of most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ace2 Mrna expressions were also found in cerebral cortex, tattoms, lower thalamus and brain stem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ace2's main function is to check and balance ace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ace cracks angiotenin I into vascular tension ii with vascular contraction activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ace2 then cracks angiotensin II (ASP-Arg-Val-Tyr-His-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzed it into vascular tensin (1-7)), (H-ASP-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-oh).</seg>
<seg id="13">Ace2 can also crack a number of other peptides, including DEARINE 9 Slow-induced peptides, Apelin (Apelin), neurodepressin, endorphine a and stomach starvation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ace2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral amino acids transporter protein slc6a19 and is associated with hartnup.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a transmembrane protein, ace2 is the main entry point for certain corona viruses into cells, including hcov-nl63; SARS-Cov (the virus that leads to SARS); and SARS-Cov-Cov-2 (leading to covid-19 viral).</seg>
<seg id="16">More specifically, s1 puncture protein from SARS-COV AND SARS-Cov2 Combine with the enzyme domain on the cell surface, leading to endotonation, bringing viruses and enzyme to the core inside the cells.</seg>
<seg id="17">Such an entry process also requires host serine protease tmprss2 triggered s protein activation, and the inhibiting of the process is currently being studied as a potential cure. Some speculate that lower ace2 levels in cells may help combat infection.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, multiple professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ace inhibitors and arb therapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis released on December 2012 found that " the use of ace inhibitors can significantly lower the risk of pneumonia by 34 % compared to the control group %".</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, " for patients with high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, using ace inhibitors can also reduce the risk of pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of ace inhibitors is also linked to lower pneumonia-related mortality rates, but the results are less reliable as reliable as reducing</seg>
<seg id="22">Recombinant Ace2 (rhace2) is considered a new method for treating acute lung injury, which appears to improve lung hemodynamics index and blood oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="23">Rahace2 has a half-life in the human body of about 10 hours, with an effective time of 30 minutes and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some findings suggest that rahace2 may be a promising future for patients with the classic renin-Angiotensin System (Ras) inhibitors or a high circulation angiotensin ii level medicine.

<seg id="1">The 2019-2020 Corovirus outbreak is a 2019 new type of covid-19 (Covid-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">The outbreak was confirmed in wuhan, China on January 12, 2019, 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern, 3, 2020 the day was identified as an epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of December 2020, 4, 1610 million covid-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide, killing about 97 million people,</seg>
<seg id="4">Healed About 364 million people.</seg>
<seg id="5">China has a disease death rate of about 4 percent, while disease deaths vary between 0.08 % (New Zealand) and 13.04 % (Algeria).</seg>
<seg id="6">Common symptoms include fever, cough and gas promotion.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incubation period from exposure to illness ranged from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are currently no vaccines or special antiviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinical Treatment is mainly supported by symptoms. Recommended precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth during cough, keeping safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspected people.</seg>
<seg id="11">Official Agencies across countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The outbreak has caused severe global socioeconomic shocks, with sporting, religious, political and cultural activities postponing or cancellation, while panic shopping has exacerbated widespread supply shortages.</seg>
<seg id="13">193 countries and regions around the world have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting about 99.4 % of primary and higher education students.</seg>
<seg id="14">As fake viral information spreads online, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other east and appearance groups of east and Southeast Asian Origin, as well as groups in regions with severe epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, reduced travel and heavy industry closures have led to a decline in api and carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">On December 2019, 12, the health department of Wuhan (Capital of hubei province) reported a batch of unknown cause pneumonia cases and opened an investigation in early January 2020</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of these cases are related to South China's seafood wholesale market, so the new corovirus is believed to be a common human and animal</seg>
<seg id="18">The virus that sparked the outbreak, known as SARS-Cov-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the bat corona virus, PANGULAR VIRUS AND SARS-Cov. The earliest patient discovered was later confirmed to have a disease on December 1, 2019, with no apparent connection to the group of cases in South China's seafood market.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two thirds of the early cases reported in January 2019 were confirmed to be linked to the South China seafood market.</seg>
<seg id="20">On December 3, 2020, the South China morning post published an unconfirmed report saying the first case may date back to January 17, 2019, 11, the patient was 55-Year-old male, from hubei province. On December 26, 2020, according to the world health organization reported a decline in China, but new reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea suddenly increased, and new cases outside China for the first time, the number exceeded the territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially those of minor disorders.</seg>
<seg id="22">As of December 26, relatively few cases were reported among teenagers, with only 2.4 % of teenagers aged 19 and under globally, Patrick Varan, UK Chief Scientific Advisor the UK needs about 60 % of its population infected with the new corovirus to get effective mass immunization.</seg>
<seg id="23">The number of cases is the number of people who have been tested by Covid-19 and confirmed positive results according to the official program.</seg>
<seg id="24">As of December 23, countries around the world accounted for less than 3 % of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies for non-detection of people with minor disorders, including Italy countries such as li, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="25">An estimated 86 % of covid-19 infected people in China are undetected and those undocumented infections, according to a study published on January 16 people are the source of infection in 79 % of recorded cases.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to a statistic analysis released on January 30, the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of reported cases.</seg>
<seg id="27">Covid-19 basic infections (R0) was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4</seg>
<seg id="28">A study published by the CDC suggests r0 could be 5.7.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most Covid-19 patients can recover.</seg>
<seg id="30">Patients who are unable to recover from illness to death is 6-41 days most common in 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="31">As of January 4, 2020, about 97 million people have died from covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="32">As of December 5, about 80 % of deaths in China were over 60 and 75 % of deaths accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official Statistics on covid-19 deaths usually refer to those who have positive results from new corovirus tests according to official programs.</seg>
<seg id="33">The actual covid-19 death toll may be far more than the statistic, as the data may not include untested patients, such as those who died at home, nursing homes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some data from Italy show that the actual death toll during the outbreak is 4-5 times the official number of new corovirus pneumonia deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A CDC spokeswoman admits, " we know [the number of deaths] is lower than actual numbers :" and rumours of underrated U.S. data confirms this statement :" underestimation is common in epidemics, such as the H1n1 swine flu outbreak in 2009 on December 9, 2020, 1, China's first confirmed death case appeared in wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first death case outside China appeared in the Philippines on December 1, and the first death outside Asia on January 14 was in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">As of December 28, more than a dozen deaths occurred outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each.</seg>
<seg id="38">As of December 13, more than 40 countries and regions had reported deaths in all continents other than Antarctica. There are several methods commonly used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="39">These numbers vary from region to region and will vary over time, and be affected by demographic features such as age, quality of health systems, treatment, the first outbreak and general health status. The disease death rate is the result of the number of deaths over a given time period divided by the number of diagnosed people.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to John Hopkins University Statistics, the global death rate was 6.0 % (97,039/1,617,204) as of January 10</seg>
<seg id="41">Death rates vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="42">In China, the estimated death rate of illness fell from 17.3 % (patients who fell from 1 to 10 to 0.7 % in January 1). Patients with illness after day). other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infectious mortality (Ifr), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of diagnosed people diagnosed, which reflects the number of deaths from diseases (including diagnosed and undiagnosed) percentage.</seg>
<seg id="43">These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many scholars try to calculate the above data for specific populations.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Overall death rate of infections ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 percent, according to Oxford's center for evidence-based medicine.</seg>
<seg id="46">The estimated value cap for the range is consistent with Germany's first random test of covid-19, as well as a statistic analysis study on the effects of detection on cfr estimates.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health organization says the outbreak is controllable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and vary from region to region.</seg>
<seg id="49">Maciej Boni from Penn State University: " if unchecked, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually go into stagnation after existing hosts run out and then begin to ease :"</seg>
<seg id="50">But at the moment, it's almost impossible for us to predict when the inflection will appear."</seg>
<seg id="51">Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, believes that if all countries mobilize to adopt the world health organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, then "ending the epidemic can be expected".</seg>
<seg id="52">Adam Kucharski from the London school of health and tropical medicine said SARS-Cov-2 " could be repeated outbreaks that lasts for one or two years."</seg>
<seg id="53">A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of technology shows that " before vaccines are put into use (it could take 18 months or more)," it is important to keep physical distance and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="54">William Schaffner from Vanderburg University: " this corona virus is highly spreading and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely," could turn into a seasonal disease that erupts once a year."</seg>
<seg id="55">The Pathogenesis of a renewed outbreak depends on group immunity and mutation.</seg>
<seg id="56">The symptoms of covid-19 are relatively non-specific and some infected people may be symptomatic.</seg>
<seg id="57">The two most common symptoms are fever (88 %) and dry cough (68 %).</seg>
<seg id="58">Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory phlegm (phlegm), loss of smell, gas, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, giggle, diarrhoea or cyanosis. According to the world health organization, about one in six patients will turn into disorders and have breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="59">The CDC listed as emergency symptoms of breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden blurred consciousness, hard to wake up and hair on face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms, it is recommended for immediate treatment. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.</seg>
<seg id="60">Some infected people may be asymptomatic and without any clinical manifestation, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observations and screening of close contact with confirmed patients to exclude the possibility of infection.</seg>
<seg id="61">China estimates that the rate of asymptomatic infections ranged from very low to 44 percent.</seg>
<seg id="62">Incubation Period (time interval from infection to onset) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days are most common. with regard to uncertainty, it can be illustrated by one example: the proportion of patients who lost smell in covid-19 patients was originally estimated to 30 % and later dropped to 15 %.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some details on the pathway the disease is transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="64">The disease is currently believed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and foam produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact refers to an interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 ft).</seg>
<seg id="65">Research found that an unblocked cough could cause foam to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 ft)-8.2 M (15-27 ft).</seg>
<seg id="66">It has also been suggested that the foam produced when people speak for a longer stay in the air could also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, people can also produce foam when they breathe or talk.</seg>
<seg id="67">This foam may fall into the mouth and nose of people around them and even be sucked into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR could spray respiratory secretions and thus cause air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="69">Also, if a person touches the virus-contaminated surface (including skin) and then touches his own eye, nose and mouth, it can cause the virus to spread.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through poop, but the risk is considered lower.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-Cov-2 dung mouth spread. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after it, but it is also contagious before and after illness.</seg>
<seg id="72">Positive results can be detected as early as three days before the disease, suggesting that the new corovirus was contagious before visible symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Despite the rare number of cases diagnosed by the lab, some countries have detected symptomatic infections in the course of contact tracking investigations.</seg>
<seg id="74">The European center for disease control (Ecdc) said that while the spread of the new corovirus is not entirely clear, the average of 1 PEOPLE CAN INFECT 2-3 people. The virus lives on the surface of the object ranged from hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="75">Specifically, the new corovirus is known to survive on plastic (Polyacrylic) and 304 Stainless Steel for up to three days, surviving on cardboard for a day and up to four hours on copper.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature. There are currently positive cases of pets and other animals covid-19</seg>
<seg id="77">There is currently no evidence that animals will re-infect the virus to humans, but official uk authorities suggest people wash their hands after exposure to animals, just like contact with surfaces that may be infected.</seg>
<seg id="78">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new virus that was first isolated from 3 pneumonia patients in wuhan.</seg>
<seg id="79">All the features of this new sars-Cov-2 virus are present in nature's associated corona virus. The virus can be killed with home soap before it gets into the human body because soap can dissolve the protective cystic film of the virus. Sars-Cov-2 is closely related to the ORIGINAL SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is currently considered a common disease in humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="81">Genetic analysis shows that the corona virus is genetically cluster with becovirus subgenus subgenus (cluster b) and two bat-borne strains.</seg>
<seg id="82">The new corovirus is consistent with other batcov ratg13 at the whole genome level %.</seg>
<seg id="83">In December 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in the pangular body was only one amino acids in some parts of the genome sequence.</seg>
<seg id="84">As of now, the whole genome comparison found that up to 92 % of the genetic material between the pangria and SARS-Cov-2 is not enough to prove that the pangerture is the middle host.</seg>
<seg id="85">Whether or not the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed based on symptoms, but ultimately, it will still be diagnosed through reversible polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrrt-PCR) or ct imaging</seg>
<seg id="86">A comparison study of pcr and ct in wuhan shows that ct is obviously more sensitive than pcr, but less specific, many imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease development processes.</seg>
<seg id="87">As of December 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that " ct is not suitable for screening Covid-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."</seg>
<seg id="88">The World Health organization has now unveiled several nuclear acid testing programs for SARS-Cov-2, the first one released on January 17</seg>
<seg id="89">Nuclear acid detection uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrt-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="90">Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.</seg>
<seg id="91">Results can normally be made within hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="92">Generally speaking, this test is done through nasopharyngeal swab and can also be done via swabbing. Many Labs and companies are developing serology tests to detect antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="93">As of December 6, 2020, none of these testing methods have proven accurate enough to approve widespread use.</seg>
<seg id="94">In The United States, serology tests developed by cellex have been approved for certified labs for emergency use only.</seg>
<seg id="95">Typical imaging features of x-slices and computer tomography scanning (CT) in patients include asymmetrict and asymmetrict.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database for the image performance of diagnosed cases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Due to overlap with other viral infections (such as adenovirus), unconfirmed images are limited in identifying covid-19</seg>
<seg id="98">A large study in China compared chest ct results to pcr results, although images are less specific to identify infections, it is faster and more sensitive, so it can be considered as a screening tool in popular areas. PM</seg>
<seg id="99">A Convolutional Neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed that combines x-slices and ct to detect images of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="100">Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding directly touching the nose and mouth of the eye and mouth, covering your nose when coughing or sneezing, and used tissues directly into the trash can.</seg>
<seg id="101">Suspected infected people should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.</seg>
<seg id="102">Measures to keep physical distance are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have limited or suggested avoiding unnecessary commuting to countries and regions affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="103">However, the virus has now reached a community spread phase in much of the globe.</seg>
<seg id="104">This means the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents have no idea where they are or how they are infected. Paramedics who are in contact with suspected infections should take standard precautions, exposure to precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important tool for health regulators to identify sources of contagion and prevent further spread.</seg>
<seg id="105">The Government's use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has sparked privacy concerns, with more than 100 groups such as amnesty international issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="106">There are currently various mobile apps that have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use on a voluntary basis, and as of January 7, more than a dozen expert groups are working on exploring solutions with privacy protection features such as use Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other phones.</seg>
<seg id="107">Users will receive a message reminder once they have close contact with positive patients with the covid-19 test results. False statements about prevention of infection continue to spread; such as washing nose and rinse with mouthwash are ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="108">There is currently no covid-19 vaccine yet, but many organizations are actively developing.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing your hands.</seg>
<seg id="110">The CDC recommends people to wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are visible dirt on their hands, before meal and after blowing, cough or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="111">This is because the virus can destroy its protective cystic film by using home soap before entering the human body.</seg>
<seg id="112">The CDC also suggested that alcohol-containing hand washing detergent with at least 60 % alcohol content can be used if there is no soap and tap water around you.</seg>
<seg id="113">The World Health organization advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.</seg>
<seg id="114">Object Surface can be sterilized with multiple solutions (sterilization solution can be effective within one minute), including 62-71 % ethanol, 50-100 % Isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorate, 0.5 0.2-7.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5 % Polyvione Iodine.</seg>
<seg id="115">Other Solutions (such as benzachlorol and Chlorine Glucose) are less effective.</seg>
<seg id="116">The CDC recommends that if new type of corovirus pneumonia cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or daycare, disinfect all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote control and Atms used by patients, etc.</seg>
<seg id="117">Who is recommending people to cover their nose with curved elbows or tissues when cough or sneezing, and dispose of all contaminated tissues immediately.</seg>
<seg id="118">It is recommended that people suspected to wear medical surgical masks because wearing masks can reduce the amount of foam exhale when talking, sneezing and cough and shorten the spread distance.</seg>
<seg id="119">The World Health organization has issued a note on the occasion and how to use masks.</seg>
<seg id="120">"wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is also recommended to take care of suspected of infection". people wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="121">The World Health organization recommends that healthy people should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for taking care of covid-19 patients, but the organization also recognises that wearing masks helps avoid face touching.</seg>
<seg id="122">Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="123">CDC suggests wearing non-medical masks made of cloth. China explicitly recommends healthy citizens to wear disposable medical masks, especially in close contact with others (1 M (3 FT)).</seg>
<seg id="124">Hong Kong, China suggests wearing masks when travelling public transport or entering crowded places.</seg>
<seg id="125">Thai health officials advise people to make masks and wash daily.</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly forbidden from entering public places without masks or blocking mouth and nose.</seg>
<seg id="127">On December 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Austrian government rules that masks are required for all entering the grocery store.</seg>
<seg id="129">Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.</seg>
<seg id="130">Taiwan has produced 1,0000 million masks per day since mid-December, China, and it is required to wear masks on trains and intercity buses since January 1</seg>
<seg id="131">Panama has made it necessary to wear masks when going out, and suggests homemade masks for residents who cannot afford them.</seg>
<seg id="132">Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="133">Infection Prevention and control measures for maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close contact between people and thus slowing the spread of disease.</seg>
<seg id="134">Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension of work and closing stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="135">The measures that individuals can take in terms of maintaining social distance include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding access to crowded areas, switching non-contact greeting and physical distance from others.</seg>
<seg id="136">Now, many governments have mandatory or suggested social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="137">On the largest mass concentration scale, U.S. government agencies and who initially suggested 250 people (in areas without covid-19 spread), then quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10 people.</seg>
<seg id="138">On January 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.

<seg id="1">Covid-19 workplace prevention and control</seg>
<seg id="2">Covid-19 workplace prevention and control is the prevention of corona disease 2019 (Covid-19).</seg>
<seg id="3">The appropriateness of workplace hazard control depends on specific work site and work tasks and should be determined based on risk assessment of exposed sources, the extent of disease in the community and risk factors that may be exposed to covid-19</seg>
<seg id="4">As required by the United States administration of career safety and health (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have the least professional exposure to the public and other colleagues, therefore recommend basic infections prevention measures, including hand washing to encourage employees to segregation after illness, abide by breathing etiquette and daily cleaning and sterilize the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moderate exposure work includes jobs that require regular or close contact with unknown or suspected covid-19 patients who can be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Including staff who reach out to the general public, such as schools, high-density working environments and some mass retail environments.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to basic infection precautions, the group should also use efficient air filter and sneezing protectors for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and other dangerous prevention measures in contact with covid-19 patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">OSHA believes that medical and mortuary staff who are exposed to known or suspected covid-19 patients are at high exposure if the staff performed aerosol-producing operation on known or suspected covid-19 patients the risk of exposure becomes extremely high when specimens are collected or dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dangerous Prevention and control measures for such personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Covid-19 outbreak could have a serious impact in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff members may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods, or changes in access to these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or using delivery or free delivery services).</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, product logistics from covid-19 outbreak areas could be interrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection action.</seg>
<seg id="14">These plans address levels of risk associated with various workplace and tasks, including exposure to sources, risk factors from family and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers such as elderly or groups suffering from chronic illness.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plans also outlines the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to obey national or local advice.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goals in response to outbreak include reducing the spread of workers, protecting people at high risk of bad health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the response can be affected by the extent of disease in the communities where the business is located.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hazard Prevention Level is a widely used prevention and control framework in career safety and health, which is used to group risk prevention and control measures based on effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the hazards of covid-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal protection equipment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Engineering control means segregating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on employee s' behavior, which is the least cost solution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Administrative Control means changing work policies or procedures that require staff or employers to act on their own.</seg>
<seg id="23">PPE's anti-control effect is less effective than engineering control and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposure.</seg>
<seg id="24">All types of ppe must be chosen according to the risk level facing staff, equipped according to the applicable circumstances (such as breathing apparatus) and must always be properly worn, regularly checked and maintained, replacements as necessary, and properly discharged, clean, store or treat to avoid pollution.</seg>
<seg id="25">Low-exposure jobs have the least career exposure to the public and other colleagues, according to OSHA.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is recommended that all workplace should take basic infection prevention measures, including washing their hands regularly, recommend that sick employees stay isolation, cough or sneezing, obey breathing etiquette, provide tissues and trash cans, be prepared for telecommute when necessary. Discouraging employees from using other s' tools and equipment, and keep the workplace clean and sterilized everyday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Timely identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) suggests that employees who exhibiting acute respiratory symptoms should be separated for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no fever, fever, fever symptoms and any other symptoms, sick leave policies should be implemented family care for sick families and staff should be clearly informed of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to OSHA, moderate exposure work involves frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected covid-19 patients within 6 Feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to ongoing communities near the workplace Sars-Cov-2 JOBS ARE SARS-2 due to possible recent visit to covid-19 epidemic areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">Such staff include those working in schools, high population density working environments and some mass retail environments that will be exposed to the general public. Engineering controls aimed at this and high-risk groups include installing efficient air filter, improving ventilation, transparent plastic sneezing protectors and installation of physical barriers, and installing free windows to provide customer services. Administrative controls over this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to segregation, replacing face-to face meetings with virtual communication, setting up a mispeak shift system, cancelling unnecessary travel to the covid-19 outbreak site, and making emergency communication plans, including forum for answering staff questions, providing staff with updated education and training on covid-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, and training for staff who need to use protective clothing and protective gear providing resources and working environment that help improve personal hygiene, requires hand washing, limit customer and the public access to work site, and post signs on hand washing and other covid-19 protections. According to specific tasks, at least, staff at risk of moderate exposure should be equipped with Personal Protective Gear, including gloves, robe, masks or goggles.</seg>
<seg id="31">This type of staff better need a breathing apparatus.</seg>
<seg id="32">If someone is sick on a plane, proper protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient 6 Feet away from other passengers, designating a crew to serve the patient and provide masks to the patient, or ask patients to cover their nose with tissues while cough or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="33">The crew should wear disposable medical gloves while caring for sick travellers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces. The crew should also wear extra personal protective gear if the sick travelers have symptoms such as fever, continuous cough or breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="34">Gloves and other disposable items should be treated in bio-hazard bags, followed by cleaned and disinfect surfaces. For Commercial Transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous precautions also includes postponing travel when sick. If there is fever or other symptoms on board, self-isolation and notify the aboard medical room immediately.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated cabin. For Schools and childcare places, the CDC recommends that if the infected person has been present in school, it should be closed for a short term, regardless of the spread of the relevant schools and childcare places for thorough cleaning or disinfect.</seg>
<seg id="36">Social distance strategies can be implemented for low-and medium-scale community transmission, such as cancellation of other large gatherings, rallies and sports classes, choir classes or cafeteria dining, increasing the distance between the desk, misconfinity and departures, and departures, limiting unnecessary visitor visits and separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the community is spreading badly, in addition to social distance strategies, you can consider extending the suspension period. For Law enforcement officers carrying out routine routine activities, the CDC believes it faces lower direct health risks.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is recommended that law enforcement officers must be exposed to covid-19 diagnosed patients or suspected individuals should act at the same level of protection as first aid medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective gear.</seg>
<seg id="39">If close contact occurs during the arrest, the staff member should clean and disinfect their service belt and equipment before using household cleaning spray or rags before cleaning, and should follow standard personal protective gear sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.</seg>
<seg id="40">OSHA believes certain health care and mortuary staff are at high or very high exposure risks.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-exposure staff includes physical contact with medical care, support, labs and medical transport staff for people known or suspected covid-19 infected.</seg>
<seg id="42">The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff performs a foam generation program for known or suspected covid-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected to be infected.</seg>
<seg id="43">Foam Generation programs include plugs, cough induction procedures, bronchoscope examination, some dental procedures and examinations, or physical cavity collection.</seg>
<seg id="44">High-exposure mortuary staff included those involved in sorting the bodies of the dead, who were diagnosed or suspected cases of covid-19, and were at higher exposure if an autopsy was performed. Additional engineering measures to be taken against this group at risk also include isolation rooms for covid-19 diagnosed or suspected cases, including in the implementation of the foam generation program.</seg>
<seg id="45">Some healthcare facilities and morgue can also be equipped with dedicated negative pressure ventilation systems.</seg>
<seg id="46">Biosafety Level 3 precautions should be taken when dealing with specimens.</seg>
<seg id="47">The World Health Organization (world health organization) recommends setting different waiting areas for patients based on whether the patient is a suspected case of covid-19 among other personal protective gear, the oshs also recommends that people working within 6 Feet of patients known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-Cov-2 and those who perform the foam generation program be worn pm</seg>
<seg id="48">The United States requires the use of niosh-approved N95 filter masks or better masks in comprehensive written breathing protection programs environments such as health testing, training, medical examinations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Other types of breathing apparatus can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. Who does not recommend protective clothing because covid-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.</seg>
<seg id="50">Who suggested entry point screenters just wear medical surgical masks.</seg>
<seg id="51">For staff members who need to collect breathing specimens from covid-19 patients and provide care or transfer services for patients without having to carry out foam generation procedures, who suggests using medical surgical masks, goggles, robe and gloves pm</seg>
<seg id="52">Medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or ffp2 mask if you want to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="53">In view of the shortage of personal protection equipment globally, who recommends that direct caregivers be allowed only access to covid-19 patient s' rooms through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, only when it is indeed necessary to use personal protection equipment for specific tasks, continue to use the same breathing apparatus when nursing multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of Personal Protection Equipment Supply chain and discouraging asymask for asymask to reduce demand for personal protection equipment.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Common symptoms include fever, cough and gas promotion.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle pain, diarrhea, pharyngeal pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incubation period from exposure to illness ranged from 2-14 days, usually around 5 days.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although most cases have minor symptoms, some cases develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of December 2020, 4, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeded 2240 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 568,000 people are currently recovered from treatment. The virus spreads mainly through close contact between people, often by drops generated by cough, sneezing or talking.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although exhale produces foam, the foam usually falls to the ground or on the surface of various objects and does not cause long-range transmission.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also, if someone touches the virus-contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth, they can be infected with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">The virus can survive up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although early and recovery may also spread, it is the most contagious three days before the disease. Standard diagnostic method is to conduct real-time reversal polymerase chain reaction (Rrrrrt-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="12">People suspected of virus infection and their paramedics are advised to wear masks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Suggestions for public wear masks vary everywhere, with some authorities opposing wearing masks and others asking for masks.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are currently no covid-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most countries in all six who regions have reported partial transmission of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">People infected with the virus may be asymptoms or may have suspected flu symptoms such as fever, cough, inability and gas.</seg>
<seg id="17">Urgent symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or boobs, blurred consciousness, difficult to wake up and green face or lips; if these symptoms are recommended for immediate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="18">A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="19">Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were also detected.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some cases in China only appear to have chest boobs and palpitations at the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, Multi-organ failure and even cause death.</seg>
<seg id="22">We call this the incubation period.</seg>
<seg id="23">Covid-19 incubation period is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.</seg>
<seg id="24">97.5 % of infected people have symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. The report states that not all infected people have symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The role of asymptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, prima evidence suggests that asymptomatic infections may contribute to the spread</seg>
<seg id="26">The rate of asymptomatic infections has not been determined and research is still being stepped up. The South Korean centers for disease control and prevention (Kcdc) reported that 20 % of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.</seg>
<seg id="27">China's National Health commission on health has listed asymptomatic cases in daily notification since January 1; out of the 166 cases of 4 infected people on that day, 130 (78 %) are being tested time without symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sputum and saliva can carry a large amount of viruses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Speaking loudly spray more foam than normal speech.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study in Singapore found that an unblocked cough could cause foam to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 ft).</seg>
<seg id="31">Although such viruses are generally not transmitted through air, the National Academy of sciences has determined that it may be transmitted through bioaerosol, with positive samples of the air collectors outside the ward.</seg>
<seg id="32">Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR could spray respiratory secretions and thus cause air transmission.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are also concerns that the virus may spread through poop, but the risk is considered lower. The virus is most contagious when symptoms arise; although it may spread before symptoms, the risk is lower.</seg>
<seg id="34">The European center for disease control (Ecdc) said that while the spread of the new corovirus is not entirely clear, the average of 1 PEOPLE CAN INFECT 2-3 people. The virus lives on the surface of the object ranged from hours to days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specifically, the new corovirus is known to survive on cardboard for a day, with up to three days on plastic (Polyacrylic) and Stainless Steel (Aisi 304), with up to 99 % Purity Copper products four hours to survive.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.</seg>
<seg id="37">Soap and cleaners can also kill the virus if used correctly. Soap products can degrade the virus's fat protective layer, making it inactive while also clearing the virus from skin and other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other solutions such as benzadized ammonium chlorohexine glucose (a surgical sterilization) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China shows that saliva samples were collected on average two days after being admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="39">5/6 patients had the highest virus load in the first sample, while 1/6 patients detected the following day.</seg>
<seg id="40">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona virus that was first separated from three pneumonia patients in wuhan out.</seg>
<seg id="41">All the features of this new sars-Cov-2 virus are present in nature's associated corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before entering the human body, the virus can be killed with home soap because soap can destroy the virus's Protective Cystic Film. Sars-Cov-2 is closely related to the ORIGINAL SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lungs are the most affected organ affected by Covid-19, as the virus enters host cells through Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ace2), which has the highest content in type ii lung.</seg>
<seg id="44">The virus combines with ace2 and enter the host cell through a special surface sugar protein called " puncture</seg>
<seg id="45">12 % of patients admitted to hospitals in wuhan, China found acute myocardial injury, with a higher percentage of severe illness.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to deterioration of the disease and immune system disorders, but acute cardiovascular injury may also be linked to the heart's ace2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ace2 receptors express highly in the heart and participate in regulating heart function.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is reported that high rates of blood thrombosis (31 %) and vein ICU-19 infected people (25 %) and may be related to poor prognosis. An Autopsy of covid-19 dead patient found diffuse alveolar injury (Dad), with inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although Sars-Cov-2 is addictive to respiratory epithelial cells that express ace2, people with covid-19 severe inflammation will have a full body.</seg>
<seg id="50">In particular, pathogenic gm-CSF secretion t cells in covid-19 patients are linked to the collection of inflammatory il-6 secretive monocytes and severe lung pathology.</seg>
<seg id="51">Autopsy reports also saw lymphocytes infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Who has announced several disease detection programs.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Standard method is using real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrt-PCR).</seg>
<seg id="54">This test usually examines respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or phlegm samples can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="55">Generally, results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.</seg>
<seg id="56">Blood tests can also be performed, but two weeks between two blood samples are required, and results are hardly instant value.</seg>
<seg id="57">Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coroneal strains and publish gene sequences so that labs around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection agents to detect infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="58">As of December 4, 2020, Antibody Testing (not only can detect active infections but also whether an individual has been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not been promoted.</seg>
<seg id="59">According to China's experience, testing accuracy ranged from 60 to 70 %.</seg>
<seg id="60">On December 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved its first instant diagnostic reagent and put into use at the end of the month. The Diagnostic Guide Issued by Wuhan University's central south hospital proposes methods to detect infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risks.</seg>
<seg id="61">Early infections are mostly seen in double lung multi-Leaf Glass Shadow, with asymmetrical and rear distribution.</seg>
<seg id="62">As the virus develops, there may be subpleural dominance, gravel road symptoms (interval thickened with varying degrees of lung) and lung changes.</seg>
<seg id="63">Very little information about covid-19 micropathologic injuries and pathology.</seg>
<seg id="64">The main pathological findings of the autopsy are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="65">Naked Eye Examination: chest inflammation, cardiac inflammation, lung and lung edema</seg>
<seg id="66">Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:</seg>
<seg id="67">Mild Pneumonia: lung edema, lung cell hyperplasia, large number of atypical lung cells, interstigmesia accompanied by lymphocytes infiltration and</seg>
<seg id="68">Severe Pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (Dad) accompanied by diffuse alveolar seepage.</seg>
<seg id="69">Dad is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) and severe hypoxia.</seg>
<seg id="70">Recovery Pneumonia: mechanisation of alveolar cavity and interlung fibrosis</seg>
<seg id="71">Blood: diffusing intravascular coagulation (Dic); Young White-young red cell reaction</seg>
<seg id="72">Precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home; avoiding entering crowded areas; washing hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; avoiding touch without washing hands eyes, nose or mouth.</seg>
<seg id="73">The CDC recommends using tissue to cover your mouth and nose when cough or sneezing; if there is no tissue, the inner side of the elbow is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is recommended to properly clean your hands after cough or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="75">CDC suggests wearing masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus to some extent by asymptoms. at the core of social distance strategy is closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large public gatherings, thus reducing access to large-scale groups.</seg>
<seg id="76">Plus, social distance guidelines provide for at least 6 Feet (1.8 m) distance in interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="77">There are no effective drugs to prevent covid-19 yet. Since vaccines are expected to be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce peak outbreak is key to controlling the spread of covid-19, what we know as "draw epidemiological curves".</seg>
<seg id="78">At the same time, the CDC suggests that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is a toilet or when there is obvious dirt on their hands, before meal and after blowing their nose, cough or sneezing.</seg>
<seg id="79">In addition, it is recommended to wash your hands with at least 60 % alcohol content, but only when there is no soap and tap water around you. for areas where water free hand washing can't be purchased, who offers two recipes for local production.</seg>
<seg id="80">These recipes inspire antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.</seg>
<seg id="81">Using hydrogen peroxide helps eliminate bacterial spore in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not " hand sterilized active</seg>
<seg id="82">Add Glycerin As Moisturizer.</seg>
<seg id="83">Providing supportive care for people, which could include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support.</seg>
<seg id="84">CDC suggests that suspected virus carriers wear easy masks.</seg>
<seg id="85">In vitro membrane oxygen synthesis (ECMO) has been used to relieve respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits remain to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="86">It is recommended to improve immunity by maintaining personal hygiene and promoting healthy lifestyles and eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="87">Supportive therapy may be effective for those infected with early light disorders. Who and China's National Health Council have launched an initiative calling for proper care of covid-19 patients admitted to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="88">U.S. critical pathologists and lung experts have compiled treatment advice from various agencies and made available free through ibcc.</seg>
<seg id="89">As of December 2020, Covid-19 special therapy has not been developed.</seg>
<seg id="90">For some symptoms, some medical experts suggest using paraminophone (Acetaminol) instead of ibuprofen treatment.</seg>
<seg id="91">Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, completing operations that can produce aerosol in medical environments such as intubing or hand ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="92">For paramedics looking after covid-19 patients, the CDC suggests that patients should be transferred to airborne infectious disease isolation rooms (Aiir), in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) during the outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="93">Recommended Equipment: PPE protective clothing, breathing or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If you can, it's better use a breaker (not masks).</seg>
<seg id="94">N95 masks are allowed to be used in industrial occasions, but FDA has been authorized to use this mask under emergency use (Eua).</seg>
<seg id="95">It is mainly used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but there is no guarantee effective isolation of specific biological agents when used for other purposes.</seg>
<seg id="96">If there is no masks, CDC suggests using masks and can wear homemade masks if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="97">Most Covid-19 cases have lower symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.</seg>
<seg id="98">Paramedics are actively conducting research in hopes of providing breathing support for covid-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that high flow oxygen therapy or dual-phase airway positive pressure ventilation can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="99">It is unclear whether the two treatments mentioned above will have the same therapeutic effect for serious patients.</seg>
<seg id="100">If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use creative mechanical ventilation because the technique can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to hyperflow oxygen therapy. Severe cases are mostly among older people (especially those over 80 years old).</seg>
<seg id="101">Many developed countries are not enough beds per capita, and due to limited medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the grim situation in the surge in covid-19 cases.</seg>
<seg id="102">A study in China found that 5 % of patients need to be sent to ICU, 2.3 % of patients need mechanical ventilation and 1.4 % will die as a result.</seg>

<seg id="150">It is identified as a potential for immunity based on other corovirus behavioural features, but some covid-19 cases reportedly tested positive soon after recovery.</seg>
<seg id="151">These cases are believed to be a deterioration of infection rather than re-infection.</seg>
<seg id="152">The virus is believed to be a natural virus that originated in animals and is infected by spill.</seg>
<seg id="153">The actual origins have yet to be determined, but as of January 2019, the scope of infection was almost exclusively human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="154">The first batch of 41 confirmed covid-19 case studies released in January 1, 2020, showed that the earliest date of disease was 1</seg>

<seg id="156">Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.</seg>
<seg id="157">These numbers vary from region to region and will vary over time, and be affected by demographic features such as age, quality of health systems, treatment, the first outbreak and general health status.</seg>
<seg id="158">At the end of 2019, who designated ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07. 1 TO LABORATORY DIAGNOSED SARS-Cov-2 infections, designated u07. 2 to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed infections Covid-19 but undiagnosed sars-Cov-2 deaths without lab. The death rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="159">According to John Hopkins University Statistics, the global death rate was 6.9 % (153,822/2,240,191) as of January 17</seg>
<seg id="160">Death rates vary from region to region. other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infectious mortality (Ifr), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of diagnosed people diagnosed, which reflects the number of deaths from diseases (including diagnosed and undiagnosed) percentage.</seg>
<seg id="161">These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of specific populations from infection to case resolution.</seg>
<seg id="162">Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infections.</seg>

<seg id="167">So far, 69 people (0.004 % of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="168">The impact and mortality rates vary by gender.</seg>
<seg id="169">Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates than women.</seg>
<seg id="170">Men aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death, with the gender gap in only 90 years old.</seg>
<seg id="171">China's male mortality rate is 2.8 % and female mortality rate is 1.7 %.</seg>
<seg id="172">The exact cause of this gender difference is unclear, but it may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.</seg>
<seg id="173">Gender-based immunology differences, women have lower smoking rates and men with syndrome (such as high blood pressure), leading to higher mortality rates for men than women.</seg>
<seg id="174">In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected, and the total number of deaths due to covid-19 is as high as 72 %.</seg>

<seg id="179">Who in charge tedros adhanom ghebreyesus explains this :CO represents " Crown vi represents " viral d represents " Disease 19 represents the first outbreak of the outbreak (January 31, 2019 day).</seg>
<seg id="180">The name was chosen to avoid quoting specific geographic locations (such as China), animal species or populations in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that triggered covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-Cov-2).</seg>
<seg id="181">In addition, who also uses the " Covid-19 virus " and " triggered covid-19 ".</seg>

<seg id="187">An Italian hospital, for example, urgently needed ventilation valves, the supplier could not deliver parts within the required time, a local startup carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 ventilation valves overnight.</seg>
<seg id="188">Conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origins, prevention, treatment and other areas of the disease were spreading quickly through the origins of the covid-19 outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="189">Humans seem capable of spreading the virus to other animals.</seg>
<seg id="190">Studies have found no evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.</seg>
<seg id="191">No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of the disease have been approved.</seg>
<seg id="192">Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs to treat covid-19</seg>
<seg id="193">In December, the world health organization launched a "solidarity test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects</seg>
<seg id="194">There are currently no vaccines, but agencies at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="195">As Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 both enter human cells through ace2 receptors, there is a need to take advantage of previous SARS-Cov's previous work.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three vaccine strategies are being studied.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="198">The use of such viruses, both inactive or death viruses, aims to provoke a rapid immune response in the body when new covid-19</seg>
<seg id="199">The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines designed to develop a vaccine that inspire the immune system to respond to certain subunits of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="200">IN THE CASE OF SARS-Cov-2, such research focused on s-assisted viruses that invades the ace2 enzyme receptors.</seg>
<seg id="201">The third strategy is to develop a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA OR RNA VACCINE, a new technique for vaccine development).</seg>
<seg id="202">The safety and effectiveness of test vaccines developed by these strategies must be tested. Four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical trial for vaccine on January 16, 2020</seg>
<seg id="203">The vaccine contains harmless sequences of genes from the virus that cause the disease. It has been argued that antibody Dependencies could be a major challenge in developing sars-Cov-2 vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="204">As of January 2020, more than 300 clinical trials were conducted.</seg>
<seg id="205">Seven tests have been evaluated and approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="206">Converted antiviral drug use accounts for the vast majority of China's research, with nine stage III clinical trials in multiple countries by the end of 4</seg>
<seg id="207">As of December 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of covid-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has begun. Several existing antiviral drugs for covid-19 are currently being evaluated, including redcivie, chloroquine and hydroxychlopinawi / litonawi and lopinawi / litonawi interferon beta.</seg>
<seg id="208">As of January 2020, redseway's therapeutic effect has been initially confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="209">The clinical symptoms of patients with sympathy medicine redsiway have been relieved.</seg>
<seg id="210">Stage III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. In December 2020, CHINA LAUNCHED CHLOROQUINE (used to treat malaria) research with initial results.</seg>
<seg id="211">However, there are calls for peer reviews for the study.</seg>
<seg id="212">Health authorities in South Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.</seg>
<seg id="213">However, wuhan virology institute recommends taking 1 grams per day, while reminding double doses are dangerous and even fatal.</seg>
<seg id="214">On December 28, 2020, FDA issued emergency use licenses for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to treat covid-19 patients with both of these two drugs. China's seventh edition of the guide also proposes to treat covid-19. Using Interferon, ribaverin or abidore hydrochloride.</seg>
<seg id="215">Preliminary data suggests high doses of ribaverin vitro inhibiting sars-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="216">After confirming the low concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-Cov-2, it is recommended to conduct further in-body research using nidst. Studies have shown that the original thorn induced by Trasine 2 (tmprss2) is a necessary condition for SARS-Cov-2 interact with ace2 receptors into the human body.</seg>
<seg id="217">Whether combined with achimycin or not, chloroquine research has serious limitations that the medical community cannot accept these treatments unless further study. OSTAWAY HAS NO INHIBITORY EFFECT ON SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and has yet to be therapeutic for covid-19</seg>
<seg id="218">Cytokine storms could become a complication of post-treatment for covid-19 severe illness.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-Cytokine storms. After completing a small study, China's National Health Committee on health included tobeads in the treatment guide.</seg>

<seg id="4">These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the checkout counter or on the chain's Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="5">Buyers are hoarding goods for fear of covid-19 in case they need self-segregation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchases delivered to door to each single pack on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before these changes, Woolworths and coles introduced the limit of 4 PACKS PER TRANSACTION ON MARCH 4 AND 5, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coles reported in its press release on March 8th that " many stores are still sold out within one hour after arrival " and said demand is " unprecedented," meanwhile, Aldi called it " unexpected " in Tuesday's Facebook post.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last week's sales "dramatically increased". according to a woolworths spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last week, Canberra's Costco store also limited the number allowed to two packs.</seg>
<seg id="11">To further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered greater packaging from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stock while aldi prepared in advance for the planned Wednesday special offer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian retailer s' Association, says retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council's restrictions on the delivery time of trucks make it difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">He expects that production costs will rise and preferential activities will decrease as suppliers try to meet demand.</seg>
<seg id="14">Aldi announced Tuesday that some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday's special event after early release of inventory.</seg>
<seg id="15">At News.Com. In a au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of science and technology, says the store replenish inventory every night.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said toilet paper is large items and therefore less stock, and that once sold out, leaving huge shelf space, adding to the shortage of supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">" Coles and Woolworths's view is that if there were a lot of things on the shelves, goods such as rolls and hand washing fluid could [Buy] and in sufficient quantities." Russell Zimmerman told ABC news.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recycled Toilet Paper Maker who gives a crap said last Wednesday they are running out of stock</seg>
<seg id="19">According to News.com. Kimberly-Clark, who made shujie toilet paper and solbent toilet paper both stressed that they were working all day and weekends to guarantee supply.</seg>
<seg id="20">Real Estate website Domain.com reports that some real estate agents will offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, as buyers are closed on the long weekend.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nt news, a daily printed in Darwin City, contains 8-page centerfold in its Thursday edition of newspaper designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.</seg>
<seg id="22">The store was initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia on March 3, saying they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other commodities is also high, including masks, hand washing, dry goods, hand washing and flour.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also, outside Australia, UK online supermarket ocado limited the number of Andres toilet paper purchases to 2 Packs, 12 volumes per pack on Sunday night.</seg>

<seg id="6">We have had some tough situations since this month.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the face of the covid-19 epidemic, we clearly felt the fate of all humanity, while recognizing our responsibility towards each other.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are facing unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best measures to address such challenges require people around the world to feel, work together and promote community building, which is at the core of wikimedia.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spread of friendship and care to each other through emails, phone and chatting, is ample proof of the extraordinary nature of our colleagues and how fortunate we have been able to work with you.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am so grateful and proud to be colleagues with you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.</seg>
<seg id="12">They made me realize how meaningful it is that Wikipedia is now available around the world, while also making me realize the symbolic power that this crucial resource keeps running properly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whether your job is in charge of website operations, pay or community safety, Wikimedia's hard work.</seg>
<seg id="14">The world now needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="15">At this stage, the content of our work and the way we work will have a significant impact on the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">In view of the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities that our colleagues have shouldered, we will make some important changes to the way we work together starting next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Working methods and schedule adjustment</seg>
<seg id="18">As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how the company works and schedule over the next few days to months.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the meeting, we considered what we consider the appropriate response to the challenges facing companies today, as well as best practices to ensure companies sustainable development during the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Executive team has agreed to relieve stress for company employees so that you can support the company's mission in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">We support you to properly relieve work stress.</seg>
<seg id="22">For all employees, contractors and contract workers:</seg>
<seg id="23">Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week), with further notice of any changes.</seg>
<seg id="24">This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer every day, we will arrange tasks based on how long you work.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping or visiting a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="26">We won't track your working hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you're sick, please drop your work.</seg>
<seg id="28">Although this is self-evident, we still want to remind you that you can rest assured.</seg>
<seg id="29">You don't need to take sick or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key work areas are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="30">(if you are diagnosed as covid-19 positive, please inform Bryan of talents and culture operations that the department will support you and ensure that your situation gets proper attention from management. PM</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hourly Pay, we will pay in full.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have already expressed and again pledged to keep the promises made to contractors and colleagues in the hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated based on the compensation they receive for completing normal working hours.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if you're sick or unable to work is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you are willing to work, we will support you.</seg>
<seg id="36">Many choose to communicate with the outside world through work to release their stress.</seg>
<seg id="37">Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in times like this.</seg>
<seg id="38">But taking care of yourself is still first.</seg>
<seg id="39">We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep up to date with you and make adjustments accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Important jobs are guaranteed priority.</seg>
<seg id="41">We have to keep some important work running properly.</seg>
<seg id="42">The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, hr operation team, trust and security teams and fundraising teams (and other teams) are crucial, which may require additional support.</seg>
<seg id="43">We will start assessing current goals with all departments and shifting our focus to supporting something that are essential to our mission.</seg>
<seg id="44">We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus our work on the most important items.</seg>
<seg id="45">Slowing down for the moment will not affect future development.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are not planning to "overtime" after the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="47">We won't ask you to catch up overtime because now it doesn't seem realistic.</seg>
<seg id="48">We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="49">What changes will the app (Annual Plan)?</seg>
<seg id="50">In order to accommodate the new reality and daily working time requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for 2020-2021</seg>
<seg id="51">We hope to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time spent on budgeting so that staff can prioritize key jobs and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, adjust for those who need or wish to reduce their work in the coming weeks organization of work.</seg>
<seg id="52">Extending the timetable could significantly reduce the current planned workloads across the organization and reduce work pressure.</seg>
<seg id="53">We will present the above proposal to the board next week. If the proposal is passed, we will update the representatives and the teams as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="54">Thanks to the app team for the leadership in the process.</seg>
<seg id="55">Office condition, exposure and cleaning</seg>
<seg id="56">Last week, we learned that a San Francisco office colleague may have been exposed to the covid-19 virus.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, with caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to complete disinfect the San Francisco Office.</seg>
<seg id="58">They used hospital-level sterilization solutions to sterilize various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.</seg>
<seg id="59">The Office building is fulfilling its due diligence agreement by using corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.</seg>
<seg id="60">We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is fully prepared for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="61">Our Washington DC office is using the wework office, wework shares the covid-19 agreement with us and all Washington DC staff.</seg>
<seg id="62">As of last week, the Washington DC office has been converted to telecommuted to full staff in accordance with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco Office.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, as some colleagues at the New York office already know, we have been discussing issues related to renting offices in Brooklyn area.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is a need to update on the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 " suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases "</seg>
<seg id="2">On December 2, 2020, our team released the " quick recommendation guide to the diagnosis and treatment of new cov infections of the 2019 new cov (2019-Ncov) infection, through which we have been used for the global response to the global response to the experience and lessons are provided.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, 2019 Covid-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this letter, we respond to an opinion on the aforementioned guide and provide an update based on the latest covid-19 Treatment Program (Version 19) released by the National Health Health Committee of the people's Republic of China " diagnostic criteria for suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases</seg>
<seg id="5">2019 new corona virus (2019-Ncov) erupted in December 2019, which has been officially named 2019 Covid-12 Covid-19 the virus was once named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 Corona virus (SARS-Cov-2).</seg>
<seg id="6">Who (who) listed covid-19 as a global pandemic on December 3, 2020</seg>
<seg id="7">To Combat Sars-Cov-2 infections, our team developed a quick recommendation guide, which was released online in military medical research magazine on January 06, 2020</seg>
<seg id="8">It has attracted widespread attention since its release.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, please note that covid-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the National Health Committee of the people's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released a total of 7 Version of the covid between 1 to January 16-19 treatment program, some of which has changed significantly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who have proposed a simple scoring program based on their clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their work provides new evidence for our guide and valuable reference to the global pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="13">We recognize and thank them for this important work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest covid-19 Treatment Program (trial version 19) and recent research.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the seventh edition (January 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires combining an epidemiological historical feature with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis without a clear epidemiological history three clinical manifestations need to be met:</seg>
<seg id="16">Epidemiology History: (1) travel or residence in wuhan city and around wuhan city or other communities reported cases within 14 days before symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-Cov-2 infections (positive) ;(3) Covid-14 days before symptoms appeared with covid-19 was reported from wuhan city or other reported patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the community have a history of contact; (4) with aggregate diagnosed cases (within 2 weeks before symptoms, contact with fever and / or respiratory symptoms) such as home, office, school classes, etc) have a history of contact.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clinical Performance: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of covid-19 infections; (2) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreasing early in the disease, and</seg>
<seg id="18">Diagnosis of diagnosed cases should be based on suspected cases and with any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) Real-TIME PCR TEST FOR SARS-Cov-2; (2)) viral full genome sequencing shows highly homology with known new corovirus ;(3) specific igm and igg antibodies targeted at SARS-Cov-2 In Serum tests; or SARS-Cov-2 the specific igg antibody goes from negative to positive, or increased by 4 times during recovery period, higher than in the acute period.</seg>
<seg id="19">As we can see, the second version (January 18, 2020) and third edition (22) add real-time pcr in respiratory tract or blood specimen testing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Blood Specimen Pathogenic test was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and 2th Edition (8) and serum was added to the seventh edition learn the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">The changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nuclear acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens including blood harvesting, which increases the availability of different specimens and to incorporate positive results of specific antibodies into diagnosis the standard provides evidence.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, there is growing evidence to remind us of atypical symptoms and symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou and others should be updated because they categorize people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, scoring systems need to be validated in further clinical practices and research.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to give their views.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the diagnosis of " suspected cases " and " diagnosed cases we recommend reference and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our team will also update our guide in time to help.</seg>

<seg id="1">2019 lab tests for respiratory covid-19 and related Sars-Cov-2 virus include: detecting the presence of the virus and whether antibodies are produced after infection.</seg>
<seg id="2">RT-PCR CAN DETECT RNA of corona and determine whether the virus is present in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="3">This test is a specific test for SARS-Cov-2 VIRAL RNA.</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be used to determine whether recently been infected or active infection.</seg>
<seg id="5">Antibody Detection (Serum test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antibody Tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with minor symptoms without reporting or asymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="7">This test results determine the exact mortality rate of disease, as well as population immunity levels.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to limited number of tests, no country / region was able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population as of October 2020</seg>
<seg id="9">As of December 23, no country / region tested more than 3 percent of its population, and the number of tests completed vary dramatically across countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">The discrepancy can also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which in some countries, may be severely overrated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (Rrrt-PCR) test using throat swab can only get reliable results only within the first week of infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Generally, results can be obtained in a few hours to 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">RT-PCR Tests using swabbing can only get reliable results only within the first week of infection with the virus.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but continues to breed in the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="15">For those infected who are tested in the second week of infection, the sample can be replaced with deep respiratory extract obtained through phlegm pipe or cough extract (phlegm).</seg>
<seg id="16">Rrt-PCR was released at charitÃ© hospital in Berlin in January 2020, one of the early pcr tests and became 250,000 tests distributed by the world health organization, who) the basis of the test box.</seg>
<seg id="17">On January 1, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical, PCR-Cov-2 Test Kit (Powerchek Coronavirus).</seg>
<seg id="18">It looks for all the "e" Genes shared by beta corona virus, as well as the rdrp genes unique to SARS-Cov-2 in China, the bgi group is one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from China's National Drug Administration for the production of SARS-Cov-2 Test Kit. In The United States, the CDC has distributed 2019 new corona virus (2019-Ncov) Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panels to public health labs through the International Reagent Resources Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">Early versions of the test kit used three genetic testing methods, one of which could not be determined due to a defects in the test, while at the same time, the Atlanta CDC has detector bottlenecks; this led to daily throughout February 2020 the average number of samples successfully processed is less than 100</seg>
<seg id="20">The State and local labs were not allowed to start testing until January 28, 2020</seg>
<seg id="21">The test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. U.S. Commercial Labs started testing in early January 3</seg>
<seg id="22">Labcorp announced that covid-19 testing based on RT-PCR will be available nationwide starting from January 5, 2020</seg>
<seg id="23">Quest Diagnostics has also announced that it will be available nationwide covid-19 testing starting January 9</seg>
<seg id="24">No quantity limit announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Russia, Covid-19 testing is developed and produced by the National Center for viral and biotechnology research (Vector).</seg>
<seg id="26">On January 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian federal health supervision agency. On December 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test box that can detect covid-19 infection. On December 3, 2020, A Roche Diagnostics Test method was approved by FDA, which can complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, allowing a device to be within 24 hours about 4,128 tests were conducted.</seg>
<seg id="27">On December 3, 2020, FDA Issued Emergency Use Authorization (Eua) Using Abbott's M2000 System for testing (Eua) to abbott labcorp and Thermo Fisher scientific similar authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="28">On December 21, 2020, a cepheid test that took about 45 minutes was also granted an emergency use of FDA.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FDA has approved a test method to replace pcr with isothermal amplification technology.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the method does not require a series of thermal cycles, positive results can be produced in just 5 minutes and negative results can be determined within 13 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">The United States currently has about 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a method for testing using monoclonal antibodies (specially combined with the new corona virus) Protein (n protein) in the hope that it can be in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid flu test provide test results.</seg>
<seg id="32">A review of the literature in January 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnosis of the chest is of little, and the performance of ct [ computer fault scanning ] may be obvious, even in symptoms before appearing"</seg>
<seg id="33">Typical features of ct include double lung multi-Leaf Grinding Glass Shadows, with peripheral asymmetrical</seg>
<seg id="34">As the disease progresses, subbra dominant, gravel road signs and lung changes will be developed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study comparing pcr and ct in wuhan (where the current pandemic's initial outbreak) shows that ct is much more sensitive than pcr, but with lower precision of ct, its many imaging features with other pneumonia overlap with disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">As of December 2020, the American radiological society recommended that "ct should not be used to screen covid-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing covid-19". since January 3 at first, CDC suggested using pcr for initial screening.</seg>
<seg id="37">Part of the immune response to infection is producing antibodies, including igm and igg.</seg>
<seg id="38">These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections around 7 days after symptoms begin to determine the immune status of people subject to monitoring. The measurements can be done in central laboratory (CLT) or through instant detection (Poct).</seg>
<seg id="39">Many High-Flux Automated systems in clinical labs can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.</seg>
<seg id="40">For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequential samples, it is usually measured using a peripheral blood specimen.</seg>
<seg id="41">For Poct, skin piercing is usually used to get a blood sample.</seg>
<seg id="42">Extraction Steps are not required before determination, unlike the pcr method. On December 26, 2020, FDA approved 29 declared testing methods that are now able to distribute their antibody test kits.</seg>
<seg id="43">As of December 7, 2020, FDA had approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late October 2020, the test kits of eumong and epitope diagnosticks were approved in Europe, which could detect igg and iga antibodies in blood samples.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours, thus, in measuring viral RNA IS MUCH FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL PCR.</seg>
<seg id="45">Normally, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. in early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased was enough to use.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hong Kong has set up a mechanism for suspected patients to stay at home: " the er provides sample tube " to patients," patients spit saliva into the test tube and then send the test tube, and will receive results later. The UK NHS announced it is experimenting a home program to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of infection with others while travelling to hospital and the risk that patients must disinfect ambulances after using an ambulance. Health care professionals can take appropriate precautions to take appropriate precautions to extract samples while carrying out-off-off-19 cases.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Free-off testing center has helped south korea conduct faster and widest tests than other countries. In Germany, the National Association of legal health insurance physicians said on December 2 that non-hospitalized institutions are capable of about 12,000 tests a day, and 10,700 tests have been tested last week.</seg>
<seg id="48">If tests are conducted at the request of a doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Director of the Robert Koch Institute of Germany said Germany's total detection capability is 160,000 per week.</seg>
<seg id="50">As of December 19, free car tests have been provided in multiple major cities.</seg>
<seg id="51">As of December 2020, 3, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is not known as only the number of positive results were reported.</seg>
<seg id="52">An initial lab survey revealed that a total of 483,295 samples (including week 12 of 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples were detected as of week 12 6.9 %) SARS-Cov-2 POSITIVE. Researchers in Israel, technion and rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for simultaneous detection of 64 patient samples, that is a combined sample, and further tests only when the combined sample is found positive. In Wuhan, Huadae (Bgi) temporarily established a 2000 Square Meter Emergency testing laboratory called " fire eye which was put into operation on December 5, 2020 and can handle 10,000 per day. Multiple samples.</seg>
<seg id="53">The lab was built in 5 DAYS UNDER WANG JIAN, founder Wang Jian, and modeling shows that if the above detection capability was not achieved, the cases in hubei would be 47 % higher and the corresponding processing isolation costs. It will double too.</seg>
<seg id="54">Following the wuhan lab, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and shanghai instantly established fire eye labs, currently 12 cities in China.</seg>
<seg id="55">As of January 4, 2020, the total daily flux of lab testing was 50,000 per day. Open Source, Multi-way design released by Origami Assays, allows covid19 test for up to 1122 patient samples by just 93 tests. These balanced designs can run in small labs without automatic Liquid remover.</seg>
<seg id="56">As of January, shortage and shortage of reagents have become obstacles to mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="57">This LED some sponsors to explore sample preparation schemes that involve heating samples to 98Â°C (208Â°F) to 5 minutes to release the rna genome for further detection. The United Arab Emirates announced on December 31 that it has now undergone new corovirus tests for more of its population than any other country and is expanding its testing levels to allow large numbers of people to be tested pm</seg>
<seg id="58">The way to achieve this detection capability is by using drive-through testing and funding for group 42 and hua big Gene (based on its "fire eye" emergency testing laboratory in China) high flux lab for crowd testing demand.</seg>
<seg id="59">Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR Tests every day, and is the world's first lab of its size to operate outside China.</seg>
<seg id="60">China, France, Germany, China, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the corovirus gene mapping.</seg>
<seg id="61">The World Health organization has adopted Germany's method of producing test kits, sending test kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kit.</seg>
<seg id="62">Germany's methodology has been announced on January 1, 2020; the program developed by the CDC is only available after January 28, limiting testing in the United States ability. China and the United States both faced problems with the reliability of test boxes early in the outbreak, both countries and Australia are unable to provide enough test boxes to meet demand and health expert s' recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="63">Instead, experts believe extensive testing in South Korea can help reduce the spread of the new corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thanks to the testing capability established by the south korean government over the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private sector labs.</seg>
<seg id="65">On December 16, the world health organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow down the covid-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to high demand for testing, causing hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private labs, and the supply of wipes and chemical reagents is starting to straining.</seg>
<seg id="66">In December 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test kit.</seg>
<seg id="67">In The United States, testing kit developed by CDC has " flaws and the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hinder private laboratory testing. Spain purchased test boxes from the Chinese company shenzhen iri biotechnology co. Ltd. Found that the test results are inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="68">The company explains that the inaccurate test results could be caused by incorrect collection of samples or incorrectly using the test kit.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Spanish cabinet said it would be recycled back to the wrong results and replace it with another one provided by shenzhen bioeasy. 80 % of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1200 million test boxes from China and found inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="70">Prime Minister matoviÄ suggested these test boxes should be thrown into the danube. AteÅkara of turkey's ministry of health said the test boxes purchased from China was " very high " and did not " put them into use ". Britain purchased 3500 million test boxes from China, these test boxes were declared unavailable in April 2020</seg>
<seg id="71">Positive results can be achieved by testing and isolating people who are positive and tracking the exposure of SARS-Cov-2 positive people.</seg>
<seg id="72">Researchers working in the Italian city of vÃ³ (the first covid-19 patient died) conducted two rounds of tests for a total of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">About half of them tested positive and symptomatic, and all cases found were segregated.</seg>
<seg id="74">New infections have been completely eliminated by taking travel restrictions on the community.</seg>
<seg id="75">Through Mass tracking of contacts, restricting entry travel, detection and isolation, the 2020 Corona virus is slower in Singapore than other developed countries / regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictions such as mandatory close restaurants and retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="76">Singapore cancelled many activities and residents are advised to stay at home on January 28, but schools resume classes on 23 after the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="77">Several other countries / regions, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also curbed the epidemic of the disease through mass tracking contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation, and less radical blockades.</seg>
<seg id="78">A statistic study found that countries with the higher the number of deaths, the lower case mortality rates are detected, possibly because those countries are better able to detect only minor symptoms or asymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="79">Who suggested countries that have no testing capability and National Labs Deal with covid-19 experience, sending their first five positive and first ten negative covid-19 samples to 16 who participated validation tests are performed by one of the lab.</seg>
<seg id="80">Of these 16 reference labs, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 IN NORTH AMERICA AND 1 in Australia pm</seg>
<seg id="81">In the chart below, " testing positive %" list is affected by the country's testing policies.</seg>
<seg id="82">In other cases of the same conditions, countries that only test hospitalized residents have a higher rate than those that test all citizens, whether they appear symptoms or not.</seg>

<seg id="4">Multiple cases of pneumonia were reported in wuhan, China's hubei province on December 31, 2019</seg>
<seg id="5">On December 9, 2020, the CDC reported that pathogen is a new type of corona virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="6">Since then, the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 infections has been named Corona Disease (Covid-19).</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence so far suggests that about 80 % of covid-19 cases are minor disorders, i.e. respiratory infections accompanied or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.</seg>
<seg id="8">In about 14 % of cases, Covid-19 will progress in serious illness and require hospitalization, while the remaining 6 % of cases progresses to critical condition and require serious care.</seg>
<seg id="9">The death rate of patients hospitalized for covid-19 is about 4 %.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this study, we assessed the trends of cumulative prevalence rates in the EU / European Union, EU / European economic area, eea, as well as the UK (UK) rates of covid-19 China's hubei province made comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="11">We also compared the existing number of covid-19 cases in EU / eea countries and the UK from 31 to 15 January 2020 in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">EU / eea countries and UK Covid-19 cases</seg>
<seg id="13">Following China, the geographic distribution of covid-19 has expanded further, and the dynamic changes in the covid-19 epidemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.</seg>
<seg id="14">On December 3, 2020, the director-General of the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="15">In The European Surveillance Magazine, published on January 2020, 3, spiteri and others reported the first confirmed covid-19 cases in Europe based on who's Case definition.</seg>
<seg id="16">In EU / Eea, France reported the earliest three confirmed cases on December 2020, 1, 24, returning nationals of wuhan city, China's hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="17">Covid-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU / eea countries and the UK as of January 2020, 2019 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported on December 15, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">GET CUMULATIVE NUMBER AND CUMULATIVE RATES OF COVID-19 cases</seg>
<seg id="19">The European centers for disease control (Ecdc) updates the number of covid-19 cases reported in each country every country around the globe obtained only through official sources such as health ministries, National and regional health authorities and who.</seg>
<seg id="20">The data has been used to evaluate EU / eea and UK Covid-19 trends and compare them with Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">We calculate 14 days of interceptions cumulative rates for each EU / eea country and covid-19 cases in the UK between 1 to 15 January 2020 as an indicator of prevalence of active covid-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of covid-19</seg>
<seg id="22">We also provide the cumulative total number of cases reported in each country as of 8:00 am on January 3, 2020, as of January 31 data in Italy were compared for the period 15</seg>
<seg id="23">EU / eea countries and UK Covid-19 trends</seg>
<seg id="24">The trend of 14-day intercepted cumulative rates in EU / eea countries and the UK's Covid-19 cases overall is consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="25">For EU / eea and the UK as a whole, the cumulative rate of covid-19 has increased since around 21 January 2020 and then dramatically increased around 28 (supplements) material).</seg>
<seg id="26">This is mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU / eea countries, as well as covid-19 in the UK, showed a similar growth trend (supplements).</seg>
<seg id="27">Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of covid-19 cases in EU / eea countries and the UK from 31 to 15 January 2020, and with Italy comparisons are made.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is important to stress that as of 8:00 am on January 15, 15 other EU / eea countries and the UK have reported in less than 3 weeks total number of cases.</seg>
<seg id="29">Our results show that the number of covid-19 cases reported by EU / eea and the UK is rapidly increasing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The observed cumulative rate trend in covid-19 shows that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, the definition of cases may differ from country and used to choose must undergo covid-19 diagnostic tests - including additional tests -- patients the program differs, but the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">Around 10 % of covid-19 patients needed serious care, according to doctors in the affected regions of Italy in early January 2020, while media reports said hospitals and critical care in these areas the ward has reached its maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the EU / eea level, the data currently available are only 6 % and 1 % of covid-19 cases admitted to ICU (data not shown).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, this information should be collected in a systematic way to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.</seg>
<seg id="35">A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of critical care and mid-term care beds available in European countries ranged from 29.2 to 100 in Germany Portugal'S 4.2 pieces vary.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and mid-term care beds per 100 million people in 2010-2011).</seg>
<seg id="37">Ecdc's sixth update to covid-19 rapid risk assessment modeled scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, and prevalence and hospitalized covid-19 patients in each EU / eea country and UK the risk of overweight custody bed &amp;gt; 90 % relationship is estimated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since cases have so far gathered in EU / eea countries and certain areas of UK, and hospitals and icu usually serve the population covered populations in identified areas, it is preferably in "Standard Statistics Geographic Unit 2" (Nuts-2) level provides information on cases and critical care beds.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Italian experience and current trends in other countries suggest that the EU / eea and the UK's Covid-19 epidemic is growing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, the state, hospitals and ICU should be prepared to respond to the ongoing community spread of SARS-Cov-2 and the increase in the number of covid-19 patients in need of medical care, especially in critical care, for example, what happens in the affected regions of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the recent ecdc rapid risk assessment points out, a quick, positive and comprehensive approach is crucial to slowing the spread of SARS-Cov-2, and needs to move from curb to relief because, if not implemented early, the rapid growth in the number of cases may be expected let policymakers and hospitals don't have enough time to understand, accept and adjust the response.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Rapid Risk Assessment Also lists public health measures to alleviate the effects of the pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is now a short window of opportunity that countries may further step up control to slow sars-Cov-2 spread and relieve stress on the health care system.</seg>
<seg id="44">Otherwise, other EU / eea countries's healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in need of serious care in the coming days or weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Origin of human coronary virus</seg>
<seg id="2">Mutation and adaptability have propelled the co-evolution of coronaviruses, cov and its host (including humans) for thousands of years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2003, two types of human corona virus (Hcov) were known to cause minor diseases such as common cold.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome, mers, turning the situation, reveals the devastating and deadly nature of hcov infections.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sars-Cov-2, which appeared in Central China at the end of 2019, once again made cov the focus of attention, surprisingly, compared to its sister virus SARS-Cov, but pathogenic low sex.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hcov infection is a common disease in humans and animals, so understanding the origin of hcov's common disease will help us.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most hcov come from bat and are non-pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some Hcov's intermediate storage hosts are also known.</seg>
<seg id="9">Identifying animal hosts is of direct significance to preventing human diseases.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studying the interaction of cov hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of human cov.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this review, we outlines the existing knowledge of seven types of hcov, highlighting their history of discovery, the origins of common disease, and inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Importantly, we compared and contrast different hcov from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombinations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Against this backdrop, we explore the current outbreak of 2019 Covid-19 Covid-19</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, this article also focuses on the requirements for successful completion of host conversion and the impact of viral evolution on the seriousness of disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cov belongs to the corovirus division, composed of a group of justice single-chain rna viruses with mask.</seg>
<seg id="16">These viruses have the largest genome of rna viruses, containing 2.6 to 32 million alkaline bases, known as "Cov" (Cov) for being cov for being coroneath an electron microscope.</seg>
<seg id="17">Structurally, cov has non-segmented genomes that share similar tissue.</seg>
<seg id="18">About Two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (orf1a and orf1b) that are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replica polymer.</seg>
<seg id="19">These polymers are further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1~ 16.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rest of the genome consists of orf of structural proteins, including stabbing (s), Mask (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (n).</seg>
<seg id="21">Many Genealogy-specific auxiliary proteins are also cov of different genealogy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Based on the differences in protein sequences, cov is divided into four genes (a-Cov, Beta-Cov, Gamma-Cov and Delta-Cov), in which the beta-Cov contains most hcov and subdivided into four genealogy (a, b), c and d).</seg>
<seg id="23">System Development evidence suggests that bats and rodents are genes for most a-Cov and beta-Cov, while birds are the main hosts of Gamma-Cov and Delta-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="24">For thousands of years, cov has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, 7 types of corona virus (Hcov) are known to be infected with people.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among them, Hcov-229 e and hcov-Nl63 Are Alpha-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="27">5 other beta-Cov include hcov-Oc43, Hcov-Hku1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov (SARS-Cov), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Cov and SARS-Cov-2.</seg>
<seg id="28">Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 typically cause minor symptoms such as common cold and / or diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, SARS-Cov, Mers-Cov and newly discovered sars-Cov-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in relatively more patients and more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute response distress syndrome, ards) and lung performance.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the mid-20 s, the first hcov-229 e virus strain b814 was separated from the nasal secretion of ordinary cold patients.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since then, humans have accumulated more knowledge through extensive research on both hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 viruses that can cause self-limiting symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, before the sars outbreak, the notion that hcov was usually harmless had been widely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outbreak of sars in 2003 was one of the most destructive events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10 %.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ten years later, the outbreak of middle east breathing syndrome (Mers) continues to spread across the Arabian Peninsula and sporadic spread to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">2019 new hcov virus (2019-Ncov, later renamed SARS-Cov-2) is a continuing epidemic of 2019 Covid-2020 Covid-19 more than 3,120 lives were taken on January 3 and infected more than 91,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The alarm has gone off, and the globe must be ready for the upcoming SARS-Cov-2 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="37">All 7 types of hcov have a common origin of human and animals from bat, rats, or domestic animals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Multiple evidence suggests that all hcov evolution originated in bat, which are well adaptable, non-pathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Covid-19 epidemic poses huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.</seg>
<seg id="40">Tracing Hcov's co-disease origins provide the framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and restrictions of viral species jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, it will guide or boost the search for SARS-Cov-2 Storage Hosts, intermediate host and expand animal hosts, which is important in preventing future virus spills.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this review, we outlines the origins, Inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of hcov's common disease.</seg>
<seg id="43">In particular, we highlighted and explored a common topic, that hcov's parent virus is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after cross species spread to new host.</seg>
<seg id="44">In addition, we look back at the trend of hcov evolution, in which an increase in spreadability is often accompanied by a decline in pathogenicity.</seg>
<seg id="45">Against this backdrop, we also discussed the results of the ongoing sars-Cov-2 Outbreak.</seg>
<seg id="46">Animal Cov has been widely known since the late 20 s.</seg>
<seg id="47">Before Hcov-229 E Strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, medical scientists had been among various infected animals (including turkey, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs) different covs are separated from the middle.</seg>
<seg id="48">Over the last few decades, 7 Hcov have been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="49">A brief summary of the history of hcov discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with abundant information and guidance.</seg>
<seg id="50">In 1966, the first hcov-229 e strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection and then adapted to growth in wi-38 lung cell strains.</seg>
<seg id="51">Patients infected with hcov-229 e have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, throat pain, and 10 % of patients have fever, cough, etc.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the second half of 1967, Hcov-oc43 was separated from organ culture and subsequent successive generations of the brain of mice.</seg>
<seg id="53">The clinical features of hcov-oc43 infections are similar to hcov-229 e infections and are not much different in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza a and nasal virus.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 are distributed globally, mainly in winter in temperate climate.</seg>
<seg id="55">Usually, the two viruses incubation period is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks later.</seg>
<seg id="56">A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected hcov-229 e experience a mild common cold.</seg>
<seg id="57">Only a handful of patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="58">Sars, also known as " Atypical Pneumonia is the first fully documented pandemic in human history by hcov, whose pathogen is SARS-Cov, the third discovered hcov.</seg>
<seg id="59">The first sars case dates back to China's Guangdong Province in late 2002</seg>
<seg id="60">Sars Outbreak LED to 8,096 reported cases, 774 dead and spread to many countries and continents.</seg>
<seg id="61">In addition to super spreads, it is estimated that each case may bring about 2 further cases, incubation period of 4 TO 7 days, with a peak viral load on day 10 of onset.</seg>
<seg id="62">Patients infected with SARS-Cov initially showed muscular pain, headache, fever, discomfort and chill, followed by terminal symptoms such as breathing difficulties, cough and breathing distress.</seg>
<seg id="63">Reducing Lymphocytes, abnormal liver function and elevated kinase are common lab tests in sars.</seg>
<seg id="64">In addition, diffusing alveolar injuries, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in sars patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">About 20-30 % of patients then needed serious care and mechanical ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Among these seriously ill patients, multiple organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal in patients with low immunity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="68">Since then, people have been working on hcov research.</seg>
<seg id="69">Hcov-nl63 was separated from a 7-Month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004</seg>
<seg id="70">The virus was initially found to flow amongst toddlers, seniors and immune-impaired patients suffering from respiratory disorders</seg>
<seg id="71">Among diseases caused by Hcov-Nl63, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common.</seg>
<seg id="72">Another independent study shows that the same virus was isolated from specimens of a 8-Month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.</seg>
<seg id="74">Hcov-nl63 is estimated to account for about 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, with peak in early summer, spring and winter.</seg>
<seg id="75">Hcov-nl63 is associated with obstructive larynglub laryngrub larynitis.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the same year, Hcov-hku1 was separated from a 71-Year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and microbronchitis.</seg>
<seg id="77">In addition to community access to sexual pneumonia and bronchitis, Hcov-hku1 has been reported to be linked to acute asthma attacks.</seg>
<seg id="78">Similar to hcov-Nl63, Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 has been detected worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="79">All four of these four communities have well adapted to humans and are often less likely to mutations that cause high pathogenic diseases. But there have also been accidents for unknown reasons, such as a more toxic subtype of hcov-Nl63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.</seg>
<seg id="80">Often, when these hcov gain the ability to effectively spread and survive within the human body, their toxicity or pathogenicity is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mers-Cov was first separated from a 60-Year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012</seg>
<seg id="82">Although most laboratory diagnosed cases come from the middle east, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary sexual transmission to close contacts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In 2015, further sexual transmission erupted again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.</seg>
<seg id="84">Mers's clinical performance is similar to sars, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="85">Unlike Sars, many mers patients also suffered from acute renal failure, a unique feature of mers from hcov-induced diseases so far.</seg>
<seg id="86">More than 30 % of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vom</seg>
<seg id="87">As of December 2, more than 2500 confirmed cases reported in the lab, with a death rate of up to 34.4 percent, making mers-Cov the most destructive virus known to humans one.</seg>
<seg id="88">People with aggregate pneumonia were detected in wuhan city, China's hubei province in late mid-12, China's hubei province, linked to SARS-Cov-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="89">The World Health Organization declares the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a public health incident of international concern and named the disease covid-19.</seg>
<seg id="90">As of December 2020, 90,053, 3 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 %.</seg>
<seg id="91">It is noteworthy that the disease death rate is 4.2 % in hubei, China, while in regions outside hubei is 1.2 %.</seg>
<seg id="92">Like Sars-Cov and mers-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested by fever, cough and difficulties in breathing.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some patients also suffer from diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pneumonia is one of the worst symptoms that can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="95">Although Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 are very similar due to 82 % of the homology of high-nucleotide sequences, they cluster into different branches in the system development trees.</seg>
<seg id="96">Sars-Cov-2 is significantly lower than SARS-Cov and mers-Cov-Cov, but more contagious.</seg>
<seg id="97">Sars-Cov-2 Asymptomatic infections are reported, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="98">Comparing Sars-Cov-2 WITH 6 other hcov types, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.</seg>
<seg id="99">First, the incubation period and duration of hcov disease are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="100">On this point, SARS-Cov-2 is in line with the overall trend of 6 other hcov.</seg>
<seg id="101">Second, the degree of covid-19 symptoms ranges between SARS-Cov and 4 Community-acquired hcov (i.e. Hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-hku1 and hcov-Nl63).</seg>
<seg id="102">On the one hand, SARS-Cov-2 infections are more common in community-acquired hcov infections, including non-specific, mild and even symptomatic expressions.</seg>
<seg id="103">On the other hand, a small percentage of severe covid-19 cases are also found in SARS-Cov infections, albeit slightly lower.</seg>
<seg id="104">Third, SARS-Cov-2 spread also shows interesting patterns of community access to sex hcov and SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the one hand, SARS-Cov-2 is at least as high as community access to hcov.</seg>
<seg id="106">On the other hand, whether sars-Cov-2'S-2 will decline after human transmission, LIKE SARS-Cov and mers-Cov remains to be verified.</seg>
<seg id="107">Finally, like other hcov, SARS-Cov-2. Can be detected in poop samples.</seg>
<seg id="108">At least in some cases, whether sars-Cov-mouth transmission plays an important role as in SARS-Cov, remains to be clarified from future research.</seg>
<seg id="109">It is also important to see if sars-Cov-2 is as seasonal as community access to hcov.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, SARS-Cov-2 features such as the spread, pathogenesis and continuous transmission from generation will have a significant impact on the ultimate fate of the current covid-19 epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="111">All 4 communities that cause minor symptoms have been well adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="112">From another perspective, humans have adapted well to these 4 Hcov.</seg>
<seg id="113">In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient hcov epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="114">Hcov, which caused severe human disease and those suffering from severe hcov disease have died.</seg>
<seg id="115">For this reason, hcov must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to combat host restriction factors.</seg>
<seg id="116">In this sense, the longer the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic persists, the more people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be adapted to humans.</seg>
<seg id="117">If it adapts well, its spread among humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infections control measures.</seg>
<seg id="118">Over the years, these 4 communities have been spreading across the population, leading to common cold in people with normal immune function.</seg>
<seg id="119">These viruses don't need animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="120">By contrast, the highly pathogenic sars-Cov and mers-Cov have not adapted well to humans and cannot spread among humans.</seg>
<seg id="121">They need to survive and reproduce among human and animal disease host, and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human goals through one or more intermediate hosts and expanding host.</seg>
<seg id="122">Sars-Cov-2 features similar to SARS-Cov / Mers-Cov and 4 community access hcov.</seg>
<seg id="123">It is as highly contagious as community-acquired hcov, at least for now.</seg>
<seg id="124">However, it is more pathogenic than community access to hcov, less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="125">It remains to be seen whether it can adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host.</seg>
<seg id="126">Before discussing the animal origins of hcov, it is a guide to us to discuss the definition and features of hcov's evolving host, natural host, storage hosts, intermediate host and expanding host.</seg>
<seg id="127">If an animal has closely related ancestors that are highly homology at the level of a nuclear otide sequence, the animal will become an evolving host of hcov.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ancestral viruses are usually adaptable and pathogenic in this host.</seg>
<seg id="129">Also, storage hosts carry hcov on a long term basis.</seg>
<seg id="130">In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of hcov or its parent virus.</seg>
<seg id="131">By contrast, if hcov just parasitic in the middle host or immediately parasitic in the human body, it will not be well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.</seg>
<seg id="132">This intermediate host can act as a common source of human infections in humans and livestock, and play the role of zooming the host by allowing the virus to replicate briefly and then spread it to humans to humans to expand the scale of human infections.</seg>
<seg id="133">If hcov cannot maintain its spread within the middle host, terminal infection can occur.</seg>
<seg id="134">Instead, hcov can adapt to intermediate hosts and even build long-term locality.</seg>
<seg id="135">In this case, the middle host becomes natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="136">A Retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that sars index cases have a history of exposure to hunting animals.</seg>
<seg id="137">The subsequent seropositive rate survey showed that animal vendors had a higher level of immunoglobulin g (Igg) than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the living animal market, the fruit Beaver (flour) and a beaver cat were first found carrying sars-Cov-like viruses almost identical to the SARS-Cov virus.</seg>
<seg id="139">The fact that there are no further sars reports after clearing all the beavers in the market indirectly supports this view.</seg>
<seg id="140">However, reports allege that the testing of SARS-Cov by farm beaver in wild or uncontacted living animal markets is basically negative, suggesting that the fruit beaver may be just the middle zoom host rather than the natural host of SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="141">It is noteworthy that since 80 % of the different animals on the GUANGZHOU MARKET HAVE SARS-Cov antibodies, it is not ruled out that multiple small mammals could also act as well as SARS-Cov Intermediate.</seg>
<seg id="142">All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="143">A subsequent study of SARS-Cov natural animal hosts found a closely related bat corona virus known as SARS-Linked Bat Corona Virus Hku3 (Sarsr-RH-Batcov Hku3), which survives in chinabata inside the body.</seg>
<seg id="144">These bats are positive for SARS-Cov antibodies and sarsr-RH-Batcov Hku3's genome sequences.</seg>
<seg id="145">The virus and other bat corona virus has 88-92 % of the nuclear sequences homology with SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="146">These studies lay the groundwork for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="147">In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS-like cov (SL-Cov) from bats, but none of the virus can be separated as live viruses except for a designated wiv1.</seg>
<seg id="148">Human Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 (ace2) is known as the receptor of SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="149">Experiments show that wiv1 extracted from bat poop samples uses bats, Beaver and human ace2 as its receptors into cells.</seg>
<seg id="150">It's interesting that serum from sars recovery patients can neutralize wiv1.</seg>
<seg id="151">By far, wiv1 is the closest ancestor to BAT SARS-Cov, with 95 % homology of nuclear otide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="152">Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, wiv1 is usually thought to be the DIRECT PARENT VIRUS OF SARS-Cov, and the bat is not the direct storage host of SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="153">System Development analysis categorizes mers-Cov as bat cov-Hku4 And Bat Cov-hku5</seg>
<seg id="154">Bat Cov-hku4 and mers-Cov invade the virus using the same host receptor dipeptides enzyme 4 (dpp4).</seg>
<seg id="155">Mers-Cov's rna dependent rna polymerase sequence is closer to its counterparts in bat beta-Cov from Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="156">So far, no living mers-Cov has been found inside wild bat.</seg>
<seg id="157">Mers-Cov has only 87 % homology with its closest bat cov-hku25</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore, bat may not be the direct storage host of mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="159">On the other hand, studies in the middle east show that monoca is positive for mers-Cov-Cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels from several african countries.</seg>
<seg id="160">Living Mers-Cov isolated from the swab of the swab is the same as the human body, further indication that the camel is the real storage host of mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is also important to note that among camels experimenting mers-Cov, the general symptoms are mild, but a large number of viruses have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is noteworthy that infected camels not only spread the virus through respiratory tract, but also through the dung mouth, but the dung pathway is also the main way for bat to release the virus.</seg>
<seg id="163">However, the problem remains because many mers diagnosed cases have no history of contact with camels before symptoms arise, which may be attributed to human-person-to-to-to-person or unknown pathways of transmission, including unrecognized animal species carrying mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="164">Sars-Cov-2 has a 96.2 % nucleotide homology with the bat cov ratg13 separated from the Chamomile Bat.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the case of SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, the sequences between SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 are too big to determine a parent-Generation Relationship.</seg>
<seg id="166">In other words, unless almost identical bat corovirus is found in the future, bat may not be the direct storage host of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="167">Presumably, the middle animal host of SARS-Cov-2 should be sold and slaughtered at South China's seafood wholesale market, many of the original covid-19 cases are linked, suggesting the possibility of animals to animals to-to-2 human spreading events.</seg>
<seg id="168">Several recent studies based on macro genome sequencing suggest that an endangered small mammammammal known as panga (Malay Panga) may also carry the ancestors associated with SARS-Cov-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="169">These new pangerine corovirus genomes are homology with SARS-Cov-2 % of the nucleotide sequences.</seg>
<seg id="170">But they are just as closely related to ratg13, with about 90 % homology at the nuclear sequence level.</seg>
<seg id="171">Among the system development trees, they are classified as two sars-Cov-2 Virus Sublines, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) TO SARS-Cov-2 and has 97.4 % of amino acid sequences homology.</seg>
<seg id="172">In Stark contrast, SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 differ rbd, despite higher sequences of the whole genome.</seg>
<seg id="173">An earlier study on sick pangles also reported the detection of viral overlung samples, with a similar relationship to SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="174">The study employs different assembling methods and manual treatments and obtained parts of the genome sequences that make up about 86.3 % of the virus genome.</seg>
<seg id="175">We can't rule out the possibility that pangler is one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="176">However, due to the differences in the beta-Cov sequences associated with the PANGLIA SARS-Cov-2, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 is directly from the pangerture.</seg>
<seg id="177">In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and ratg13 is even shorter than the beta-Cov-Cov associated with SARS-2</seg>
<seg id="178">Sars-Cov-2 evolution pathways in bats, pangles and other mammals are still to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="179">While the highest sequence homology has been found in RBD BETWEEN SARS-Cov-2 and the pangliance, the SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov-Cov-2 and ratg13 have the highest the whole genome sequence homology.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is highly speculated that the high resemblance between the PANGERNAIL SARS-Cov-Cov-2 related beta-Cov-2 is caused by selective convergence evolution.</seg>
<seg id="181">Another opposing view is that the PANGERPILLAR SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov and ratg13 are reunited in a third wildlife species.</seg>
<seg id="182">As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widely present in beta-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is no decision on the origins of the direct human and animal disease of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="184">In addition to highly pathogenic hcov, researchers also studied the common origins of hcov-229 e, Hcov-Oc43, Hcov-nl63 and hcov-Hcov-hku1</seg>
<seg id="185">System Development evidence suggests that hcov-nl63 and hcov-229 e may have originated from the bat cov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 parent viruses have also been detected in rodents.</seg>
<seg id="186">Reports say the discovery in North American Tricolor Bat called arcov. 2 (Apalachian Ridge Cov)'s bat corona virus shows a close connection to hcov-nl63</seg>
<seg id="187">On the other hand, Hcov-229 e has a genetic link to another type of bat corovirus found in Ghana, known as hipposideros / Ghanakwam / 19/2008, and camel animals are suspected to be the host pm</seg>
<seg id="188">For the sake of clarity, figure 1 AND TABLE 2 summarize existing knowledge about the animal origins of known hcov.</seg>
<seg id="189">System Development analysis provides evidence of historical interspecies transmission of hcov.</seg>
<seg id="190">Around 1890, when hcov-oc43 infects humans from cross-species of livestock, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.</seg>
<seg id="191">The history of inter-seed transmission of hcov-229 e is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Bat A-Cov, closely associated with hcov-229 e, has been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="193">An alpaca a-Cov appeared between the two.</seg>
<seg id="194">There's multiple evidence supporting the virus spreading directly from bat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="195">First, humans, not alpaca, may be in touch with bat in common eco-location.</seg>
<seg id="196">Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.</seg>
<seg id="197">Second, the bat a-Cov associated with hcov-229 e is diverse and non-pathogenic in bat, while alpaca a-Cov causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.</seg>
<seg id="198">Finally, alpaca a-Cov was not found in wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="199">Therefore, the possibility that alpaca will receive hcov-229 E-related a-Cov from humans cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="200">In fact, bats are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, nipa and hendra virus.</seg>
<seg id="201">Therefore, it's not surprising that bats spread hcov-229 e directly to humans.</seg>
<seg id="202">Or, although bat a-Cov Acts as a gene bank of hcov-229 e, alpaca and monoca may be intermediate host of spreading the virus to humans, exactly the case with mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mers-Cov is a good illustration of the spread of species from bat to single-Peaks and from single-Peaks to humans.</seg>
<seg id="204">Bat's Mers-Cov evolution origins were known in their initial identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforced this argument.</seg>
<seg id="205">Apparently, bat provides a rich pool of viral species for interplant exchange and spread of gene fragments.</seg>
<seg id="206">Longevity and intensive groups, close social interaction and strong flying capability are all favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal " virus spreads</seg>
<seg id="207">On the other hand, Mers-Cov has been inside the single-Peaks for decades.</seg>
<seg id="208">It's well adapted to these camels, and the camels have gone from middle host to stable natural storage host.</seg>
<seg id="209">Mers-Cov causes very slight disease in these animals and remains relatively low mutation rates.</seg>
<seg id="210">Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and since it is not sustainable, humanity remains the terminal host of mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="211">Compared to the role of camels in the spread of mers-Cov-Cov-2 is different, if any, compared to the role of camels in the spread of mers-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="212">In particular, pangles beta-Cov is highly pathogenic in pangles.</seg>
<seg id="213">They may be terminal hosts of SARS-Cov-2 related beta-Cov, similar to the beaver in SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="214">Several possibilities for SARS-Cov-2 spread from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out in future research.</seg>
<seg id="215">First, the bat may be the storage host of SARS-Cov-2-2-related viruses almost identical to SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="216">Humans may share eco-location with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="217">Second, the pangler could be one of the middle-expanded host of the NEW SARS-Cov-2 related viruses.</seg>
<seg id="218">Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild flavors.</seg>
<seg id="219">Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2.</seg>
<seg id="220">There is a need to conduct antibody research on livestock and wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="221">Third, as mentioned above, SARS-Cov-2 may be reorganized and adapted in a third species that has been exposed to bat and pangles.</seg>
<seg id="222">Research on the origins of SARS-Cov-2 continues.</seg>
<seg id="223">In addition to different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus play an important role in promoting corona virus across interspecies barriers.</seg>
<seg id="224">First, they have higher mutation rates in rna replication.</seg>
<seg id="225">Compared to other single-chain rna viruses, the mutation rate of corona virus is estimated to be "Medium to" High with an average replacement rate of 2 per spot 10-4 per year, according to the adaptation phase of corona virus to new host. Time.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Corona virus has proofing activity, deleting it can lead to very high variability and decay and even survive.</seg>
<seg id="227">Interestingly, known nuclear side analog redsivir can inhibit coronary virus replication by inhibiting this RNA EXTRACT AND RNA-dependent rna polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="228">Redsiway is one of the most promising anti-SARS-Cov-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="229">However, the mutation rate of corona virus is about 1000 times higher than its host.</seg>
<seg id="230">Also, if the corona virus doesn't fit well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.</seg>
<seg id="231">Sars-Cov-2 mutation rate is significantly lower than SARS-Cov with a high mutation rate, suggesting that it is more adaptability to humans.</seg>
<seg id="232">Presumably, it has adapted to another kind of close to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to the mers-Cov that suited to the single-Peaks.</seg>
<seg id="234">In Theory, genetic drifting is unlikely to rapidly invalidate vaccines and antivirus targeting SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="235">Second, the larger rna genome in corona virus has additional plasticity in gene mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the possibility of interspecies coevolution, which is beneficial to the emergence of new corona virus when conditions fit.</seg>
<seg id="236">The Large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions towards genome 3 ' end coding provide proof.</seg>
<seg id="237">Third, Corona Virus Switches Templates randomly and frequently through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during rna replication.</seg>
<seg id="238">Chain Exchange happens frequently during cov rna transcription as host of mixed containers.</seg>
<seg id="239">Highly homologous full length and subgenomic rna can be recombining to produce new corona.</seg>
<seg id="240">Evidence of natural restructuring of system development has been found in hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 and animal corona viruses such as bat SL-Cov and bat cov-hku9</seg>
<seg id="241">Virus related to spreading - host interactions</seg>
<seg id="242">In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and host receptors is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="243">This article uses Sars-Cov's reorganization as a typical example, showing evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.</seg>
<seg id="244">Based on a comparison of isolated strains of human and fruits sars-Cov, researchers believe SARS-Cov can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially by mutations of s PROTEIN RBD.</seg>
<seg id="245">Usually, rbd in corona s protein interacts with cell receptors and is closely screened by host antibody reaction.</seg>
<seg id="246">In Sars-Cov, rbd is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids in the s1 clip, which combines with people ace2 and its co-receptors to enable the virus into the virus.</seg>
<seg id="247">Sars-Cov's rbd can identify ace2 receptors of various animals, including bat, Beaver, rats, mice and beaver cats, thus making the virus spread between species.</seg>
<seg id="248">In fact, ONLY 6 Amino acid residues have been observed in rbd with separate strain rbd, of which 4 of them are located in the receptor bonding with ace2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="249">K479n and s487t mutations exist in the RBD OF FRUIT BEAVER SARS-Cov, which may increase the affinity of fiber protein interact with human ace2 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="250">In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids could be crucial for the virus adapting to humans.</seg>
<seg id="251">It is noteworthy that SARS-Cov-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-Cov.</seg>
<seg id="252">The difference between SARS-Cov-2 AND SARS-Cov in the s protein s1 unit is 30 %, which means that their bond of s protein and human ace2 may change.</seg>
<seg id="253">Indeed, a refrigerated electroscopy study shows that the bond is 10 to 20 times more affinity between people ace2 and SARS-Cov s protein.</seg>
<seg id="254">It would also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in SARS-Cov-2 spread.</seg>
<seg id="255">Interestingly, Hcov-nl63 also combines with ace2, but with different parts of s.</seg>
<seg id="256">In addition, there are many other hcov receptors such as hcov-229 e amino peptides n and hcov-Oc43'S 9-O-acetylated saliva acid.</seg>
<seg id="257">They may also explain why the above-mentioned corovirus successfully adapted to humans after spreading across species from animal hosts.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to cell receptors, the results of hcov transmission are also influenced by other host dependencies and restrictive factors.</seg>
<seg id="259">The differences between these host proteins in humans and natural hosts of hcov such as bat, single-Peaks and rodents may pose an obstacle to inter-species transmission.</seg>
<seg id="260">Hcov must deprive hosts of dependency and break host restrictions to achieve successful interplant transmission.</seg>
<seg id="261">In this regard, the molecular deciding factor in the important area of viral-host interaction remains to be identified and represented.</seg>
<seg id="262">Impartial all genome screening of SARS-Cov-2 host dependencies and restrictive factors using the latest crispr technology could bear fruit</seg>
<seg id="263">The appearance of a new hcov: back to origin</seg>
<seg id="264">The Diversity of the bat corona virus offers ample opportunities for the emergence of a new hcov.</seg>
<seg id="265">In this sense, the bat crown virus serves as hcov's gene pool.</seg>
<seg id="266">In addition, rapid mutation and gene recombinations are also drivers of hcov evolution and two important steps in the process.</seg>
<seg id="267">For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could revolutionize the virus's phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="268">In Sars-Cov assisted proteins, orf8 is considered important for adapting humans due to isolation of SARS-Cov-Cov-related batviruses, but found that they can code different orf8 proteins.</seg>
<seg id="269">At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide missing features of SARS-Cov were found in isolated strains.</seg>
<seg id="270">This lack divides orf8 into orf8a and orf8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.</seg>
<seg id="271">In addition, SARS-Cov may have been reorganized with Alpha-and Gamma-Cov Genealogy, in which a large number of smaller recombinations have been found in RNA-dependent rna polymerase.</seg>
<seg id="272">Reorganization sites have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.</seg>
<seg id="273">Similarly, studies have shown that the mers-Cov epidemic has experienced a reorganization of different genealogy, which occurred in Saudi Arabia's single-Peaks.</seg>
<seg id="274">In addition to SARS-Cov and mers-Cov, reorganization incidents were also observed in other hcov, where hcov and other animal corona virus recombine in their unstructured genes.</seg>
<seg id="275">It should also be noted that artificial selection can lead to unexpected changes in the virus genome, most likely to relieving the selective pressure imposed by the virus, among others, the host immune system.</seg>
<seg id="276">An example of these functions is that in the hcov-229 e prototype strain which the lack of double nucleotides leads to the loss of full length orf4.</seg>
<seg id="277">Although the complete orf4 can be observed in the hcov-229 E-related bat and camel virus, alpaca alpaca-Cov shows a single nucleotide insertion, causing a mutation.</seg>
<seg id="278">Last but not least, the evolution of the new hcov is also driven by pressure of storage host s' choice.</seg>
<seg id="279">Asymptoms or only minor symptoms have been detected after the bat infected with the corona virus and bat.</seg>
<seg id="280">From an anatomy and physiologic point of view, bat seems to adapt well to the corona virus.</seg>
<seg id="281">For example, the defects in bat provocative response effectively reduce pathologic changes caused by coronary virus.</seg>
<seg id="282">In addition, bat's natural killing cell activity is inhibited due to positive regulation of inhibitory nkg2 / cd94 and lower expression levels of main tissue compatibility complex i molecules.</seg>
<seg id="283">Moreover, high levels of active oxygen (Ros) produced by bat's high metabolic activity can inhibit coronary virus replication, but also influence proofing through RNA Extract Enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the high pathogenicity of viral strains entering the new host</seg>
<seg id="284">More pathogenic corovirus strains may also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein features to suit the host.</seg>
<seg id="285">It is therefore no accident that three new hcov emerged over the last two decades.</seg>
<seg id="286">Corona virus does not cause disease or cause minor symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.</seg>
<seg id="287">They are replicating in large numbers without causing a strong host immune response.</seg>
<seg id="288">This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and cases of severe human infections.</seg>
<seg id="289">Severe symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of immune response and cytokine storms, the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury will be.</seg>
<seg id="290">In contrast, among symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from corona replication.</seg>
<seg id="291">The same strategy to unchain immune response may have a positive role in anti-SARS-Cov-2 treatments.</seg>
<seg id="292">Interferon in bats are particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="293">Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-Cov-2 infection.</seg>
<seg id="294">In addition, nlrp3 inflammatory body activation in bat also has flaws.</seg>
<seg id="295">Based on this reasoning, using mc950 to inhibit nlrp3 inflammatory body may be useful for covid-19 treatment.</seg>
<seg id="296">The appearance of SARS-Cov-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-Cov and mers-Cov were produced.</seg>
<seg id="297">Although 95 % Nuclear-Cov has been found to be homology with SARS-Cov, there is a bat corona virus homology with SARS-Cov-2 %.</seg>
<seg id="298">Although Beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-Cov, the direct intermediate host of SARS-Cov-2 has not been identified.</seg>
<seg id="299">The apparently same origin of the SARS-Cov has been discovered, which suggests that the pangler may be one of the middle hosts, or that the panglite beta-Cov may contribute to the final version of SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="300">Despite doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was made intentionally or unintentionally.</seg>
<seg id="301">Due to the recent SARS-Cov-2 Outbreak, the corona virus is back into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="302">Research into corona virus in bat and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the origins of hcov human and animal hosts in human transmission.</seg>
<seg id="303">There is ample evidence that SARS-Cov, Mers-COV AND SARS-Cov-2 originated from bat and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.</seg>
<seg id="304">Since Sars-Cov infections stem from human contact with fruit beaver on the market, closing the wet market and killing beaver could effectively end the sars epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="305">By the same token, in view of multiple genealogy of pangerals linked to SARS-Cov-Cov-2, pangles should be removed from the wet goods market to prevent the spread of human and animal disease.</seg>
<seg id="306">But whether and how SARS-Cov-2 spread to humans through pangles and other mammals remains to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="307">Mers-Cov, on the other hand, has been in the monoaks for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="308">These camels are important transportation and are the main source of local people's meat, milk, leather and wool products.</seg>
<seg id="309">They are widely distributed in the middle east and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="310">It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control mers, following the Chinese Wildlife Market To Prevent Sars-COV AND SARS-Cov-2</seg>
<seg id="311">In order to stop the re-outbreak of mers, a comprehensive approach should be taken in conjunction with other infections control measures to develop an effective anti-Mers-Cov vaccine for camels.</seg>
<seg id="312">As we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear, causing outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="313">Various people and animals have been infected with corona virus circulating in the wild environment.</seg>
<seg id="314">In particular, there is a high diversity of bat corona virus with the potential for human and livestock.</seg>
<seg id="315">These humans and animals have plenty of opportunities to evolve and reorganize, leading to a new corona virus that will become easier to spread and / or deadly in humans.</seg>
<seg id="316">In some parts of China, the culture of edible wildlife should be eliminated in order to reduce unnecessary exposure between humans and animals.</seg>
<seg id="317">After the severe test of sars, mers and covid-19, we should make better prevention and response plans.</seg>
<seg id="318">In fact, many viruses have existed on earth for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="319">They stay in their natural hosts until the chance of overflow.</seg>
<seg id="320">While bats have many features that favour the virus transmission, if people are educated away from bat and other wild species, human exposure to bats and other wild species will be greatly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="321">Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary in order to better understand the ecological condition of the corona virus and its natural host, which will prove very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="322">In Short, the most effective way to prevent viral human and animal disease is to stay away from the ecological position of the natural host of human and animals.</seg>
<seg id="323">The Mystery of the origin of SARS-Cov-Cov-2 remains a few missing.</seg>
<seg id="324">First, if bats SPREAD AN ANCIENT SARS-Cov-2 virus to the pangles, it would be meaningful to look into what circumstances bat and pangles can share the same eco spot.</seg>
<seg id="325">Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans are in contact with bat remains to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="326">Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species including humans, bat and pangles.</seg>
<seg id="327">Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, can be vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2, monitoring and experimental infections research should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="328">If it's bats, pangles or other mammals, SARS-Cov-2 or almost identical parent virus is expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.</seg>
<seg id="329">Continued research in this field will reveal how SARS-Cov-2 evolved in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human covid-19</seg>
